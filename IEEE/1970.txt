  "In this paper, the decoder of a convolutional code is modeled as an autonomous stochastic sequential machine and finite Markov chain theory applied to obtain a precise expression forP_{FD} (u), the probability of error associated with the feedback decoding of theuth subblock of information digits. The analysis technique developed extends directly to any convolutional decoder for a linear convolutional code, used for transmission over a finite state channel. The limit ofP_{FD} (u)asutends to infinity, when the limit exists, is termedP_{FD}, the steady-state probability of error of feedback decoding. Sufficient conditions on decoders are given in order forP_{FD}to exist, and two classes of minimum-distance decoders exhibited that meet these sufficient conditions.P_{FD}is calculated for an example using the binary-symmetric channel and found to satisfyP_{FD} \\le P_{DD}whereP_{DD}is the probability of error associated with feedback-free decoding of the same code."
"A different approach toward the information channel capacity of a photographic film is presented. It is based on the total number of possible combinations of the smallest distinguishable regions in a piece of photographic film. The information channel capacity of a hologram is also discussed. It is found that the information capacity of a hologram is somewhat lower than that of a photographic film. However, the information content of a hologram is, in general, greater than that of a photograph. It is the recording process used in making a hologram that provides the advantage over an ordinary photograph. Nevertheless, if the object to be recorded were properly encoded, then the information content of a hologram could never reach that of a photographic film."
"Optimal (least-mean-square linear) filtering of random signals prior to sampling may be represented as a Wiener-Kalman state-variable filter followed by a coder that synthesizes the signal to be sampled as a linear combination of the estimated states. Although the prefilter doubles the number of states of the overall presampling signal process, the postsampling reconstruction filter need only model the original signal generator and the coder. Overall optimization involves selecting the parameters of the coder to minimize a weighted time-averaged error criterion."
"A discrete Fourier transform method for factoring arbitrary spectral density functions is presented. The factorization can be implemented in a straightforward and efficient manner, and it does not require that the spectra be rational. An expression for the absolute error is also presented."
"It has not been noted in the literature that finite-memory least-squares, recursive filters are unstable, and hence unsuited for a large number of recursions. This correspondence modifies the finite-memory least-squares recursive filters to allow for stable solutions."
"Algorithms to decode iterated codes when at least one of the \"component codes\" is majority decodable are given. The decoding algorithms allow the use of the decoders of the component codes and still make it possible to correct all error patterns guaranteed to be correctable by the minimum distance of the iterated code."
"A general solution is obtained for the probability density function of the low-pass output of a crosscorrelator with bandpass inputs. The input signals are sinusoidal with arbitrary amplitudes and phases, and the noise inputs are Gaussian and uncorrelated. An approximation to simplify the necessary calculations is developed and examined."
 "A method for the design of time-limited and effectively band-limited waveforms for analog communication systems is developed. The design problem is first formulated in theL_2 (0, T)space. Nonlinear modulation threshold effects are incorporated directly into the design by introducing constraints in the form of minimum distance between points on the locus. It is shown that all pertinent information can be expressed in terms of the inner product function generated by the locus and its cross derivative. The design is then transformed into a constrained minimization problem in a space of inner product functions. The cases of stationary locus andN-dimensional locus are further investigated."
"It is shown that there are arbitrarily long \"good\" (in the sense of Gilbert) binary block codes that are preserved under very large permutation groups. This result contrasts sharply with the properties of linear codes: it is conjectured that long cyclic codes are bad, and known that long affine-invariant codes are bad."
"We consider the problem of transmission of analog data over a noisy channel. It is assumed that the channel input is of the form\\surd S f(t, X), whereXis ann-dimensional source vector, andSis the allowable transmitted power. The performance of any given modulation schemef(t, \\cdot )as a function of the transmitted powerSis studied. Lower bounds on the average distortion produced by noise for a class of distortion functions are derived. These bounds relate the \"smoothness\" of modulation techniques to the minimum error that can be achieved with them. It is shown that when the analog source emits a sequence of mutually independent real random variables at a rate ofRper second, the mean-square error that is associated with any practical modulation schemef(t, \\cdot)decays no faster thanS^{-2}as the signal powerS \\rightarrow \\infty. It follows that in the case of a band-limited additive white Gaussian channel no single modulation schemef(t, \\cdot )can achieve the ideal rate-distortion bound on the mean-square error for all values ofS, if the channel bandwidth is larger than the source rateR."
"A counterexample to a conjecture on the number of constraint lengths required to achieve the free distance of a rate1/nsystematic convolutional code is presented."
 "This correspondence presents 11 tables of best unshortened Fire codes of length up to 1200 bits, classified into groups according to their relative redundancy."
"In this correspondence, a modification of Rudolph's one-step majority-logic decoding algorithm is introduced. Using this modification, it is proved that all single-error-correcting codes can be one-step majority decoded."
  "Except for some elementary definitions and fundamentals, the theory of AN code is by and large the theory of binary (radix = 2) arithmetic codes. It is often believed (erroneously) that this theory can be readily generalized to any nonbinary radix. The very fundamental theorems of Brown and Peterson on single-error-correcting codes have been derived for the binary case only. Whereas a generalized version of Brown's theorem can be stated and proved relatively easily (as shown here), the one for Peterson's theorem is not forthcoming. However, we have succeeded in deriving a theorem for the ternary case (radix = 3) somewhat along the lines of the Peterson's theorem as follows. LetM_3 (A, d)denote the smallest positive integer such that the arithmetic weight ofA M_3 (A, d)in ternary representation is less thand. Also leyA = 2pfor some odd primep. Then 3 is a primitive element ofGF(p)if and only if \\begin{equation} M_3 (A, 3)=(3^{(p-1)/2} + 1)/A. \\end{equation}"
"The minimum distance of a class of reversible cyclic codes has been proved to be greater than that given by the BCH bound. It is also noted that this class of codes includes the class of primitive double-error-correcting binary codes of Melas as well as the class of nonprimitive double-error-correcting binary codes discovered by Zetterberg as special cases."
"Stone^1found that multiple-error-correcting codes inherently have the ability to correct multiple bursts. Using his methods, somewhat stronger theorems are derived here, and a decoding procedure is given."
"In this paper, signal design in a burst-noise environment is considered. Two distinct approaches are presented, each resulting in a class of signals for which the trade-off between signal bandwidth and immunity to large-amplitude bursts is shown. In the first approach the design is treated as an optimization problem subject to energy and endpoint constraints in a fixed time interval, and a uniform probability distribution of the location of the burst within the interval. The second approach considers signal design as a two-player differential game, where design flexibliity is obtained through the second player's choice of an initial value in the resulting differential equation. Performance curves for signals designed by using both methods are compared. It is shown how the first design procedure is easily extended toM-ary alphabets, thus obtaining the full advantage of the proposed technique."
"A systematic procedure for constructing binary self-orthogonal diffuse codes is presented. These codes correct both random and burst errors. A lower bound on actual constraint length for this class of codes is found. The given construction procedure generally yields codes that approach the lower bound for large burst error correction and are, therefore, asymptotically optimal."
"Thekth-order exponential filter is analyzed using a two-dimensionalztransform. The weighting functions for both the data and the initial conditions are derived."
"The use of feedback with concatenation is proposed as a technique for achieving the desired performance with less system complexity. Feedback can be used with the inner code, outer code, or both. The concatenation error exponents for several feedback schemes employing the Gaussian channel are determined analytically and found to be significantly better than those of the channel with no feedback."
"This paper presents several results involving Fano's sequential decoding algorithm for convolutional codes. An upper bound to theath moment of decoder computation is obtained for arbitrary decoder biasBanda \\leq 1. An upper bound on error probability with sequential decoding is derived for both systematic and nonsystematic convolutional codes. This error bound involves the exact value of the decoder biasB. It is shown that there is a trade-off between sequential decoder computation and error probability as the biasBis varied. It is also shown that for many values ofB, sequential decoding of systematic convolutional codes gives an exponentially larger error probability than sequential decoding of nonsystematic convolutional codes when both codes are designed with exponentially equal optimum decoder error probabilities."
"It is shown that two covariance-type functions can completely characterize lognormal random processes and their likelihood functional can be a simple modification of the likelihood functional of their associated normal random processes."
 "A recent paper on polynomial codes[l] presented an important theorem concerning the BCH minimum-distance bound for the dual of a polynomial code. For a particular set of numerical examples, however, the theorem failed. This correspondence presents a modified version of the theorem that covers those cases and uses a method of proof, which, while rigorous, shows clearly the significance of certain concepts. The BCH bound on the minimum distance, however, remains the same."
"An equivalence between the rank permutation codes and a new class of binary codes has been observed. A binary code may be generated by direct transformation of a permutation code. The binary codes are usually nonlinear and may be decoded by the inverse transformation and rank correlation of the equivalent permutation."
 "The first-passage time problem for a continuous one-dimensional Markov process is reviewed, and upper bounds are obtained for both the probability of failure (or passage and the moments of the time to failure, in terms of the mean time to failure. In addition, stationary Gaussian variables arising from systems withNdegrees of freedom that have autocorrelation functions of the form \\begin{equation} R(r) = e^{-b \\mid \\tau \\mid} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} d_k^2 \\cos \\omega_k \\tau \\end{equation} are shown to be derivable from a2N-dimensional (or2N- 1, if one of the\\omega_kis zero) Markov process that possesses a \"pseudoenvelope,\" which is itself the result of a one-dimensional Markov process. This pseudo-envelope can be used as a bound on the magnitude of the Gaussian variable, and its first-passage time problem can be solved explicitly or utilized to obtain convenient bounds for the probability of failure of the Gaussian process."
"The mean-squared continuous Markov process of the separable class is represented by a nonlinear stochastic differential equation. The representation for the strictly stationary case implies that the process is determined by its autocorrelation function and first-order probability density function. A class of stationary Markov separable processes may be obtained by a zero-memory nonlinear (ZNL) transformation of a wider class of stationary Markov processes. A special case of the multidimensional process is shown to result in a separable process of degreeN. Several examples are considered to illustrate the representation."
"The purpose of this paper is to describe the bipolar reference concept. A bipolar reference is simply a reference that can take on a continuous range of both positive and negative numerical values. It will be shown that for map matching via the convolution operation, references that yield maximum signal-to-noise ratios, in general, will be bipolar references. Algorithms for generating bipolar references and digital simulation results are given."
"A method is presented for constructing distribution-free tolerance regions for one distribution based on the clusters of the sample from a second distribution. The tolerance regions are constructed so as to minimize the probability of reserve judgment in a two-class discrimination procedure that allows the conditional error probabilities to be controlled within prescribed upper bounds. The method results in discrimination functions that are easily implemented on a computer. Although the method is not, in general, consistent with optimal procedures, it is appealing for high-dimensional problems with multimodal distributions."
"Bayes optimal sequential structure and parameter-adaptive pattern-recognition systems for continuous data are derived. Both off-line (or prior to actual operation) and on-line (while in operation) supervised learning is considered. The concept of structure adaptation is introduced and both structure as well as parameter-adaptive optimal pattern-recognition systems are obtained. Specifically, for the class of supervised-learning pattern-recognition problems with Gaussian process models and linear dynamics, the adaptive pattern-recognition systems are shown to be decomposable (\"partition theorem\") into a linear nonadaptive part consisting of recursive matched Kalman filters, a nonlinear part--a set of probability computers--that incorporates the adaptive nature of the system, and finally a part of the correlator-estimator (Kailath) form. Extensions of the above results to theM-ary hypotheses case whereM \\geq 2are given."
"There are several approaches to unsupervised estimation that have application to problems of communications, control, and pattern recognition. This paper presents properties of several different digitally implemented algorithms suitable for unsupervised estimation. One result is the rate of convergence in mean square of the Bayes solution for a discretized parameter space. A regression function that is the expected value of the natural logarithm of the mixture probability density function naturally arises from the Bayes approach. This regression function can be used to devise unsupervised estimation algorithms of the stochastic approximation form. Also, the asymptotic solution and rates of convergence in mean square of a class of minimum-integral-square-difference algorithms are determined. Two other estimators that use a \"net\" on the parameter space are also presented."
"Thenth-order multiple coherence between a stationary random process andnother stationary random processes is decomposed into a sum ofncomponents consisting of products of lower order partial and multiple coherence functions. An inequality is derived between partial coherence and the ratio of ordinary coherence to multiple incoherence. As a result, a coherency diagram is suggested describing the different coherency functions and their relationships."
"A finite-state model for sequential minimum-mean-square-error estimation of a random variable in additive noise is analyzed to determine the dependence of optimum performance and structure on the memory size of the estimator. Necessary conditions for determining the structure of the optimum finite-state estimator are derived for arbitrary statistics. Numerical results are presented for Gaussian statistics. The performance of several different estimators is used to show the trade-off one may obtain between memory size, observation quality, and number of observations."
"A class of multiple burst convolution codes generated by encoders that are constructed using a single digital \"building block\" is given. The number of identical small sections used in the encoder depends upon the degree of error correction desired."
"Many of the best random error-correcting group codes known (cyclic or not) can be reduced to echelon canonical form, in which the parity matrix is mainly or entirely composed of one or several circulants. This correspondence deals with simple and efficients methods for coding and decoding such codes, called quasi-cyclic in recent literature. The main result is that when the parity matrixC, or its complement(C + J)are nonsingular, simplified and fast decoding methods based on the quasi-cyclic structure, and alternately using syndromes based respectively onCand onC^{-1}, permit correction to full error-correcting capacity. This is also extended to the (simplest) case of several parity circulants in a row."
"An existing sequential decoding program can be easily modified to enumerate the number of low-weight codewords in a convolutional code, where weight is defined either over a decoding constraint length or \"free.\" We tabulated several good rate one-half constraint-length 49 systematic codes that were obtained quickly with this procedure."
"A construction is given that combines an(n, M_1, d_1)code with an(n, M_2, d_2 = [\\frac{1}{2}(d_1 + 1)])code to form a(2n, M_1 M_2, d_1)code. This is used to construct a new family of nongroup single-error correcting codes of all lengthsnfrom2^mto 3 ·2^{m-1} - 1, for everym \\geq 3. These codes have more codewords than any group code of the same length and minimum distance. A number of other nongroup codes are also obtained. Examples of the new codes are (16,2560,3) and (16,36,7) codes, both having more codewords than any comparable group code."
"A convolutional encoder is defined as any constant linear sequential circuit. The associated code is the set of all output sequences resulting from any set of input sequences beginning at any time. Encoders are called equivalent if they generate the same code. The invariant factor theorem is used to determine when a convolutional encoder has a feedback-free inverse, and the minimum delay of any inverse. All encoders are shown to be equivalent to minimal encoders, which are feedback-free encoders with feedback-free delay-free inverses, and which can be realized in the conventional manner with as few memory elements as any equivalent encoder, Minimal encoders are shown to be immune to catastrophic error propagation and, in fact, to lead in a certain sense to the shortest decoded error sequences possible per error event. In two appendices, we introduce dual codes and syndromes, and show that a minimal encoder for a dual code has exactly the complexity of the original encoder; we show that systematic encoders with feedback form a canonical class, and compare this class to the minimal class."
"By using suboptimum decoding algorithm and certain criteria to select a generator sequence, error propagation can be avoided and recovery decoding errors can be minimized. These selection criteria can be applied to a sequential decoding algorithm that is based on a Hamming-distance decoding criterion."
 "In this paper we formulate the general problem of determining the photoelectron \"counting\" distribution resulting from an electromagnetic field impinging on a quantum detector. Although the detector model used was derived quantum mechanically, our treatment is wholly classical and includes all results known to date. This combination is commonly referred to as the semiclassical approach. The emphasis, however, lies in directing the problem towards optical communication. The electromagnetic field is assumed to be the sum of a deterministic signal and a zero-mean narrow-band Gaussian random process, and is expanded in a Karhunen-Loève series of orthogonal functions. Several examples are given. It is shown that all the results obtainable can be written explicitly in terms of the noise covariance function. Particular attention is given to the case of a signal plus white Gaussian noise, both of which are band-limited to\\pm BHz. Since the result is a fundamental one, to add some physical insight, we show four methods by which it can be obtained. Various limiting forms of this distribution are derived, including the necessary conditions for those commonly accepted. The likelihood functional is established and is shown to be the product of Laguerre polynomials. For the problem of continuous estimation, the Fisher information kernel is derived and an important limiting form is obtained. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation equations are also derived. In the latter case the results are also functions of Laguerre polynomials."
"The following theorem is proved. Letf(x_1,\\cdots, x_m)be a binary nonzero polynomial ofmvariables of degree\\nu. H the number of binarym-tuples(a_1,\\cdots, a_m)withf(a_1, \\cdots, a_m)= 1 is less than2^{m-\\nu+1}, thenfcan be reduced by an invertible affme transformation of its variables to one of the following forms. \\begin{equation} f = y_1 \\cdots y_{\\nu - \\mu} (y_{\\nu-\\mu+1} \\cdots y_{\\nu} + y_{\\nu+1} \\cdots y_{\\nu+\\mu}), \\end{equation} wherem \\geq \\nu+\\muand\\nu \\geq \\mu \\geq 3. \\begin{equation} f = y_1 \\cdots y_{\\nu-2}(y_{\\nu-1} y_{\\nu} + y_{\\nu+1} y_{\\nu+2} + \\cdots + y_{\\nu+2\\mu -3} y_{\\nu+2\\mu-2}), \\end{equation} This theorem completely characterizes the codewords of the\\nuth-order Reed-Muller code whose weights are less than twice the minimum weight and leads to the weight enumerators for those codewords. These weight formulas are extensions of Berlekamp and Sloane's results."
"In certain stochastic-approximation applications, sufficient conditions for mean-square and probability-one convergence are satisfied within some unknown bounded convex set, referred to as a convergence region. Globally, the conditions are not satisfied. Important examples are found in decision-directed procedures. If a convergence region were known, a reflecting barrier at the boundary would solve the problem. Then the estimate would converge in mean square and with probability one. Since a convergence region may not be known in practice, the possibility of nonconvergence must be accepted. LetAbe the event where the estimation sequence never crosses a particular convergence-region boundary. The sequence of estimates conditioned onAconverges in mean square and with probability one, because the sequence of estimates is the same as if there were a reflecting barrier at the boundary. Therefore, the unconditional probability of convergence exceeds the probability of the eventA. Starting from this principle, a lower bound on the convergence probability is derived in this paper. The results can also be used when the convergence conditions are satisfied globally to bound the maximum-error probability distribution. Specific examples are presented."
"The method of using auxiliary random noise to unbias the output of the multilevel digital correlator is investigated. It is shown that any random noise satisfying certain conditions may be used. The uniformly distributed noise that has been used previously in the polarity-coincidence correlator is a special case. Discretely distributed auxiliary noise, although not satisfying the conditions, has the same effect as quantizing the input signals more finely. The mean-square error of this modified digital correlator is analyzed."
"An upper bound on the estimation error in the threshold region (probability of threshold effect and mean-square error) is obtained for nonlinear pulse modulation systems. The problem is viewed in anN-dimensional Euclidean space. The space of all received signals is divided into two regions, corresponding to the two types of error: weak-noise approximation and threshold effect. The threshold region is geometrically upper bounded by a larger region, and the estimation error is obtained as a sum of incomplete\\Gammafunctions. The resulting bound on the mean-square error was found to be quite close for the cases calculated. An extension of the method to PPM system is also presented."
"This correspondence is concerned with the problem of choosing an approximation for the random variable obtained by operating on a stochastic processx(t)with a zero-memory non-linearity followed by a linear transformation. It is desired to approximate the nonlinearity with a simpler function and two different criteria are considered for selecting this approximation, viz., the mean-square error obtained before and after the linear transformation. A sufficient condition is presented-for an approximation to simultaneously minimize both error criteria; in addition, it is shown that if the two minima coincide for every linear transformation and every nonlinearity, this condition is also necessary. The condition appears as a restriction on the class of approximating functions and is related to the second-order distributions ofx(t). For several processes of interest, this restriction is satisfied when the approximating functions are polynomials, the most notable example being the Gaussian process."
"The problem of designing finite-pulse-train radar signals and receivers to maximize the detectability of targets in the presence of clutter has recently been solved. In practice, the performance of these optimum signal-receiver pairs is often degraded seriously by implementation errors. The purpose of this paper is to present an iterative procedure for designing signal-receiver pairs, which takes into account the effects of implementation errors. This method is compared with the error-free design technique by means of two examples."
"A channel modeling technique is described that looks at the communication problem from a new viewpoint. A quantity called unfolding capacity--the capacity of a channel as it happens to unfold--is defined. A theorem is derived that proves for the assumed channel model, a feedback scheme can be devised that for sufficiently largeN, achieves arbitrarily Iow probability of error at any rate less than unfolding capacity, no matter what capacity happens to unfold. The theorem also proves that this type of performance can not be achieved without feedback."
"A one-step threshold decoding method previously presented for cyclic block codes is shown to apply generally to linear convolutional codes. It is further shown that this method generalizes in a natural way to allow decoding of the received sequence in its unquantized analog form."
"In this paper, we establish the following result. Theorem:A_i, the number of codewords of weightiin the second-order binary Reed-Muller code of length2^mis given byA_i = 0unlessi = 2^{m-1}or2^{m-1} \\pm 2^{m-l-j}, for somej, 0 \\leq j \\leq [m/2], A_0 = A_{2^m} = 1, and \\begin{equation} \\begin{split} A_{2^{m-1} \\pm 2^{m-1-j}} = 2^{j(j+1)} &\\{\\frac{(2^m - 1) (2^{m-1} - 1 )}{4-1} \\} \\\\ .&\\{\\frac{(2^{m-2} - 1)(2^{m-3} -1)}{4^2 - 1} \\} \\cdots \\\\ .&\\{\\frac{(2^{m-2j+2} -1)(2^{m-2j+1} -1)}{4^j -1} \\} , \\\\ & 1 \\leq j \\leq [m/2] \\\\ \\end{split} \\end{equation} \\begin{equation} A_{2^{m-1}} = 2 \\{ 2^{m(m+1)/2} - \\sum_{j=0}^{[m/2]} A_{2^{m-1} - 2^{m-1-j}} \\}. \\end{equation}"
"Using a polynomial approach to linear codes, one derives necessary and sufficient conditions for cyclicq-ary codes to be invariant under the general linear group of substitutions over an extension field ofGF(q). The important class of polynomial codes, introduced by Kasami, Lin, and Peterson, satisfy the conditions and several new results are obtained about some of these codes."
   "Evaluation of complex systems in a laboratory environment requires the generation of inputs to the system sensors that are representative of the operational environment. It is therefore necessary to synthesize input test signals that reflect the mutual dependencies found in situ. For multivariate Gaussian inputs, algorithms are derived allowing 1) the transformation of dependent Gaussian random variables into independent variables; 2) the generation of jointly Gaussian random variables with a constant covariance matrix; and 3) the synthesis of stationary multivariate Gaussian random processes. These algorithms have simple electronic hardware and computer software implementations that will facilitate the laboratory evaluation and digital computer simulation of complex systems."
"This paper analyzes the threshold characteristic of FM signals. An exact solution, obtained previously [1] for Gaussian base-band modulation, is generalized in order to obtain the autocorrelation function of the output signal plus noise of an FM discriminator for the case of more general baseband signals. For an application of the general results, sinusoidal modulation is analyzed in detail. It is shown that, under appropriate conditions, the heuristic result obtained by Rice [3] for sinusoidal modulation can be derived from the exact solution that is obtained here."
"Given a probability space(\\Omega, S, \\mu);X_1, \\{ V_n \\}(n = 1, 2, \\cdots), K-component complex-valued random variables on(\\Omega, S, \\mu), Ka positive integer, whose components have finite variance and mean zero; and two sequences of matrices\\{ \\phi_n \\}, \\{ M_n \\}where the\\{ \\phi_n \\}areK \\times Kand the\\{M_n\\}areK_n \\times K, K_npositive integers, matrices whose elements are complex constants.

In Secion I we give definitions and some properties. In Section II, we give an answer in the special case where\\phi _n = \\phiandM_n = M(i.e., they are independent ofn). In Section III we prove a theorem that gives a deeper insight into the condition under which the theorem proved in Section II holds."
"A linear amplitude-continuous (LAC) block filter is a real-valued rectangular matrix transformationAof a vector of real-valued zero-mean signal samples with covariance matrixR_x, such thattr(A R_x A ^ T)is invariant withA. The matrixAadds redundancy to the signal by having more rows than columns. A special class of LAC filters, called orthogonal LAC filters, is constrained byA^T A \\propto I. For a channel containing zero-mean additive noise, independent of the signal, it is shown that optimum orthogonal LAC filters reduce error by diagonalizing the covariance matrices in the error expression, but are as ineffective as transmission without prefiltering against stationary white noise. On the other hand, this correspondence describes a class of LAC filters that are effective against stationary white noise."
"For the transmission of a Gaussian information source over an additive white Gaussian noise channel, several noiseless-feedback linear estimation schemes are shown to be the same in the sense that they not only achieve the rate-distortion bound on the minimum attainable mean-square error, but also possess identical system parameters. Moreover, Butman's noiseless-linear-feedback scheme for the transmission of a digital information source withMpossible messages over additive white Gaussian noise channels can, in fact, easily be obtained from any of these equivalent schemes by simply imposing a decision structure on it and by using the error probability criterion."
"Linear preemphasis and deemphasis filters are found for matching a class of colored Gaussian sources and wide-band additive white Gaussian-noise channels by the utilization of noiseless feedbacks. These filters are optimum in the sense that they give an overall mean-square error that corresponds to the rate-distortion bound."
"Given a channel and its input probability distribution, the fundamental lemma of Feinstein assures the existence of a code whose maximum error probability is bounded by a certain known constant. The lemma has been established for discrete-time channels and inputs that possess probability densities. We generalize the lemma for the case of continuous-time channels and inputs that do not possess probability densities."
"It is shown how the Karhunen-Loève(K-L)series representation for a finite sample of a discrete random sequence, stationary to the second order, may be further decomposed into a pair of series by utilizing certain symmetry properties of the covariance matrix of the sequence. The theory is applied to the particular example of a first-order Markov sequence, the series representation of which has not so far been reported in the literature. The generalization to the case of continuous random functions on a finite interval is similar and is therefore only briefly described."
"Results of research of irreversible losses and reversible variation of remanence in Alnico alloy magnets with temperature are presented. Temperature range was -180 to +550°C. Observed regularities are qualitatively explained."
"Two configurations of ripple filters, one passive and one active, used to filter the output ripple of dc-to-dc converters and other power supplies are discussed. The passive one uses a small-microfarad capacitor and a mutual inductor; the active one uses these same components and, in addition, an operational amplifier. These filters have potential for spacecraft applications to enable the designer to use more reliable types of capacitors such as ceramic or mica instead of tantalum capacitors now commonly used in the conventionalL-section or pure-capacitance filters requiring large-microfarad capacitance. The passive filter has achieved attenuation greater than 40 dB and the active filter greater than 50 dB. Both of these filters accomplished significant capacitance reduction when compared with anL-section filter for the same application."
"It is shown how the anisotropy correlation function, which largely determines linewidth and magnetic loss in poly-crystals, can be inferred from an analysis of micrograph pictures which show the grain boundaries at a polished surface. The second derivative of the correlation function is shown to be proportional to the cord-length distribution. At high-wave numbers the spectrum of the random anisotropy field is found to be inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wave number and the first power of the mean cord length. The relation between cord-length distribution and grain-diameter distribution is discussed."
"A magnetically tunable microwave filter structure is described using magnetodynamic modes in ferrite spheres. The tuning behavior and the loss properties are investigated. Advantageous tuning behavior is found in the unsaturated state of magnetization, where frequency shifts of 1.5GHz are obtained with tuning fields between 0 and 600Oe. To calculate the resonance frequency as a function of the tuning field, a first-order perturbation theory is developed, based on the variation of the magnetic-field energy stored in the ferrite. In the vicinity of the isotropic resonance frequency, good quantitative agreement between theory and measurements is obtained. Unloaded quality factors up to 20 000 at 3.5GHz are achieved with polycrystalline garnets. It is shown that the dielectric losses of the ferrite material mainly determine the losses of the filter device."
"The high Curie temperature region of the ternary system Li0.5Fe2.5O4-MnFe2O4- Mn3O4has been investigated. Toroidal cores were fired using the two-step firing technique, and nearly all compositions investigated produced squareScurves with thresholds between 4 and 10 Oe. When optimized for thresholds between 4 and 6 Oe, a compositional region was found, which combined good squareness and fast switching with low temperature and stress sensitivities. Substitutions of up to 0.1 atom of Zn for Mn in these compositions increased voltage outputs uV1and rV1without significantly affecting the other useful properties."
"An experimental and theoretical investigation has been made of the effect of finite flux rise time on transition length and delay time for thin recording media. This was done by tracing the field history of particles as they pass the write head and by assuming that the remanent magnetization of each particle depends on the maximum field it experienced. For linear rise times and for separation greater than half a gap width, analytic expressions have been derived showing the dependence of transition length and delay time on rise time and the other recording parameters. Numerical solutions valid for separations down to one quarter of a gap width and including exponential rise times are also shown."
"Mumetal strip samples exhibiting a high degree of preferred orientation after final heat treatment have been prepared by special processing. X-ray studies of these samples have revealed either a cube textured primary grain structure or a preferred secondary recrystallised grain structure dependent on the final heat treatment temperature. Whereas the permeability results for the cube textured samples were very poor, initial permeability values of up to 130 000 were obtained from the secondary re-crystallised material. Results for the same material showing little or no preferred orientation in the final strip are also given for comparison. The permeability results for the secondary recrystallised material were as good as or better than the randomly orientated material for a texture related to the primary cube texture matrix by a rotation of 30° about\\langle111\\rangle. The presence of a near cube secondary recrystallised texture resulted in a falling off in permeability giving lower results than for the random material."
"Domains and domain-wall motion in grain-oriented 50-percent Ni-Fe tapes were studied using a Kerr magnetooptical apparatus. The domain walls were quite straight under a slowly increasing field, and the nucleation of a reversed domain always occurred at either or both sides of the tapes. The 90° walls, such as those observed in a single crystal, often appeared even in the samples which were not strained to conserve the magnetization continuity. Under pulse fields the nucleation sites of reversed domains were distributed on the tape surface, and many isolated small domains appeared. It was found, however, that the domain configurations under the successive pulse field drive of much shorter length were similar to those under a slowly increasing field. Domain-wall velocities were measured for the samples of the thickness range from 25 μm to 81 μm, keeping the distance of wall displacement nearly constant by setting properly the pulse field amplitude and length. The measured dependence of the velocity on pulse field amplitude was not linear, and the mobilities increased with increasing field amplitude. This is discussed from the dynamic behavior of domain walls in tapes."
"The effect of directional order, formed by annealing in the demagnetized state, on the coercive force of ferromagnetic materials susceptible to magnetic anneal, is examined quantitatively. It is shown that in many magnetic materials, especially Fe-Ni alloys, this is the major source of coercivity. Experimental results are reported on the following alloys: Fe-6.4 percent Si with zero magnetostriction λ and large magnetocrystalline anisotropy constantK; 60 percent Ni-40 percent Fe with fairly large λ. and lowK; Mumetal (77.5 percent Ni-13.5 percent Fe-5 percent Cu-4 percent Mo) with nearly zero values of both λ andK. The coercive force increase resulting from the formation of a local induced anisotropy Ku, with the easy axis along the magnetization direction within each domain and domain wall, is found to vary linearly with the induced anisotropy fieldK_{u}/J_{s}, through a proportionality factor of the order of 0.1. This figure is shown to be in good agreement with the value predicted by the known theories which relate the coercive force to the fluctuation of the Bloch wall energy, when the contribution of an induced uniaxial term due to the formation of a random directional order is taken into account. Furthermore, in agreement with the fact that the viscosity field is also proportional to the anisotropy energy associated with directional orders a close proportionality is experimentally found to exist between the frozen-in viscosity field measured on a constricted loop and the increase of coercive force which is observed when the wasp-waisted shape of the loop is destroyed by demagnetizing the specimen. It is finally shown that materials characterized by directional anisotropy formation can show asymmetrical hysteresis loops, when properly annealed in a magnetic state corresponding to the vertex of a nonsaturated loop."
"Flexible ferrite keepers may show relatively high dielectric constants (\\varepsilon_{r} \\approx 10). In a magnetic thin-film memory, both permeability and permittivity are distributed discontinuously. The distribution affects the transmission and coupling properties of the drive lines. A simple model permits separate calculation of inductive and capacitive coupling between two parallel wires above ground. The keeper reduces the inductive and enhances the capacitive part of coupling. It depends on keeper properties and line spacing whether the resulting coupling is increased or decreased. Experiments confirmed the calculated predictions in general. With both wires and striplines, the keeper will increase coupling in most cases of practical interest. A good keeper should have a dielectric constant as low as possible. Among the samples investigated, those containing the Ni-Zn ferrite proved to be most suitable."
"Hoffmann's theory of ripple in ferromagnetic films is based on an approximate treatment of magnetostatic interactions; it thereby achieves analytical simplicity but introduces errors. The present paper investigates these errors under the following conditions: the equations can be linearized, the magnetization is constrained to lie in the film plane and to be constant through the thickness, and the stray field varies negligibly through the thickness. Only the effect of a concentrated force (the Green's function of the problem) is examined. Hoffmann's formula is regarded as an empirical modification of the known formula for negligible magnetostatic interactions, and his Cyis regarded as a parameter to be adjusted for \"best fit,\" according to some criterion, to the rigorous formula (a Fourier integral). Several criteria are examined; each is an integrated quantity that can be evaluated by Parseval's theorem. These lead to fairly consistent values of Cyand to a good fit as judged by the criterion. But as judged by the actual spatial variation of the magnetization, calculated to the first order in the magnetostatic interactions, the agreement is poor, especially at large distances, where a dipole-field behavior in the exact solution is replaced by an exponential decay in the Hoffman solution. Poor agreement is also found in the limiting case of very large magnetostatic interactions."

"Patterns of 5-μm-wide grooves on 25-μm centers were partially etched in the easy and/or hard directions in uniaxial Permalloy films; 20-μm-diameter circles or 25-μm centers were also etched. The easy direction grooves modified the anisotropy of the films to produce an NDRO behavior, while the hard direction grooves resulted in biaxial symmetry. Coercive force of the easy direction grooved films increased as a result of the lower energy of 180° walls in the thinner grooved regions. Pairs of crossties and the Bloch lines between them were confined to grooves in the hard direction. Creep sensitivity was markedly decreased in hard direction grooved films. This creep control probably results from the limitation of Bloch-line motion by the hard direction grooves, in agreement with several recent suggestions concerning the mechanism of creep in crosstie walls."
      "Over 400 cores of 1-mil 50-50 NiFe, each core containing 40 or more pounds of material, are used in a linear induction accelerator, which is a part of a controlled thermonuclear research experiment. Each core couples a constant voltage pulse of approximately 10kV lasting 350 ns to an electron beam whose current is in the hundreds of amperes range. To achieve reasonable operation of the accelerator it is essential that the drive power to the cores, both during the forward pulse and reset, be kept to a minimum. Since cores of this size and constant voltage drives of this magnitude are both rarities, potential manufacturers of these cores have been reluctant to guarantee the pulse performance. To overcome this reluctance a study program consisting of both a theoretical analysis and experimental tests was conducted. Specifically, the purpose of the study was to find answers to three key questions. 1) What is the minimum current required in an optimum core? 2) What are the major contributors to deviations from the minimum current? 3) What can be done to insure consistently good cores? Results of the study for cores made of both 1-mil and 1/2-mil tape are discussed; the major findings being that at these drive levels, eddy currents both within individual wraps and between wraps cause the dominant losses. Recently about 200 such cores were obtained. The measured pulse values are compared with the predicted values."
"The above resonance mode for obtaining and varying permeability in the VHF region is described. In this mode the bias field and RF magnetic field are orthogonal, and the ferrite core is always saturated or close to saturation. The bias field is larger than that required for ferromagnetic resonance. Eleven ferrites were evaluated with respect to operation in this mode. Tests included the determination ofQas a function of permeability, the temperature coefficient of permeability, and the effects of high RF flux densities on theQof the ferrite. Application in the above resonance mode results in considerably higher permeability andQvalues than the conventional approach at frequencies above 50 MHz. In addition, the RF power handling capabilities are substantially increased."
   "In commonly used inverters, the ac power is supplied to the load by the switching of gate-driven thyristors. The gating signals are supplied by an external triggering circuit. The inverter presented by the authors does not have a separate triggering circuit. The self-excited sinusoidal oscillations are obtained by using the capacitor voltage of the series ringing circuit as a gating signal. This type of inverter is very simple and useful if the load condition falls within the stable range of operation. The paper describes the circuit and it presents the analytical limits of stable operation. Experimental results are compared with analytical results."
   "This paper describes an analysis of a thyristor dc-to-dc converter employing self-commutating circuitry. Energy is transferred between the input and output terminals by means of resonant networks. Circuit techniques are described which reduce the acoustical noise and minimize the RF voltage spikes at the output terminal."
  "A technique is presented for the computation of magnetic fields in three-dimensional multicomponent systems containing highly nonlinear materials when under the influence of current-carrying conductors. The materials must be nonhysteretic. The technique is based upon the utilization of a computer to solve:H = H_{0} - \\int \\frac{\\nabla' \\cdot M'}{r^{2}} r^{0} d\\tau' + \\int \\frac{n' \\cdot M'}{r^{2}} r^{0} dS'. The computations yield such things as the internal distribution ofM, the externalHfields, the forces between various magnetic components, and the forces between any magnetic component and the current-carrying conductors. An application to a system consisting of a superconducting solenoid and a yoke for field shaping and shielding is discussed."
 "A new regulated rectifier which combines a ferroresonant regulator with a simple control circuit is described herein. The voltage regulating function normally provided in a ferroresonant regulator by the saturating core is provided by the control circuit in this new regulated rectifier. The control circuit provides regulation by varying the amplitude of the alternating voltage feeding the rectifier and filter. By incorporating feedback into the control circuit, regulation of better than ±1/2 percent for line, load, frequency, and temperature changes can easily be attained. The new feedback-controlled circuit retains many desirable properties of conventional ferroresonant regulators such as half-cycle transient response, good input power factor, ideal output waveform for rectification and filtering, high efficiency, short circuit protection, and suppression of input voltage spikes. Additional features are level set, improved efficiency, lower stray magnetic fields than observed with conventional ferroresonant regulators, and, primarily, precision regulation. Data on an 800-watt regulated rectifier employing the new circuit are also presented."
"A detailed experimental study of room-temperature magnetoelastic attenuation ofL-band longitudinal phonons in obliquely magnetized [100] YIG rods is presented. Magnetoelastic anisotropy, internal magnetic field inhomogeneity, and nonsaturation effects are evidenced. The experimental results obtained are interpreted on the basis of existing theories and proposed interaction models."
 "Dc chopper power converters are used to control the power supplied to a dc load from a dc source. In a battery-powered vehicle, for example, a dc chopper can control the dc series traction motor. Thyristors are favored for the switching element in high power applications. The particular circuit described here can be used as a voltage step-down converter or a voltage step-up converter and uses two auxiliary thyristors to turn off the main power thyristor. The behavior of the step-up circuit is described by exactly the same equations as the step-down circuit when the input voltage is replaced by the load voltage and the load current is replaced by the input current. The analysis treats the general case where saturating reactors are used to soften the commutation of current in the power semiconductors. The nonlinear characteristics of these reactors are approximated by two linear segments when molybdenum-Permalloy powder cores are used. Linear or square-loop cores are included by the theory as special cases. A design synthesis based on the analytical equations is best performed with the aid of a computer."
"A vapor deposition process was evaluated for encapsulating ferrite cores. The process consists of 1) subliming diparaxylylene, 2) pyrolysis of this dimer to form a monomer, paraxylylene, and 3) subsequent condensation of the monomer to form a polymer known as Parylene (Union Carbide Corporation). The process parameters and factors affecting thickness of the coating, the number of cores of varying size which may be processed per unit time, and the deposition rate of the parylene were evaluated. In addition, the degree of protection afforded by the polymer to insulative coated wire windings on the cores was evaluated."

"Magnetic shielding is interesting in static fields and in alternating fields up to circa 10kHz. Formulas of the shielding factors for single- and double-walled spherical and cylindrical shells are given, in the latter case also for fields longitudinal to the axes (double-walled shells only for static fields). For cylinders with open ends the shielding factors are represented up to 1kHz for transverse and up to 10kHz for longitudinal fields. In alternating fields interesting resonance effects are observed. Suggestions for practical application are given. Texture materials show an anomalous frequency characteristic of the shielding factor; different models for this effect are discussed. In one of these models the shielding factors of grids are treated."
 "In dc choppers and variable frequency inverters, the commutation of the conducting thyristors must be achieved. In most of the techniques used for commutation, the stored energy in the commutation capacitor at the end of the commutation is higher than the initial stored energy. This paper describes a commutation scheme which uses an energy recovery transformer to feed back the excess energy to the dc supply. The differential equations for the different modes of operation of the commutation system are derived. The solutions of the equations are used to optimize the system for minimum stored energy. Effects of the leakage inductance and turns ratio of the energy recovery transformer are also considered."
 "Conventional adhesive bonding caused reductions of 50 percent or more in the 100 gauss magnetic permeabilities (at frequencies of 60 to 5 × 105Hz) of laminated 4-79 molybdenum Permalloy cores. Oxidizing the laminations prior to adhesive bonding decreased these reductions as much as 50 percent. A method of stress-free joining was developed using simultaneous annealing and diffusion bonding of laminations which had been either pre-oxidized or coated with magnesium methoxide. Cores fabricated in this manner exhibited permeabilities similar to unbonded cores at low frequencies, and permeabilities higher than conventional adhesively bonded cores at high frequencies."
"A method is presented to permit the automatic testing of the inductance parameter of magnetic components. The system described provides automatic balancing of the resistive components of the appropriate branches of a Maxwell Bridge. The remainder of the bridge output signal is used to indicate whether the measured inductance is above or below the limit set by the standard arm of the bridge. The balancing is accomplished with a photoresistive feedback element coupling the bridge circuit to a feedback control circuit. This system has resulted in a 6:1 reduction of production line testing time for inductance of some steel core inductors."
   "Mössbauer measurements were carried out in compound BaMg2Fe16O27(Mg2W) by utilizing both polycrystalline and single-crystal samples. The resonant γ-absorption spectra have been measured with the absorbers at temperatures of 85 to 800°K and in some cases in the presence of a 15-kOe external magnetic field. The values of the hyperfine magnetic fields Hhfat the Fe57nuclei in the different sublattices as functions of temperature have been measured. By fitting the curve of the saturation magnetization σ versus temperature, the cation distribution over the available lattice sites has been deduced. From the value of σ extrapolated at 0°K, it turns out that the number of Bohr magnetons(n_{B})Wper elementary cell is higher than the value obtained by adding the corresponding values for theSandMstructures. The Curie temperature of the compounds has also been measured and is equal to (440 ± 5)°C."
"A method by which permanent-magnet eddy-current systems may be evaluated mathematically with computer assistance is presented, eliminating many of the factors normally used which require previous experience with similar designs or experimental evaluation. Design and analysis is performed in two stages: 1) the system external to the magnet terminals, and 2) the magnet form and internal operating conditions. Design procedure, compilation of data in required form, method of obtaining data for various expressions, and the sequence of calculation are described. Limits of accuracy for calculations are suggested."
"The method of voltage integration using expensive stabilized high-gain and low-drift amplifiers has been previously described. Many low-price general-purpose amplifiers are now available, and their performance as voltage integrators (fluxmeters) is reported. The fluxmeter is intended for general use in factory test rooms where measurements consist of a single flux change over a few seconds unlike recording hysteresigraphs, where integration may be over several minutes, and where output voltage drift problems may arise. These electronic fluxmeters offer advantages over the conventional moving coil fluxmeter in that zero return is very fast and that they are particularly suited to pass-fail testing when used in conjunction with a reference voltage source and a voltage comparator. Both a reference source and a comparator can be constructed using similar types of operational amplifiers."
"An oriented barium ferrite straight-field structure for focusing the electron beam of a klystron has been designed and successfully manufactured. The structure is a hollow tapered hexagon, circumscribed about a9\\frac{3}{4}-inch outside diameter and3\\frac{7}{8}-inch inside diameter. The overall height, including pole pieces, is9\\frac{3}{8}inches. The peak axial field strength, before field shaping, is 1000 gauss, and transverse fields are held to 1 percent or less of the shaped axial field. We believe it is the first time a structure of this kind has been successfully made in hard ferrite. The method of construction is economical and can be utilized to produce parts having an infinite variety of physical dimensions, as well as differing field strengths. The permanent-magnet portion is composed of a number of blocks which could be made from larger magnets, previously rejected for physical resaons. This eliminates the necessity for prohibitively expensive special dies. It also provides a commercial use for magnets that would otherwise be scrap. The magnet design calculation is a modification of the technique published by Dr. M. Glass of Bell Telephone Laboratories. Consideration is given to temperature effects. Field shaping is attained by use of mild-steel auxiliary parts."
"Ferrites and plastoferrites are being introduced into many applications like eddy-current instruments and others where temperature compensation is required. The temperature coefficient of ferrites is generally much greater than that of cast alloy materials, therefore the compensation with ferrite in general is more difficult. This paper deals with a theoretical investigation of the problem, gives a proposal for the solution, and reports different performances of the proposed system resulting from the degree of compensation used. Conclusions are given with the figures."
  "The magnetic properties of the hexagonal intermetallic compounds involving the rare-earth and3dtransition metals have been reported in the literature. These alloys look promising as fine-particle permanent magnets. A large number of samples in the system SmCo5-xCuxwere prepared by induction melting under a protective atmosphere, and annealed at various temperatures. An outstanding feature of these alloys is their high intrinsic coercive force. After annealing at low temperatures, they show coercive forces above 20 kOe and an energy product of about 8 × 106G.Oe. The most important factors determining the coercive force appear to be the chemical composition, the cooling rate, the alignment of the SmCO5-rich phase, and the annealing treatment. Examination by electron microscopy and electron probe techniques suggests a spinodal decomposition of a supersaturated solid solution into two phases, one rich in SmCo5and the other rich in SmCu5."
"For Alnico alloys containing 32-42 percent Co, 0-9 percent Ti, 6-8 percent Al, 14 percent Ni, 3 percent Cu, 0-0.5 percent S, 0-2 percent Nb, remainder Fe, the liquidus and solidus temperatures and the upper limit of the (α + γ) phase field were determined. The greatest influence is exerted by titanium in that all temperatures decrease as the Ti content increases. The influence of cobalt on temperature is considerably smaller, while sulfur has no influence at all. The addition of 2 percent Nb resulted only in the upper limit of the (α + γ) phase field being shifted to temperatures 20 to 30°C lower. Alnico alloys containing about 39 percent Co and 7-8 percent Ti were brought to columnar crystallization by controlled cooling, using a seed crystal. The seed contained 6 percent Ti and the lowering speed was between 0.50 and 3.75 cm/h. At a lowering speed of 0.50 cm/h and a temperature gradient of 5 to 10°C/mm, it was possible to obtain columnar crystallization without using a seed. The following magnetic values were obtained:(BH)_{\\max} = 11.0-11.7MG.Oe,BH_{c} = 1780-2100Oe,B_{r} = 8920-10 050gauss."
"This paper investigates the possibility of replacing the expensive rare-earth metals by the relatively inexpensive cerium mischmetal in rare-earth-cobalt permanent magnets. Using mischmetal, it is possible to obtain powders with coercivities as high as when pure cerium or lanthanum are used, although it is not possible to equal the values obtained with samarium. A compact with a density of 5.3 g.cm-3gives a(BH)_{\\max}of 3.1 MG.Oe, and if the special methods for obtaining high densities used by Buschow et al. or by Das were applied there seems no reason why values exceeding 10 MG-Oe should not be obtained. There are, however, some rather peculiar changes which occur in the compacts, especially when they are heated to about 150°C. It is not possible simply to replace cerium by mischmetal in the solid alloys of cobalt-cerium-copper described by Nesbitt as the response to heat treatment is quite different."
"The values of liquidus and solidus temperatures were measured for various permanent magnet alloys including Alcomax III and Hycomax II, III, and IV. The effect of sulfur on these temperatures was studied for each of the alloys, and the effect of tellurium on the temperatures for Hycomax IV was also studied. The effect of liquidus-solidus gaps on columnar crystal formation is discussed. An attempt is made to relate the values found to those obtained from equilibrium diagrams."
"The curves σ =f(T)are taken at a very high heating rate (1000°C/min) on samples of Alni, Alnico 5, and Alnico 8 alloys, heat treated so that their equilibrium state should correspond to a temperature of about 600°C and the α' phase particles should be much bigger than after a usual heat treatment. The Curie point occurs respectively at 760, 905, and 920°C. As we think we have avoided the diffusion process between α' and α phases, the Curie points should be those of the α' phase in almost optimal permanent magnet conditions. From that it is possible to argue that in the Alni alloy the α' phase is not pure Fe, but also includes Al and Ni; in Alnico 5 and Alnico 8 alloys, on the other hand, the ferromagnetic phase is not only Fe-Co, but also includes Al or Ni or both. In other curves taken at lower rates (300°C/min) on samples with normal morphology we observed a hysteresis of about 20-30°C between the Curie points during heating and cooling, which may be eventually ascribed to the gap between the solution and spinodal decomposition temperatures."
"The solid solution decomposition of Alnico 5 and Alnico 8 is studied by means of electron microscopy and X-rays. The following sequence of the decomposition process is found: Alnico 5: spherical zones-periodic modulated structure-rod-shaped particles of metastable tetragonal phases-final cubic phases; Alnico 8: the same sequence, but due to great importance of elastic energy at the decomposition, the three-dimensional modulated structure forms even during sharp quenching. The kinetics of modulated structure formation is studied. It is shown that the modulation wavelength increases according to a (time)nlaw. The activation energies of the decomposition process are determined. The spinodal mechanism of decomposition of the alloys in question is discussed."
"Some relationships between crystal textures and their permanent magnet properties are reviewed on the basis of a homogeneous uniaxial anisotropic ferromagnet and a mosaic grain agglomerate in the commercial size of an Alnico 8 alloy. From the results obtained, it has been concluded that the highest energy might be obtained by control of the following two factors (besides the ordinary ones of composition, casting, and heat treatment): 1) the mean deviation angle of crystal axis should be within 18° of the magnetization direction; 2) the crystal grain should be below 3 pcs/10 mm along the magnet length."
"Presents the back cover of the periodical issue."
"Mössbauer measurements have been carried out on Alnico 8 alloy after various heat treatments. The spectrum measured at room temperature (RT) of the sample heat treated for optimum permanent-magnet characteristics shows the presence of Fe in paramagnetic environment, with an average quadrupolar splitting Δ = 0.16 mm/s probably due to tetragonal distortion of the matrix. For the sample quenched and aged for 111 hours at 650°C the spectra measured at temperatures close to RT clearly show that the Curie point of the matrix is very near to RT. The obtained results allow us to interpret the behavior of saturation magnetization σ of the alloy as a function of the aging temperature. From Mössbauer measurements carried out on overaged samples the homogeneity characteristics of the phases are inferred."
"The main results obtained when studying a temperature dependence of the uniaxial anisotropy of oblique-incidence magnetic films of cobalt are given. It has been stated that when depositing the films onto a substratum heated to 350°C, the easy magnetization axis (EA) is perpendicular to the incidence plane of a molecular beam (a positive anisotropy). EA is in the incidence plane (a negative anisotropy) when the temperature of a substratum is 60 to 80°C. At intermediate temperatures of a substratum a positive anisotropy arises at small angles of deposition and a negative one is at great angles of deposition. Temperature dependences of the constant of the uniaxial anisotropy for samples with a positive or negative anisotropy distinguish between each other. In samples with a positive anisotropy this constant changes with the temperature as a square of magnetization; in samples with a negative anisotropy at less than room temperatures, this constant is approximately proportional to the anisotropy constant of a massive-cobalt single crystal. The obtained results have been considered from the theoretical point of view, and it has been concluded that a negative anisotropy in oblique-incidence films arises as a result of formation of very small grains stretching in the direction of the incidence plane and having a significant anisotropy of the magnetic energy in layers adjoining the boundaries (the Néel anisotropy). Observation of the typical temperature dependence of the anisotropy constant of these samples is a very convincing proof of existence of the Néel anisotropy."
"Magnetization curves and hysteresis loops of anisotropic hard ferrites were analyzed after the specimens had been demagnetized either thermally or by an ac field parallel or perpendicular to the preferred axis (PA) between -196°C and Curie temperature, or by a dc field. Each demagnetization yields a specific magnetization curve; below saturation fields, asymmetrically positioned and noncentrosymmetrical loops develop, except after ac demagnetization at 20°C (=measuring temperature) parallel to PA. This is due to domain configurations differently arranged and of different stability. The asymmetry is caused by \"frozen\" unstable configurations, which undergo an irreversible change due to the action of the field. Therefore, with reversed field not all of the previous possibilities for remagnetization are still available."
"The magnetic stiffness of polycrystalline isotropic barium ferrite has been measured in the region of negative field strength. It is found that the Stoner-Wohlfarth model describes magnetic reversal only for small field strength. Irreversible magnetization processes known from magnetization measurements have strong influence on the field dependence of the magnetic stiffness. The domain splitting of \"90° crystallites\" which was found in previous investigations proves to be essentially independent of the magnetic history of the sample."
"The process of magnetization reversal in ferromagnets with uniaxial crystal anisotropy is discussed. It is shown that the \"critical-size concept\" has no relevance to coercivity. Critical fields are distinguished as nucleation fields and propagation, or pinning, fields. The pinning of walls is discussed and illustrated by experiments on various substances. Intrinsic pinning in highly anisotropic materials is predicted."
"The prospect that permanent magnets with previously unattainable coercivities and energy products might be made from cobalt-rare earth alloys has caused intense research efforts in the last three years. Alternative ways of preparing magnets from powders and by casting were demonstrated in several laboratories.(BH)_{\\max} \\approx 20MG.Oe andMH_{c} > 25 000Oe have been achieved with SmCo5, and the development of manufacturing processes for magnets made from this alloy has begun. This paper reviews the basic concepts, properties of the alloys of interest, and the physical factors influencing the coercive force. Approaches to alloy, powder, and magnet fabrication are discussed, with their merits and drawbacks; also problems incurred in the materials development and their possible solutions. Application areas are reviewed and some economic factors considered. It is concluded that theRCo5magnets are indeed beginning to live up to their promise, but that more materials research, process development, and circuit redesign are needed if their potential is to be fully utilized."
"A technique has been developed for extracting one of the phases present in Ni-Co-Al-Ti-Cu-Fe permanent magnet alloys heat-treated to give optimum magnetic properties. Examination of such extracts by electron microscopy and electron-probe microanalysis has confirmed previously held theories that the precipitate is strongly magnetic (50 percent Fe and 50 percent Co) in a virtually nonmagnetic matrix. The results show that for permanent magnets containing 5-percent Ti the matrix has the same structure (L2_{1}) as a range of materials known as Heusler alloys."
"The results of an investigation of the magnetic properties of the α' and α phases in Alnico 8 and Alnico 5 alloys are presented. The influence on the alloy magnetic characteristics of changing these properties during the process of heat treatment is discussed."
 "The thermal aftereffect is proportional to the irreversible susceptibility\\chi irrand thus has a peak value in the zone of coercive force. It follows a logarithmic time law of the type\\Delta I= S \\cdot \\log t + constwhose constantSshows a linear increase with the absolute temperatureT. The quotientS/\\chi irris a material constant and proportional to the coercive force. Natural aging also follows a law of the form\\Delta B = S \\cdot \\log t + const, but is not proportional to\\chi irrand therefore does not have a peak value in the zone of coercive force. Natural aging disappears at the remanence and at the coercive force. The constantSof natural aging is proportional to the productI \\cdot H \\cdot \\chi irrand inversely proportional to the coercive force. The quotientS/\\chi irris, in this case, not a material constant and not proportional to the coercive force."

"A theoretical analysis of elastic and surface energy of a cubic solid solution which disintegrates into two isomorphic cubic phases has been carried out. It is shown that in such a solution the formation of periodically distributed thin plate inclusions is energetically advantageous."
"The contribution of each part of the flow to a meter signal is expressed in terms of a weight vectorWand the velocity ν, with the signal\\propto \\int \\nu \\cdot W drover the flowmeter volume.Wdepends on the magnetic fieldBand a vector defined entirely by the electrode and flowmeter geometry. A meter is called \"ideal\" if the signal is proportional to the flow rate and independent of the flow pattern. The condition onWfor this is given and an experimental ideal meter mentioned. Since meters with small (point) electrodes cannot be ideal, weaker conditions onWfor flows of different types are reviewed. A technique for designing short meters suitable for rectilinear flow with an unknown axisymmetric velocity profile is briefly described. The behavior of different shapes of electrodes, including electrodes of finite and variable conductivity, is discussed. Finally the problems of pulsating flow, magnetic field specification, and nonuniform and anisotropic blood conductivity are discussed."
     "The formulas usually employed to describe the forces acting during eddy-current braking contain only one numerical value for magnetic-field strength at the site of the eddy-current disk, namely, its maximum or average value above the magnetic poles. The author investigates the influence of different magnetic-field profiles at the site of the eddy-current disk on braking force. For this purpose a number of magnetic systems using barium-ferrite magnets, which supplied different magnetic fields in the eddy-current disk, were developed. These fields varied from a nearly straightforward sinusoidal shape to fields which existed practically only at the poles, beyond which they dropped very steeply. The braking forces measured at these systems are compared with calculated braking forces. In the calculations a formula which establishes a relationship between the measured magnetic-field profile and the braking force is used. The formula was developed for a rectangular, a cosine and a cosine-squared distribution of magnetic-field strength perpendicular to the measured magnetic-field profile, allowing for the boundary conditions prevailing at the edge of the eddy-current disk."
"In an attempt to avoid the undesirable aspects of galvanic nerve stimulation, a toroidal inductive transducer was developed and tested. It was found that a nerve threading the lumen of the toroid could be stimulated by a magnetic field which generated an EMF of 0.7-volts peak amplitude and 50-μs duration in a monitor wire. The stimulation was sufficient to cause contraction of major leg muscles in anesthetised mammals. Some earlier indication that a similar arrangement would allow detection of compound action potentials from nerve has not yet been verified by subsequent experiments. The method and its relation to established theory and procedure is described. An example of a stimulus-pulse generator is given. Possible applications and future plans of study are discussed."
"In the small permanent-magnet direct current (dc) motor, the coupling between magnet and armature during start and stall has great influence on the motor's size, cost, efficiency, and operating parameters. The interaction between armature and permanent magnet field arrangements is analyzed. Attention is focused on conditions which allow high-induction relatively low-coercive-force permanent magnets to be used to good advantage. The consequences of relatively high levels of armature flux and low levels of armature reaction are analyzed in terms of armature conductors, armature resistance, copper volume, and total motor volume. The analysis also contrasts the described approach with the widely used lower induction level ceramic magnets which are able to withstand very high levels of armature reaction."
    "The magnetocardiogram results from the detection of magnetic fields generated outside the body by electric current sources in the heart.

           "The development of a magnetic core antenna is described, and the results received from animal and human tests are given. In addition to the operative method of implantation, the advantage of using this sort of control system for orthopedic aids is discussed."
  "Numerical methods to calculate two- or three-dimensional static magnetic fields in devices with air, iron, currents, and permanent magnets are described and applied to loudspeaker magnets and dc motors with permanent excitation."
"The temperature dependence of the domain structure of single crystals of uniaxial ferrimagnetic oxides with high-anisotropy field in the SrO(6 - x)Fe2O3xAl2O3compositional series, withx = 1.8and 2.4, was investigated. The domain configurations of thermally and/or ac field demagnetized states and the changes in dc and ac fields were observed by means of the colloid technique using a suspension in paraffine oil. The temperature dependence of the wall energy density between room temperature and the Curie point (270°C) of the compound withx = 1.8was computed using the temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization and the domain width for the Kittel-like domain structure. It has been found that the room temperature domain structure of the compound withx = 2.4depends upon the mode of demagnetization, i.e., thermally or in the ac field. The ac demagnetized states are more stable than the thermally demagnetized ones. The samples exhibit a room temperature memory of the previous magnetization, which decreases with rising temperature. This memory is completely lost after heating at 400°C. The peculiarities of the temperature dependence of the domain structure and magnetic behavior on thermal cycling are explained by considering the existence of magnetic inhomogeneities within the crystal."
      "For long time application of myoelectric signal read-out (e.g, for patients with controllable limb prothesis), a method, which avoids either the disadvantages of skin surface electrodes or the percutaneous galvanic conductors, is described. The myoelectric energy is inductively coupled out through the skin without amplification or any implanted energy source (or energy coupled or radiated into the body from an extracorporeal source). The electrodes are placed directly at or inside the muscle which generates the wanted signals and are connected by means of two ductile wires to the coil fixed subcutaneously. Achieved advantages are: good separation of signals originating from different muscles, improvement in the delivery of signals for a proportional control (to muscle activity) of, e.g., artificial limbs, and high probability of a good long time reliability because of the technical simplicity."
 "An improved method for measuring uncertainties in the magnetization process in the saturation region is described. Preliminary results indicate that uncertainties occur in Permalloy tapes for magnetic intensities as high as 30 times the coercive force. Above this intensity, the discontinuities rapidly disappear, indicating that fields of this magnitude are required for complete saturation. No uncertainties are observed in the saturation region during demagnetization."
 "Ultrasound magnetostrictively stimulates vibrations of Bloch walls and periodic rotations of the magnetic moments of the domains. If the stress amplitudes are small the domain configuration remains unaltered. When compared with the measured reversible susceptibility, measurements of the attenuation and the velocity of sound as functions of magnetization provide information about some aspects such as domain width and the occurrence of different elementary processes during magnetization. Using sound waves with propagation direction normal to the external magnetic field, one gets as a new variable the angle between the field and the oscillation direction. The results of these measurements cannot be discussed without contradicting classical ideas concerning te magnetostrictive excitation process."
"Subsidiary-resonance phenomena in single-crystal Mn-ZnY have been theoretically and experimentally investigated. Using the general expression for the first-order instability, the threshold fields have been calculated for material parameters (anisotropy field, saturation magnetization) appropriate to Mn-ZnY. Good agreement is shown between experimental data and theoretical predictions."
"Magnetostatically coupled films with an internal conductor were studied using a dual-beam Kerr apparatus which enabled the magnetization of both the top and the bottom films of the structure to be monitored. The easy- and hard-axis components of the magnetizations were recorded in succession with sampling techniques during the switching processes, and the traces were combined to provide trajectories ofMthroughout the switching. In the case of easy-axis coupled films, certain trajectories lead to a stable multidomain state (locking); a new technique using current pulses through the Ag conductors in conjunction with an externally applied variable hard-axis field provides a quick method of determining the locus of applied fields for which locking occurs. The locked-state trajectories and complete-switching trajectories are found to be composed of three regions of switching: 1) a coherent rotation of the magnetization, 2) an incoherent rotation, and 3) wall motion. From the data used to construct the trajectories, the times to reach a locked state and the durations of each different switching mechanism is determined."
"A review of various types of fluxgate sensors is given and they are divided into two major groups, parallel-and orthogonal-gated fluxgates. A theory for parallel and for orthogonal gating is presented and the gating characteristics for the two cases are calculated from measuredB-Hcurves. The theory is verified by a close fit to the experimentally derived curves and finally a general expression for the output voltage from the two types of fluxgates is presented."
"Nanosecond switching in thin magnetic films is studied by the application of easy-axis pulses with rise times from 0.4 ns to 50 ns. Switching time data with selected hard-axis bias fields and with the rise time as a parameter are presented. The switching mechanism depends on the percentage of flux switched during the ramp portion of the pulse. A comparison between the experimental data and numerical solutions based on the rotational model and the corresponding transverse signals shows that for pulses with amplitudes larger than the experimental astroid values (coherent rotation with 0.4 ns pulses) but with rates of increaseS < 10^{9}Oe/s, the stray field interaction between partially switched and unswitched regions causes appreciable flux to switch incoherently."
"The linear relationships of speed, current, and torque in a motor with permanent magnet stator imply no change in armature flux over the test range. On this basis the torque per unit volume of magnet material at a specified fraction of the theoretical no-load speed can be expressed in terms of machine dimensions, conductor resistivity, and the square of mean air gap flux density.B_{g}^{2}is shown to be proportional to the no-load energy density in the stabilized magnetB_{m}H_{m}. Stabilization is normally obtained from the armature reaction at stall but its effective value is only a small fractioneof the total armature magnetomotive force. The relationships derived are used first, to examine theB_{m}H_{m}product values theoretically obtainable from three different magnet materials, and second, to obtain some experimental values ofewhich are in the range 0.01-0.1."
  "Voltage-to-frequency converters with electronic counters are ideal integrators and can be used as fluxmeters for magnetic measurements if the velocity of the flux changes is controlled electronically in order to achieve a nearly constant induced voltage. The field strength is measured by means of Hall probes with a printing sample-and-Hold digital voltmeter which receives its commands by a preset counter after preselected constant flux intervals. For evaluation, all data in binary code may be fed directly into an on-line computer."
"The structure of the Ticonal-type alloys was investigated using a transmission electron microscope technique. Two-dimensional square macrolattice was observed in the section normal to the magnetic field which was applied at heat treatment. The translation vectors of that lattice coincide with the\\langle100\\rangledirections of the crystal lattice. There were equiaxed regions of various contrasts at the corners and center of the unit cell and flat intermediate layers on the sides. Thus the two-phase model of the structure is only an approximation. The prolonged tempering at high temperature (800°C, 20 hours) of specimens after they are subjected to the thermal magnetic treatment gives rise to the development of the complex modulated structure."
"Some results of an exploration of the relation of crystallographic structural perfection of Alnico single crystals and their magnetic properties are presented. Chemical and physical heterogeneity of the single crystal structure is shown to increase with transition from Alnico 5 to Alnico VS55. Increase of the temperature gradient in the melt and the drawing rate contributes to increasing the structural perfection of single crystals, and their magnetic properties."
"A true integrating electronic fluxmeter with digital readout has been developed. It is a solid-state device, stable over a wide range of environments, and is free of zeroing and vibration problems. When measuring flux, using a search coil, the traditional integration ofN \\phi = 10^{8} \\int e dtis here performed by a voltage-to-frequency converter (VFC) which produces a series of output pulses, the number of which is proportional to\\int e dt. These pulses are summed on a digital counter, and the indication thus obtained is a measure of the flux change. Calibration is readily performed by direct reference to the basic standards of the volt and the second, an important feature of this fluxmeter. This is in contrast to the generally used secondary standards of mutual inductance and current shunt millivolt drop. Enhancing this direct traceability is the constant digital readout, eliminating reading errors caused by a moving light beam. The basic accuracy of integration can be 0.15 percent or less."
"Conditions for obtaining single crystals of the Alnico 5 alloy by using the method of recrystallization are described. The process of recrystallization was metallographically analyzed, and a conclusion on the role of the γ phase participating in it was made. The conditions for obtaining orientated single crystals were determined, and the role of cycle heat treatment in the growth process was defined. The properties of single crystals obtained after heat treatment in a magnetic field are given."
"Experiences of the past decade in developing and utilizing Fe-Co fine-particle magnets are described. A brief review of theoretical considerations involved and the extent to which theoretical promise has been realized in a commercial process is discussed. The wide range of unit magnetic properties obtained by spacing and ordering the fine-particle building blocks are given. Cold pressing and extrusion-forming techniques have contributed to the many combinations of mechanical and magnetic property variation available. Some of the unique experiences in utilizing fine-particle magnets in magnetic circuits and devices are described. The close magnetic and physical tolerances of fine-particle magnets have had an important impact on the small electromechanical device area. Specific examples of unique designs are described in terms of a small dc motor, a core meter, a hearing aid, and the reed switches."
"Anisotropy constants and rotational hysteresis have been investigated at different stages of optimal heat treatment on 8-mm-diameter spherical samples. The changes in the uniaxial anisotropy constant obtained upon tempering are in good agreement with the respective changes in coercive force. Rotational hysteresis has been measured in the range from 400 to 28 800 Oe. Two maxima have been obtained on the curves of the rotational hysteresis versus field after all heat treatments. The first maximum is interpreted in terms of reversal magnetization of single-domain precipitates in a low magnetic matrix. The nature of the second maximum is not clear."
"External elastic stress applied during the precipitation process of Fe-Ni-Al alloys influences the orientation of elongated precipitates. Compression of the crystal along the\\langle 100 \\rangleaxis makes the orientation of elongated precipitates to this direction unfavorable. When compressive stress is applied along the\\langle 110 \\rangleaxis, the rod-like precipitates are oriented mostly to\\langle 100 \\rangleaxis which is perpendicular to the direction of compression. Uniaxial magnetic anisotropy induced during the thermomechanical treatment (cooling under stress) causes a considerable increase of permanent magnetic properties in comparison with those obtained without stress. The energy productBH_{\\max} = 2.1 \\times 10^{6}G.Oe is obtained on a single crystal of alloy free from cobalt."
   "Some aspects of the alternating and rotational hysteresis losses of very diluted samples of γ-Fe2O3particles are examined. The packing fractionpof the particles ranges from 0.001 to 0.120. The coercive force is found to be independent ofp. The alternating and rotational hysteresis losses appear dependent uponpforp < 0.04; the rotational losses increase considerably aspapproaches zero. The values of the rotational hysteresis integral are close to the theoretical ones corresponding to the model of magnetization reversal of chain of spheres with fanning, but they increase slightly with decreasingpforp < 0.04. Generally, the ratio of rotational to alternating losses is about twice that for bulk materials. All these effects are ascribed to a weakening of the magnetic interactions among particles."
"Mössbauer spectroscopy and X-ray studies have been used to investigate two Alnico 8 alloys in different stages of a thermomagnetic treatment cycle. It is revealed that the first low-temperature aging subsequent to magnetic field hardening results in redistribution of components among the alloy phases, while the second low-temperature aging causes the variation in the degree of weak magnetic phase order. The temperature range of developing effective magnetic fields on iron nuclei in the α phase is shown to lower with an increase in the degree of Fe3Al-type order."
"The biological effects of radiation including the possible effects due to various gravitational states on developing organisms and their interaction with radiation effects is investigated. Certain aspects of the authors' own work along with a review of the observed effects of magnetic fields reported by others is also included. On the basis of these data, it is possible to speculate both on the association of magnetic field phenomena to the understanding of physiologic processes and on the possible deleterious effects these phenomena may have on the biological system."
 "The main properties of the rare earth elements are discussed, emphasizing their magnetic properties. However, it is difficult to use these elements in practice, because their Curie points are located below room temperature. In order to take advantage of the properties of these substances, they can be alloyed with iron, cobalt, or nickel. The properties of the rare earth-cobalt alloys are discussed, the phase diagram and the crystal structures are described, and the ferrimagnetic behavior is explained. Alloys of interest for magnet applications are selected."
"High-coercivity alloys with higher Co (24-58.7 wt %) and Ti (up to 16.4 wt %) contents were investigated. Information was obtained on the combined effect of the Co and Ti on the dendritic segregation, the temperature of the solid solution treatment, the start-off temperature of the high-coercivity\\alpha_{2} \\rightarrow \\alpha_{1}+\\alpha_{2}decomposition, and the magnetic properties of the alloys after optimum isothermal magnetic treatment (ITMT). The conditions of the ITMT and multistage tempering were investigated. The typical feature of all the alloys is a strong dependence of the magnetic properties upon the ITMT temperature, which should be held to an accuracy of\\pm5\\degC. The high coercive forceBH_{c} = 2000-2200Oe and maximum energy product(BH)_{\\max} = 4.5-5.5MG.Oe have been obtained on the alloys with 38 percent Co and 8-8.5 percent Ti as a result of the strict observance of ITMT and tempering conditions."
 "Electromagnetic catheter blood-flow meters in current use can be considered to be modifications and adaptations of electro-magnetic velometers developed in 1944 for local flow velocity studies in physical systems. Availability of materials like Teflon and polyethylene which can be introduced into the blood stream without causing rapid clotting stimulated development of intravascular flow sensors in competition with extravascular electro-magnetic flow meters. The intravascular flow meters can be subdivided into two classes: 1) external-field flow meters, where the magnet is external to the animal or patient, and where only the electrodes are introduced into the blood vessel, and 2) \"self-contained\" flow meters, where the magnet is introduced into the blood stream together with appropriately disposed electrodes. The intravascular devices may be either velometers, which measure the local velocity of flow in a blood vessel, or volume rate of flow meters. In one type of velometer the conventional scheme is turned inside out. The flow being measured passes around the flow sensor rather than through it. Either the magnetic field may be derived from a flat coreless coil, or the radial component of a field generated by a cylindrical iron-core magnet may be used with adjacent electrodes separated by a septum. The conventional scheme of passing the flow through the transducer lumen may also be used in catheter flow meters. Instruments of this type can be classified as I) transverse-flow catheter flow meters, or 2) longitudinal flow sensors. In type 1) catheters, the flow-sensing element incorporated into the catheter has a lumen whose cylinder axis is perpendicular to the catheter axis. They are thus sensitive to flows which are at right angles to the catheter axis. In type 2) catheters, the lumen is coaxial with the catheter so that flows parallel to the catheter axis are measured at the location of the sensor. Both types of catheters may be either used as volume rate of flow meters, by placement against the ostium of an artery so that all of the flow entering it must first pass through the flow sensor, or used as velometers, by placing the flow sensor into the lumen of a major blood vessel with the lumen axis of the transducer parallel to the blood vessel axis. Some designs do not have provisions for centering and angular alignment of the velometer in the blood vessel, while others do. In addition to the magnetic field of a flat coil and a substantially radial magnetic field, the field between two parallel wires carrying opposite currents can be used to generate the intravascular magnetic field. This configuration permits the design of a collapsible flow sensor which can be passed through a narrow tube (such as a needle or catheter passed through the skin and underlying tissues into an artery), and which will expand in the artery to touch diametrically opposed points of its wall. This flow sensor also serves as an artery gage, giving its diameter through radiography. This knowledge permits calculation of the volume rate of flow after establishment of the average flow velocity by velometry. The greatest degree of miniaturization of intravascular flow sensors is achieved through the use of an external magnetic field. Only little more than electrodes and their lead wires need be incorporated into the catheter; it can thus be small enough in diameter to pass through a French-5 catheter which can be used for percutaneous introduction of the flow sensor into the vascular tree."
 "Resonance isolators operating atX-band frequencies have been constructed in conventional 50-ohm microstripline by positioning ferrite strips on the surface of the alumina substrate adjacent to the stripline conductor. A transverse external magnetic field is applied in the plane of the surface to obtain the necessary Kittel resonance condition. It is shown that by suitable choice of ferrite dimensions the performance may be optimized to give a forward loss of 0.5 dB together with a reverse loss in excess of 30 dB at resonance. The influence of saturation magnetization of the ferrite as well as relative permittivity of the substrate material has also been examined. Nonreciprocal phase shift may be obtained by using this geometry; but high external field is required to saturate the ferrite. A modification employing an all-ferrite substrate, which may be used to design a phase shifter operated at remanence, is described."
        "Oriented Si steel containing up to 6 percent Si was produced by gaseous siliconizing of oriented 3.25-percent Si steel strip. Dc magnetization curves in the with-grain (rolling) direction and ac core loss and magnetostriction measurements in both the with- and cross-grain (transverse) directions were obtained before and after magnetic annealing. Domain structures were photographed before and after the magnetic annealing treatments. Compared to the 3.25-percent Si starting material, the high Si strip exhibited improved dc permeability up to the knee of the magnetization curve, decreased losses, and decreased magnetostriction. The effects were approximately linear with increasing Si content and could be attributed to general magnetic softening. Magnetic annealing improved the properties further. When applied in the with-grain direction, the magnetic anneal led to a cleaner antiparallel domain structure; in the cross-grain direction, magnetic annealing established a completely transverse domain structure. These domain structure changes adequately accounted for the property improvements obtained from magnetic annealing."
"Aging properties of the plated wire stabilized by on-line flash annealing for 6 seconds were investigated and a sufficient stabilizing effect has been obtained. The wire has a multilayer construction including three Permalloy layers and two Ni-Co hard layers, and has good nondestructive readout (NDRO) properties, Aging was accelerated by dc and pulsed hard-axis fields at temperatures between 50°C and 150°C. The largest change has been found inI_{d2}which is the upper limit of the digit current margin. Provided that lifetime is the time required for the 10-percentI_{d2}degradation, a typical wire has a lifetime of 100 years under the dc hard-axis field at 40°C. According to the extrapolation from the lifetime distribution of the wires, the first failure bit in a million bits operating under de field at 40°C is predicted after 20 years. Since in actual memory devices the wires are driven by a word pulse field instead of a dc field, much longer time will be required before the first failure."
"Certain thin Permalloy films which have a basically uniaxial character show square hysteresis loops in both easy and hard direction. The hard-direction coercivityH_{c2}is about half that of the easy direction. If a saturating magnetic field is applied at an angle α, a few degrees from the hard direction, a loop typical of uniaxial films results. Application of a small bias field normal to the drive field results in a triangular loop. This has two stable remanent states, in the first of which the magnetization has been left in a hard-direction low-permeability zero state. The other remanent state has the magnetization in a high permeability, easy direction, the one state. Whether the interrogating pulses of magnitude less thanH_{c2}will result in an output pulse or not depends on the state of the device. No destruction of the stored information occurs. It is possible to write into either state by using the coincident current techniques, as long as precautions are taken against creep from the hard direction."
"Measurements are made of the temperature dependence of the coercive field Hcof Fe-Cu alloys with up to 3 percent Cu and of Fe-3.25-percent Si alloy specimens in undeformed state and various degrees of plastic deformation. The coercive field Hcof the deformed specimens increases to a maximum with rising temperature up to about 500°C and then drops steeply at the approach of the Curie temperature. The coercive field of the Fe-Cu and the undeformed Fe- 3.25-percent Si alloy specimens drops steadily with rising temperature. The results are discussed in the light of the theoretical statements available in the literature. TheH_{c}-Tbehavior of the deformed specimens indicates that the change in magnetization takes place by Bloch wall movement up to about 500°C and by rotational processes above this temperature. The temperature dependence of the coercive field in the undeformed specimens is determined by the interaction of Bloch wall movement with the nonmagnetic inclusions."
"Studies on 2-and 3-mm ferrite cores for use as storage elements in an analog core memory are presented. The information is stored as the flux level of the magnetic core. The partial fluxswitching is performed by voltage pulses with constant amplitude but varying length. Between writing and reading an error appears which is caused by the reversible portion of the flux and whose value depends upon the switched flux level. It is shown that there exists a relation between the magnitude of the error and the characteristic properties of the cores. The measured character of the error depends on how often a particular write-read cycle is repeated before changing the amplitude of the switched flux. A history effect was found to be the reason for this. A special method has been developed to drive the cores in a matrix array [1]. In this mode the history effect did not occur."
"Ferrofluids are colloidal dispersions of subdomain magnetic partiles (\\bar{D}< 150Å) that retain their liquid characteristics in the presence of a magnetic field. As a result, ferrofluids are unique liquid media in which it is possible to induce substantial magnetic forces which result in unusual fluid mechanical properties in the presence of an applied field. Magnetic properties may be conferred to a wide range of liquid such as hydrocarbons, water, glycerol, silicones, and even fluorocarbons. The magnetic properties of the ferrofluids can be controlled by varying the composition, size, and concentration of the magnetic particles. The existence of these magnetic fluids has resulted in a number of unique applications. Applications which have been reduced to practice include novel pumps and other energy conversion devices, viscous dampers for gravity gradient satellites, accelerometers, and gyroscope supports employing levitation bearings, specific gravity meters, seals, etc."
"A model is developed for the dynamic operation of magnetic reed relays. From experimental data, it is found that the processes of dynamic magnetization and mechanical motion can be treated as separate and consecutive in time. Remarkable agreement was found between the experimentally determined static magnetic force and a force calculation based on an assumed domain structure inside the reed tips. The model basically assumes that the flux passes through the air gap in two areas near the tips of the reeds, each area equals half the cross-sectional area of the reed. The dynamic magnetization process is modeled with an improved version of Agarwal's [7] model for eddy-current losses in laminations, and a differential equation for dynamic reed motion is derived. The very good agreement between theoretical and experimental results shows that this model gives a good representation of the dynamics of the system. Furthermore, the findings of the static force model based on domain concepts have basic application to the knowledge of magnetics in addition to the application here to reed relays."
"Magnetostrictively induced elastic resonance (MER) of a ferrite core serves as a technique for characterizing the core in the environment of the plane assembly and differentiating core anomalies from wiring induced anomalies not discernable by pulse techniques alone. The shifts of the resonant frequencies as a result of the change in a core from a constrained to an unconstrained mechanical state explains the ability of the MER technique to discriminate unambiguously between damaged and undamaged cores."
"In an effort to arrive at highly reliable ferrite core storages of low weight, small dimensions, and high mechanical strength under dynamic loads, a new technique has been developed for the manufacture of the so-called Stapelblock. In contrast to conventional designs, the matrix planes are glued one on top of the other and the whole stack is attached to a single common base plate. This solidly bonded sandwich is an extremely compact unit of high inherent mechanical stability. Each matrix plane consists of a thin plate to which the cores are bonded elastically. Those drive wires which link all planes are threaded-in during the manufacturing process as single lengths of wire. It has, therefore, been possible to eliminate the frames usually required for accommodating the wire terminals as well as all internal matrix connections."
"Physical processes in a laminated ferrite wafer (LFW) storage element are considered. A mathematical technique for calculating the flux reversal processes of the storage element is proposed. The technique makes it possible to evaluate the effect of the address write current on the output signal quantitatively. The problem of the digit current influence on the storage element performance is considered. The threshold value of this current is shown to be determined by the coercitive force of the ferrite times the cross-section perimeter of the digit line."

   "Evaporation, electroplating, and etching were used to develop high-density, high-speed, and low-cost fine striped memory (FSM) which is a planar film memory with completely closed digit line flux paths. The results of three important experiments on FSM and its development, structure, and production are described. Three conclusions have been obtained from the experiments. First, a 300-Åthick evaporated Permalloy undercoating is needed to improve the magnetic properties of the electroplated Permalloy. Second, a completely closed flux path assures full output and operating stability. Third, a flux keeper, which is applied to memory strips, and for which embedded word lines are apart from the strips, assures high signal-to-noise ratio and low driving current. An effective flux keeper has been used to make a high-density (5000 bit/cm2) memory."
"This paper describes some of the structure-property relations for Co and CoNi films containing Group VIB additions, i.e., chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten and Group VA additions, i.e., phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. All films were prepared by electrodeposition. The magnetic properties and metallurgical structure of the films with tungsten cover the same range of parameters as produced with the phosphorus films. The quantity of the elements required to achieve the maximum in coercive force increases substantially in the sequence P, As, Sb, and Bi; and in the sequence W, Mo, and Cr. The saturation moment and coercive force both decrease with increase of the concentration of added element required to attain the maximum coercive force. The quantity of the elements required is believed to be related to the ability of the electrolyte to produce a refinement of the grain size of the deposit, and the ability of the element added to segregate to the grain boundaries. The saturation moments of Co with W and P agree with the results expected for solid solutions except at high concentrations. The structure sensitive magnetic properties obtained with CoNiW films are qualitatively interpreted in the same way as for the CoNiP films, i.e., on the basis of a strongly interacting array of fine particles. The alloys containing Cr, Mo, or W possess improved resistance to aging at elevated temperatures and in corrosive environments."
"Flexible magnetically guided catheters are subjected to three different forces: mechanical forces transmitted along the tubing from its proximal end, those imparted by the action of external fields acting on the magnetic portions of the catheter, and those imparted by the environment. The manner in which the interaction of these forces affects catheter propulsion and control is discussed."
"Mobilty and restraint equipment to date has been designed for relatively small-volume spacecraft. In these vehicles the crew is always within the touch distance of installed equipment and work areas. In anticipation of larger and more spacious spacecraft, a NASA mobility and restraint concept was designed and prototype articles were fabricated. These articles are known as shufflers and they use permanent magnets for a normal holding force. The concept utilizes a shuffling technique where both feet maintain constant contact with the surface. The shuffler's major application will be in transporting bulky equipment and assisting in equipment monitoring and adjustments. A force analysis was performed for each proposed use of the shuffler to establish required magnetic attractive forces for stability. A magnetic analysis was then performed to establish the design parameters of the magnetic circuit necessary to achieve the required forces."
"Magnetic domain-wall motion memory devices have been under development for a number of years. Several techniques have been devised for controllably introducing a pattern of magnetic domains into a saturated background material and for shifting these domains between input and output locations. A particularly flexible version of this class of device, lending itself as well to the performance of magnetic logic, is channeled domain tip propagation. The technique is reviewed. Channeled domain-tip propagation requires some means of defining a pattern of narrow low coercive-force paths within a background material of high coercivity. Several techniques are described which include the use of the surface roughness of an underlying metallic film and the direct coupling between hard and soft magnetic layers for locally modifying coercive force in an appropriate pattern. The variety of magnetic channel structures which can be produced are described along with the resulting magnetic properties and their application to memory and logic devices. Their properties are functions of the size and shape of the channel structures and depend on their orientation with respect to the easy axis of the film and on the composition of the latter. Theory and experiment are presented which describe the dependence of channeled domain-tip coercive force and velocity of propagation on the variables mentioned above. The operation of various magnetic logic elements, including AND, OR, and NOR gates and nonreciprocal propagation paths, i.e., diodes, is discussed. The use of inductive and magnetoresistive schemes for detecting output signals is described. Several specific examples of the application of domain-tip propagation techniques to different memory and logic devices are given. The design and operation of counters, long shift registers, a last-in first-out (LIFQ) list memory, and a first-in first-out (FIFO) serial data buffer memory are discussed. These examples serve to illustrate the criteria used in the design of domain-tip propagation memory devices as well as to demonstrate the use of the bidirectional shifting and magnetic logic capability of the technique."
"High-speed plated-wire memory designs are now capable of 75-ns read cycles and 150-ns write cycles. Future improvement is expected. New fabrication techniques are expected to employ magnetic keepers and eliminate tunnels. Small-diameter wire will also be used. A density of up to 5000 bits per square inch is predicted. Comparisons with semiconductor memory technology are made to support the position that plated-wire memories will remain less expensive than semiconductors above module sizes in the 40 000-60 000-bit range."
"Plated wire is steadily emerging as the preferred storage element for military and space memory applications. Not only are cost and performance improvements extending the regions of application, but reliability conscious military and space programs are adopting this type of memory. This is evidenced by the advent of hardened plated-wire memories for Poseidon and Minuteman missile programs. A prime reason for the attractiveness of plated wire for these applications is its ideal property of true nondestructive readout (NDRO) operation, in which the stored word is retained in the storage medium during all portions of the read cycle. This is made possible by the production of a uniaxial anisotropic closed-flux magnetic film during the plating process."
"Magnetic holography, a storage method based on the combination of techniques of magneto-optics and holography, is shown to have features which are unique to either of these techniques. In contrast to the usual situation in magneto-optics, reconstruction may be obtained with either the Faraday or polar Kerr effect, using polarized or unpolarized light. Furthermore the reconstruction will not be ellipticaly polarized if linearly polarized light is used for readout. In contrast to the usual case in holography, the first-order diffracted wave is polarized at 90° to both the incident and zeroth-order waves. This feature allows a considerable increase in the attainable signal-to-noise in the reconstruction. These and other features are described analytically and demonstrated experimentally."
"Reconstruction effects in a magnetic hologram can easily be interpreted if one assumes a linearly polarized plane wave readout beam. The field transmitted through or reflected off the hologram is rotated via the Faraday or Kerr effect. By decomposing the emerging field into two orthogonal components, one can define separate transmission functions for each polarization. The diffracted field and the efficiency of the magnetic grating are readily computed from these transmission functions. For a binary magnetic grating all diffraction orders, with the exception of zeroth order, are polarized orthogonally to the incoming polarization. For a sinusoidal magnetic grating, the various diffraction orders alternate in polarization with the zeroth order polarized in the same direction as the incoming polarization."
"For polycrystalline and epitaxial films of MnAs, the magnetic phase transformation from the ferromagnetic to the paramagnetic phase was studied. It was found that the films which are removed from the substrate undergo an abrupt loss of magnetization near 38°C within a temperature interval of 0.2°C. They exhibit a temperature hysteresis of 5°C. Films clamped to thick inflexible substrates show a second-order phase transition and a shift in Curie temperature of 35°C per 1-percent volume change due to a difference in thermal expansion coefficient between film and substrate. MnAs films on highly flexible thin plastic foils exhibit a first-order-like phase transition. First-order transition films show a drastic change in resistivity ρ due to microcracks. At 20°C ρ of the virgin film is 1.93 × 10-4Ω cm and increases irreversibly to 6.0 × 10-4Ω cm after 15 transitions. The reversible change varies between a factor of 2.5-3.5. The Hall voltageU_{H} = (R_{0}H + R_{1}M) i/dwas measured and the Hall constants R0and R1were calculated to be 2 × 10-3and 0.33 cm3/A.s respectively, at 20°C."
"Material selection is discussed. The data rate of orthoferrites, garnets, and magnetoplumbite devices, for example, are compared. Also reviewed is the status of propagation circuits. The bubble is examined from the viewpoint of its use as a vehicle to obtain material data. A new method to measure domain-wall mobilities is introduced. This method, which is based on the dynamics of a collapsing bubble, permits measurements to be made over a wide dynamic range."
"The two basic remanent domain structures (RDS) observed in magnetically uniaxial platelets and their variations as a function of the thickness of the platelet and the value of the rotational susceptibility2\\piM_{s}^{2}/K_{1}of the material is discussed. The parallel-plate structure (PPS) first proposed by Landau and Lifshitz represents the lowest energy configuration or ground state for the given geometry, i.e., the easy axis normal to the platelets. The validity of their half-power law connecting the domain width with the thickness of the platelet is discussed in the light of subsequent theories and experiments and is shown to be correct over a limited thickness range only. The honeycomb domain structure (HCS) consisting of a closely packed array of circular cylindrical domains, found later experimentally, is shown by the latest calculations to be a RDS having a total free energy only about 0.4 percent higher than that of the PPS. The domain spacing is found to obey a similar thickness dependence as that in the PPS."
"Longitudinal Kerr and Faraday effects and associated optics of thick and thin iron films sputtered on glass slides and half-cylindrical prisms have been measured as a function of the angle of incidence withpandspolarization occurring at a wavelength of 6328 Å It was shown that a simple two-surface thin-film model correctly predicts the large differences observed between Faradaypandsrotations of an 800 Å film measured through the front and back of a glass slide (\\approx 2x) and through the glass side (\\approx 7x) at a 75° angle of incidence for identically optical paths. These differences result from the nonequivalent transmission coefficients for opposite propagation directions. In addition, the phenomenological model provided reasonable agreement with the observed deep minimum of thepreflectivity (0.05 percent) near 69° incident angle and the correspondingly large optically-enhanced maximum of the Kerrprotation (-5.3°) near 71° incident angle for an approximate 200 Å film deposited on the hypotenuse of a half-cylindrical prism. In order to achieve satisfactory theoretical agreement with these Kerr and Faraday measurements, it was absolutely necessary to take into account the nonlinear dependence of the complex index of refraction of thin iron films on thickness."
"The Kerr effect was used to observe and photograph surface domain patterns in the 0.014-inch 50-percent Ni-Fe strip after high temperature vacuum annealing treatments on commercial cold rolled material. The type of domain pattern observed depended on the recrystallization texture and also on the duration of the annealing treatment. The domain structure in primary recrystallization textures,"
"The notion of relaxation gate is introduced. On its basis, a simple Jordan type model of relaxation is proposed. This model enables the derivation of a formula relating the magnetic after-effect constant with the energy-barrier distribution of microregion magnetization. The magnetic aftereffect constant Sothe remanence\\bar{I}_{R}, and the coercive force Hcwere measured at different aging times for a polycrystal and single crystals of Cu-1-percent Co alloy at a temperature of 600°C. The measurements were performed with a specially adapted measuring arrangement. From the derived formula and data obtained from magnetic measurements, it was found that both heterogenous and homogenous groups of particles become precipitated. At a certain stage of aging, the stable homogenous particles become converted from independent particles into strongly interacting ones."
"A description of the development of a family of high-squareness low-stress-sensitivity Permalloys of controlled coercive force for application as the soft magnetic element in the piggyback twister-type memory is given. Since both the hard- and soft-magnetic elements are wrapped simultaneously around the conductor core, the magnetic properties of both elements must be optimized by a single post-wrap annealing treatment. Previous work on a Co-Fe-Au alloy as the hard magnetic element has led to an annealing temperature range of 800-900°C, which must now be adopted for the treatment of the soft magnetic element as well. From published data on the compositional dependence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy and saturation magnetostriction in Ni-Fe-Mo alloys, an optimum composition, 6 percent Mo-80.5 percent Ni-13.5 percent Fe was first devised for whichdB_{r}/d\\sigma \\simeq 0, B_{r}/B_{s} > 0.9, andH_{c} \\simeq 0.3Oe after post-wrap annealing. By adding small amounts of Be (0.4-0.7 percent) or Zr (0.2-0.4 percent), the coercive force can be controlled to any value up to 3 Oe as a result of precipitation. At the same time, low stress sensitivity was retained and squareness improved."
"The coercive force Hc. saturation magnetization Ms, and squarenessM_{r}/M_{s}of cold-rolled binary Ni-Fe alloys were studied at 300°K over the composition range 0 to 100 percent Ni. These alloys were cold-rolled into thin foils with a reduction in thickness higher than 99 percent. In general, HcandM_{r}/M_{s}of the Ni-Fe alloys of various compositions showed marked frequency responses when the magnetizaion loops were cycled with fields having very low frequencies varying from 0.02 to 2 Hz. The hyperfine fields in the Ni-Fe alloys at the iron sites were determined by means of the Mössbauer effect. The Mössbauer patterns were used to analyze the magnetic heterogeneities caused by the cold-rolling. As concluded from this work, these heterogeneities seem to become appreciably larger near the Invar composition and may be responsible for the observed peaks in the magnitudes of HcandM_{r}/M_{s}of the alloys with 30 and 32.5 percent Ni."
"The applications of magnetic bubbles that are currently seen as most attractive and the current status of development of such devices are considered. A major application is thought to occur in solid-state mass memories. An attractive form of organization is possible whereby relatively short access times can be achieved while using only a small number of read and write circuits. A repertory dialer memory, which has been chosen as a test vehicle, has been developed. The design and performance of the propagating circuits, the self-latching magnetic gates and the generator, which comprise the memory, are discussed. A novel area of application may be in pulse code modulation (PCM) switching networks. It is shown how a network operating as a PCM crossbar switch can be designed using bubbles. A circuit is described which can eliminate the delay associated with bubble propagation in such networks."
"High temperature annealing of thin polished plates of rare-earth orthoferrites has been found highly effective in reducing the coercivity resulting from mechanical processing. The annealing atmosphere must be oxygen or an oxygen-inert gas mixture free of reactive contaminants such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and platinum oxide. Chemical reactions through contact of orthoferrite with other materials must be avoided. Annealing below 1000°C relieves elastic and plastic surface strains and is characterized by an activation energy of 5.8 × 103cal/mole or 0.25 eV/molecule. Temperatures near 1500°C are required to remove brittle fracture damage. High temperature annealing may also be effective in reducing the coercivity caused by some bulk defects. The annealing process is capable of producing high quality orthoferrite plates suitable for domain propagation devices."
"The origin of the aging of SmCo5magnets is shown to be the reaction with adsorbed air. This reaction can be avoided by excluding all oxygen during the preparation. It is shown that by deformation pressing, nonaging magnets can be made because they are dense enough to avoid oxygen penetration. The adsorbed oxygen reacts with Sm during sintering which results in the formation of undesirable Sm2O3. The formation of these oxides can also be avoided by preparing the samples in oxygen-free atmospheres. During deformation pressing theIHcof the powder decreases considerably; this problem can be solved by using hydrogen-ground powder which has a very high coercive force."
"The Soniscan ferroacoustic memory is a new all-electronic mass storage system which utilizes a propagating sonic pulse to access a batch-fabricated film storage medium. The storage element consists of two magnetostrictive film layers with a conductor sandwiched between them. They are deposited on a thin glass substrate and etched into a suitable pattern. A piezoelectric transducer is bonded to one edge of the substrate. The switching behavior of the magnetic storage element is described by a modified Stoner-Wohlfarth model and the sonic wave generation and propagation by a one-dimensional transmission-line analog. The fabrication and operation of the storage elements are discussed. The design of a 107bit memory system is presented. A 2048-bit experimental model of a Soniscan memory has been constructed. It has an access time of less than 2μs, a data rate of 7 Mbit/s/line, and a storage density of 4000 bit/in2A Soniscan bulk store will be relatively inexpensive, since memory planes are batch fabricated; a single electronic unit, the transducer driver switch, half-selects tens of thousands of bits during reading and writing; and sense and recording electronics are shared among many planes by the series stringing of write-sense lines. It is expected that Soniscan will present an attractive alternative to electromechanical units in many applications."
"The earlier successful techniques for numerical solution of magnetic field problems required defining a field quantity and magnetic permeability over the problem grid model. Later improved but limited techniques were introduced whereby it was necessary to define only a field quantity, usually a potentia function, over the grid because the magnetic material characteristics were incorporated directly into the equations. The work presented in this paper represents a culmination of these latter efforts in that technique is presented whereby the general three-dimensional magnetic field boundary value problem with current regions can be solved numerically."
"Coercive force values for plated wire as detetermined on a conventional hysteresis looper are discussed. In particular, the variation of Hcwith easy-axis drive amplitude as well as the lack of agreement between the looper Hcand the easy-axis disturb threshold for a discrete bit written into the plated wire is investigated. It has been confirmed that the Hcvariation is a rise-time, not a drive amplitude, effect. In addition, the disagreement between the discrete bit digit-disturb threshold and the looper Hcoccurs because the looper cannot measure any value below the nucleation threshold of the plated wire."
"To determine the origin of grains having spurious orientations in otherwise well-oriented silicon steel, it is sometimes desirable to observe simultaneously the shape and distribution of grains having specific orientations in a large sample of a coarse-grained polycrystalline sheet. A technique related to optical goniometry and an optical device for making the desired observations are described in detail. Photographic records of such observations are presented and explained. This device and rapid technique can be used to depict the preferred orientation in large (and therefore, statistically significant) samples of coarse-grained polycrystalline material. Present methods, which involve the stereographic plotting of poles of many grains, whose orientations have been determined by as many Laue interpretations, could be supplanted. Resulting photographic records could be more widely and intuitively understood, particularly by less technically skilled observers, since interpretation does not require familiarity with pole figures or stereographic projection."
"The orientation of acicular particles in the active layer of a magnetic tape is presently a usual technological process applied in magnetic tape production. The theory of this process is dealt with. A mathematical model is deduced, describing the behavior of an isolated agglomerate of acicular particles in an external magnetic field and the change of its microstructure, i.e., the orientation of acicular particles in the agglomerate. The term for the density of probability ω(α) of the angle distribution α of the longer particle axes in the orientated agglomerate is also deduced. Also the approximate relation between the orientation degree, defined by the mean quadratic deviationsof the angles α of the particular particles and by the bevel values γ of the deformed agglomerate, is shown. It appears that, besides the orientation by means of the external magnetic field, it would also be possible to orientate the magnetic suspension by other methods."
"The coherent rotation model of magnetization reversal is applied to crystallographically cubic films magetized perpendicularly to the film plane. The model is used to predict the hysteretic properties of single crystal films of gadolinium iron garnet chemically deposited on yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) substrates. Included in the analysis is the magnetoelastic coupling resulting from the induced in-plane strain in the film. By substituting Tb for Gd ions in the iron garnet, the magnetoelastic coupling can be used to control the coercive field for the [111]-oriented films and the remanence ratio for [100]-oriented films. The application of these films to magnetothermal recording using a polar Faraday effect for readout is discussed."
"A Kerr magnetooptical ammeter is described which uses a Permalloy thin film in order to make contact-free measurements of the current flowing through a conductor. The device is useful for current measurement in high-voltage lines. In this ammeter, the strength of the current is measured by measuring the position of a domain wall which traverses a narrow channel sensor composed of a Permalloy thin film under the stray magnetic field due to a current. Contact-free observation of the domain wall is achieved by means of a Kerr magnetooptical apparatus using a high-pressure mercury lamp as a light source. The easy axis of the Permalloy thin film is parallel to the stray magnetic field. The domain wall traverses a distance of 15 mm at 70 amperes. The size of the sensor is 0.5 by 20 mm."
"Four series of polycrystalline Y, Gd, I, and garnets, containing Co2+and counterbalanced by Si4+have been studied. The permeability shows a pronounced peak (up to μ = 500); the coercive force and the gyromagnetic linewidth show minimums for small substitutions of cobalt. These experimental features are in connection with the possibility of having a compensation of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of Fe3+ions by Co2+octahedral ions. After a comparison between cobalt-doped garnets and classical Y, Gd, Al garnets, it is possible to conclude that the cobalt doping is a new interesting way to improve the microwave materials."
"Barium ferrite (Ba.0.6Fe2O3) platelets of approximately\\frac{1}{2}\\mum diameter and with intrinsic coercive force of about 5000 Oe were crystallized from a glass phase. To study the nature of the defects and their influence on the magnetic properties, the crystailized glass was plastically deformed by applying a pressure of 30 kbar in an opposed anvil press. Barium ferrite platelets were extracted from the crystailized glass by leaching the matrix in acetic acid. Magnetic measurements indicated 1 to 2 percent increase in saturation magnetization and about 40 percent decrease in coercive force in the deformed platelets compared to the properties in the undeformed platelets. Transmission electron microscopy revealed deformation twins, nonbasal slip, and stacking faults in the deformed platelets. In another experiment, the platelets after leaching the matrix were deformed at 30-kbar pressure. Saturation magnetization decreased by 9 percent and coercive force by 55 percent. The results are discussed by comparing with the changes in properties obtained in ball milled powders. Annealing the deformed powders resulted in partial recovery of saturation magnetization and coercive force to the original undeformed state."
"In ferrites the resonance character of the dispersion of the domain-wall movement can be systematically obtained by a specific preparation technology. This resonance character could be attributed to a discontinuity of the walls. The main practical interest of such materials is the possibility to shift the dispersion and the losses threshold to higher frequencies, for a given susceptibility, in comparison with a standard material having the same composition. A material capable of working in the VHF range is presented."
"Polycrystalline and single crystal films of GdIG were produced on a variety of substrates by RF sputtering and subsequent annealing. The effects of this annealing on the film properties are discussed. The deviation of the lattice parameters from the ideal value of 12.47 Å was consistent with the strain produced by the mismatch in the thermal expansion coefficients. Optical absorption measurements indicated that the as-sputtered films contained both Fe2+and Fe3+ions. The coercive force (T-T_{c}) degrees above the compensation point did not depend upon the type of substrate or heat treatment. The temperature dependence of the Faraday rotation was consistent with the presence of a distribution in compensation points throughout the film. Films on YAG were subjected to varying heat treatments, and it was found that the average compensation temperature Tcof a given film depended on the nature of the anneal. The behavior of the film upon annealing can be explained by a model in which the film successively experiences nucleation and grain growth, oxidation, and Al diffusion."
"A kind of unidirectional anisotropy determining one easy direction of magnetization in a limited field range results from the preferential cone for the position of spontaneous magnetization. In single domain particles, the preferential cone causes a constricted magnetization curve, parts of which are similar to a reversible rectifier characteristic that is not found in constricted Perminvar-type loops. The properties of this anisotropy are discussed by the example of hexagonal crystals; calculated magnetization curves and experimental results are given. The characteristic described may be useful in memory application with nondestructive readout and non-linear applications."
"Fabrication of thin-film recording heads with 30-μm wide gaps in 25-μm thick Permalloy have been reported previously. Formation of narrow gaps by chemical etching was limited by undercutting. This paper describes a process for fabricating thin-film recording heads with gaps 2 μm wide in Permalloy film which is 2.5 μm thick. The process makes use of electroplating, photoetching, and electron beam technologies. The narrow gaps with vertical walls are made possible by the use of electron sensitive resist, electron beam exposure of 2-μm wide strips, and electroplating of 2.5-μm thick films of Permalloy on each side of the narrow strip of the electron sensitive resist."
  "A new process for preparing coprecipitated lithium-containing ferrites is presented. Chemical coprecipitation results in a fine particle powder which, if properly sintered, yields fast switching memory cores. Ferrites containing Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn, etc., are readily coprecipitated because of the insolubility of their hydroxides and oxalates. Lithium, because of its solubility, cannot be precipitated as a hydroxide or oxalate in an aqueous solution, but it was found that it can be coprecipitated in the form of a stearate from an ammonium or tetramethylammonium hydroxide-stearic acid solution. The other elements are coprecipitated from the solution as hydroxides. The stearate is burned from the dried precipitate powder, leaving a ferrite with a specific surface area of 40 m2/g. The switching speed of cores fabricated from coprecipitated lithium manganese ferrite is improved compared to cores prepared by the mixed oxide process but only at the expense of a higher drive."
   "The metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) is finding widespread application as a technology for memory systems, due both to advantageous device and technology characteristics, and to the unique requirements of the memory environment. The technology has proven quite versatile, and among the applications are random access systems, shift registers, and read-only storage. Both complementary and noncomplementary technologies have been used. The backgrounud and philosophy of using MOSFETs as a memory technology are reviewed, and the recent developments, trends, and the current state of the art are summarized."
"A new head fabrication technique is described and the experimental performance reported. The device is a single-turn head suited for head-per-track operation. The head strip is produced by rolling fiat a metallic cylinder consisting of an outer jacket of magnetic material surrounding an inner core of nonmagnetic conductor. Lapping off the bottom of the fiat strip creates the gap and the addition of current leads completes the head configuration. The number of leads determines the number of heads. Mounted into a flying shoe, the head was sine-wave tested by writing with increasing head current and then by observing the read-back signal with frequency as the parameter. The write process is unusual in that the saturation write current decreases sharply with increasing frequency."
                "A model for thermomagnetic writing in a GdlG platelet held at its compensation temperature is developed and confirming experimental data are presented. It is postulated that magnetization reversal occurs by domain nucleation and expansion. The relationship between the applied fieldH, the final bit diameterD, and the absorbed energyP\\tauis shown to beH = K^{-1}[(D^{2}\\rhoc\\omega)/(\\alphaP\\tau)][(1/2)E_{c}+ \\sigma_{\\omega}/D]whereK = 0.112is a normalization constant, ρ the density,cthe specific heat, ω the sample thickness, α a constant relating the magnetization and the temperature, Ecthe domain-wall coercive pressure, and σωis the wall energy per unit area. Domains withD < D_{c} = 2 \\sigma_{\\omega}/E_{c}are unstable and collapse when the sample returns to the compensation temperature. Measurements are reported of the dependence ofDonHfor several values of Ptaufor a 13-μm thick platelet of aluminum doped GdIG. The quantitative agreement between theory and experiment is good. Observations of domain switching during the heat pulse application confirm all the major features of the model. The results show that in thick and low coercive force platelets, an excessive amount of power is required to write at moderate fields and the bit density is limited by the instability forD < D_{c}. Typical values areP = 100mW,\\tau = 1\\mus,H = 100Oe, andD_{c} = 20\\mum. In thin and high coercive force films it should be possible to write 10-μm size bits with a field of < 100 Oe and a power level of 10 mW absorbed in 1 μs"
   "Indirect exchange coupling through magnetic bridges and magnetostatic coupling attributed to dipole-dipole interaction were observed in multilayer ferromagnetic film structures. This multilayer film consisted of an ordinary NiFe film with a normal uniaxial anisotropy, a thin separation layer of chromium and gold, and an anomalous NiFe film with a pronounced rotatable remanent magnetization. Both types of coupling produced a bias field and thus caused asymmetric magnetic properties of the ordinary film. It was also found that the effective coercive force of the ordinary film was greatly influenced by the interaction between domain walls and the stray field of the surface pole distribution. Generally, it increased as a result of the coupling and decreased exponentially as the thickness of the separation layer increased. Because of the presence of the magnetic coupling between the magnetizations and the interaction between normal walls and the stray field of the surface pole distribution, the coercive force of the ordinary film was found to be magnetically alterable by changing the remanent magnetization direction of the anomalous film."
             "In two dimensional problems with the current flow in only one direction, the magnetic field can be solved by computing a scalar potential or one component of the vector potential. The general formulation for three dimensional solutions, including nonlinearities, is more complex and requires all three components of the vector potential as well as a scalar potential for the description of the fields. It is the purpose of this paper to present a general systematic formulation at low frequencies in terms of potential functions for three dimensional numerical solutions of the nonlinear electro-magnetic field problems that include either nonlinear magnetic materials or nonlinear electric materials. Special cases of the magnetostatic as well as eddy-current problems are discussed."
"Twin and grain boundaries impede the motion of magnetic domain walls in the orthoferrites. Bubbles distort and collapse before it is possible to propagate them through twin boundaries and all but very low angle grain boundaries. A new experimental technique has been used to measure the coercivity of isolated defects in nearly perfect crystals. The coercivity measured is the minimum applied field required to force a planar domain wall past a defect. Models of the spin configurations near twin and grain boundaries in the presence and absence of magnetic domain walls have been developed to explain the observed coercivities."
  "Wall anisotropy causes bubble domains to be elliptical. A formula relating the eccentricity of an elliptical bubble to the anisotropic wall energy is derived, and an experimental technique for measuring the wall anisotropy is described. In Sm0.55Tb0.45FeO3a measured anisotropy energy of 1.7 percent of the wall-energy density at room temperature is responsible for eccentricities as large as 0.4 at average bubble radii equal to 85 percent of the bubble strip-domain transition radius. The relationship between material parameters and wall-energy anisotropy is briefly discussed."
  "The direction of the mean magnetization during magnetization rotation in uniaxial thin films with a reverse field which increased quasistatically has been investigated. The analysis of the observations shows that several effects happen during the magnetization rotation: reversible influence of nonlinear torques in the free ripple region, blocking, irreversible torques, deblocking, stabilization by the intrinsic demagnetizing field, locking, and partial rotation. At the critical astroid of the single-domain theory, the films do not show any critical effect during the magnetization rotation. The critical effects are given by blocking and locking. These film properties are determined by the structure constant S. Even in the nonblocked-ripple region, the mean magnetization deviates from the direction expected, according to the single-domain theory or the linear-ripple theory. This indicates the existence of nonlinear torques. After passing the blocking curve, the intrinsic demagnetizing field contributes dominantly to the nonlinear torque. This field is responsible for the stabilization of the magnetization."
"Recently Iwasaki and Suzuki pointed out that demagnetization could conceivably be very significant during the writing process and presented a self-consistent iterative calculation of the writing process which confirmed their views. In the present study we extend their scheme to study an isolated transition region of finite track width by considering what happens to the transition when the head field is removed. Of particular significance in the final calculated results is the high asymmetry of the magnetization distribution. A detailed comparison was done between the results of the iterative calculation and previous theories of the transition region over a large range of material parameters. It is found that the iteratively calculated transition regions are significantly larger than those calculated by previous authors. Results are also compared to experimental data obtained by electron microscopy."
"The instability of the particle distribution on the Preisach diagram increases markedly with the increasing squareness ratioM_{r}/M_{s}and the packing density of fine magnetic particles. This fact means that the instability of particle distribution is closely related to the existence of the strong interaction field which depends on the intensity of the magnetization of the medium. To obtain the intrinsic or stable particle distribution, the effective field strength acting in the medium has been expressed in terms of the interaction field which should be called the Onsager field. Furthermore, the effect of the interaction field on the process of anhysteretic magnetization was interpreted on the modified Preisach diagram."
"Two identical linear dipole distributions are assumed to be localized onto two parallel straight lines; the dipole moment per unit length is assumed to be constant along each line ; the common easy anisotropy axis is normal to these straight lines and lies in their common plane. The coercive field of the pair is identical with the coercive field of one dipole line, and the reversal mode is fanning. If the pair is initially parallel and a magnetic field opposite to its direction is applied to only one dipole, the effective coercivity which results is larger and increases for decreasing distance between the linear dipoles. The reversal mode is fanning; nevertheless the final configuration can be antiparallel, i.e., with reversal of only the dipole subjected to the field. This configuration remains stable after removal of the field if and only if the dipoles are far enough apart the minimum distance can be related to the transition length in digital recording."
  "A simple graphical method is proposed to predict device performance of an integrated flat-film memory cell. The method uses a set of experimentally determined write and creep curves as fundamental design parameters. The method can provide such important information as signal flux and drive currents once the device geometries and keeper permeability are chosen. Good agreement has been obtained between prediction and experiment."
                 "Using a ring-core sensor and a bridge-type peak detector, a compact low-power consumption fluxgate magnetometer of gamma-level sensitivity has been designed which uses commercial tape-wound cores. The magnetometer is of the unbalanced type as contrasted to the 2nd-harmonic type and has a total power consumption of 44 mW with an output sensitivity in excess of 0.004 volts per gamma."
 "The variation of the fall-back angle ergo of evaporated Permalloy films due to the magnetic anneal was measured on restricted small areas of films in the composition range from 50 percent Ni to 95 percent Ni. The magnitude of the random anisotropy of crystallites was indirectly evaluated by using the dispersion theory of Hoffmann. For films deposited in a conventional vacuum (\\sim10^{-5}torr), the compositional dependence of the random anisotropy agrees satisfactorily with that of modified Doyle-Finnegan's model so far as the Ni concentration exceeds 70 percent. Here the modification is made, taking into consideration that the uniaxial anisotropy of each crystallite fluctuates spatially, depending upon its crystallographic orientation. The deviation of the experiments from the theory in the case of Ni concentration less than 70 percent may be partly due to the magnetostrictive contribution through the anisotropic planar stress in crystallites. For films prepared in an ultra-high vacuum ( <10-7tort), on the other hand, any stress effect does not seem to play an important role to the random anisotropy."
"The storage density of coupled film memory elements has been increased from 104 bit/in2 to 0.25 X 106 bit/in2. The size and the density of a chip containing 4250 bits with a penny as background are illustrated, and the enlarged view of the same chip is shown. The high density is made possible by improving flux closures in both the easy and hard directions through the use of thin conductors, thin insulations, and Permalloy keepers. The device storage stability is enhanced to permit NDRO operation through the use of multiple-pulse write and/or hard-direction bias fields. Typical performance parameters are IW = 60 mA, IB = 20 mA, and Vs = 150 μV."

     "The forward current transfer ratioh_{FE} = I_{collector}/I_{base}of a germanium bipolar transistor is reduced by the application of a magnetic field. This reduction is greatest when the magnetic vector is perpendicular to the direction of the minority carrier motion through the base region. Electronic instruments which are operated in a strong magnetic field will be adversely affected."

"The pressures on cylindrical magnetic domain walls are discussed with particular emphasis on bubbles, that is, near-circular domains. In the case of anisotropic wall energy, bubbles will be slightly elliptical, and a formula is derived relating the ellipticity to the anisotropic wall energy. Various formulations for the average magnetic field at a domain wall are presented. The problem of cutting bubbles off from a strip wall is investigated. It is seen that the field required to cut off a bubble can be up to 40 percent less than the 4πMsrequired to push two parallel walls together for certain geometries"
"Under the assumption that in a double-layer film both layers are equally deformed, the following formula for the magnetostriction energyE = K_{c} \\sin^{2} \\alphahas been derived whereK_{c} = (9/40)(2U'U\"/U'_{0} + U_{0}\")is the coupling constant and α is the angle between the magnetization vectors. This formula is valid if we can neglect interaction with the substrate. The sign of the coupling constant is discussed. It turns out that where the composition of the two layers are different, the value of Kccan be, in some special cases, negative."
"Investigations of the formation and magnetic properties of MnδCo1-δFe2O4formed in alkaline aqueous solution by the coprecipitation method are covered. The lattice constant of these ferrites apparently reduced with decreasing average particle size below about 500 Å. The coercive force ratio of MnFe2O4and Co-Fe2O4is 1 to 50 and equal to that of the crystal magnetic anisotropy coefficient K1of sintered ferrites. As the average particle size became larger, the coercive force and the apparent remanence increased linearly, and superparamagnetic critical size was determined. The sizes range, for example, from 50 to 100 Å for CoFe2O4and from 150 to 200 Å. for MnFe2O4. From the correlation between the average particle size and their magnetization, the limit size of ferromagnetic critical particle was also determined. Results obtained in this experiment are approximately in accord with Néel's Version of the theory on thermal fluctuation aftereffect of magnetic fine particles."
"Based on the finding that the temperature dependence of fluxgate sensors is proportional to the measured field, a temperature compensation circuit is described using the copper resistance of the fluxgate secondary winding as the thermosensitive part of a bridge. The bridge voltage is derived from the magnetometer output so the compensation is only active in high fields."
"A simple model for oxidized thin ferromagnetic film deposited on a substrate based on the concept of surface spin pinning is proposed. A spin wave analysis of the spatial distribution of the magnetization through the film thickness, as well as of the total relative magnetization, is performed. Qualitative results are reported for three different cases: complete pinning of spins on both surfaces, one pinned and one free surface, and two free surfaces. It is shown that an appropriate choice of the surface anisotropy could account for various positions of standing spin wave resonances, even contradictory ones, as reported in the literature."
"The influence of light on the switching behavior of Si-doped Y3Fe5O12and Co-substituted Ni-Zn ferrites is investigated. After irradiation with light, YIG (Si) has an extremely square hysteresis loop, and the switching transients display anomalous behavior. When a step field is applied, there is a certain period of time during which no flux is switched irreversibly. After this delay, which depends on the amplitude of the applied step field, the material switches in the normal way. At 4.2 and 77°K these changes are permanent; at 200°K the effects disappear after illumination is terminated. The results are discussed in terms of a two-center model, which was proposed earlier to explain results for changes in permeability. Co-substituted Ni-Zn ferrites show similar behavior already in the nonirradiated state. Irradiation increases the coercive force and also the break-free behavior becomes more pronounced. These changes are still permanent at 200°K."
 "The use of reflecting substrates to enhance the Kerr magnetooptic effect has frequently been discussed. The nature of such a realizable high reflectivity mirror is described in a simple way."
"The classical field theory superposition principle, the central limit theorem, and the gyromagnetic equations of motion are invoked as a basis to formulate a quasi-static statistical model for polycrystalline ferrite media with Gaussian statistics. The use of this model to analyze small signal reversible rotational phenomena is illustrated. It is also demonstrated that this model and a previous microwave model given by the authors are maximum entropy models An analogy between the maximum entropy property of these models and the Gibbs thermodynamic equivalence for equilibrium and a state of maximum entropy is noted."
"The bending oscillations of the film-substrate system, explained by magnetostriction interaction, were observed at parametric excitation of thin magnetic films at the frequency 11 MHz. The frequency of the bending oscillations changed from 104to 105Hz. The dependences of the elastic modes on dc and HF magnetic fields affecting the film have been investigated. Some advice for the technical applications of the observed phenomenon is given in this paper."
"Results are presented which identify a dominant aging mechanism of plated-wire memory elements in the absence of magnetic fields. This mechanism, i.e., stress relief in the Permalloy film, can occur even in elements stabilized against field-induced aging. The evidence for stress relief consists of aging and strain sensitivity measurements on samples of different Permalloy composition. In aging experiments under vacuum at 230°C, Ni-rich films show an increase in anisotropy field Hk, while Fe-rich films show a decrease. A stress relief model is described which relates such aging changes to the initial film stress the cylindrical geometry, and the tension strain sensitivity. Using this model, agreement is found between film stress deduced from the Hkaging changes, and film stress from direct measurements, reported in the literature. Films which are judged to have zeromagnetostrictive composition (ZMC) on the basis of torsion sensitivity are found to show nonzero tension sensitivity. This is satisfactorily accounted for by circumferential composition inhomogeneity, which is shown analytically to explain the observed decrease in anisotropy field with tension. It is concluded that reduction of such inhomogeneity by appropriate deposition techniques is favorable to both smaller strain sensitivity and increased aging stability."
"Electron microscopy was used to analyze the crystallographic and magnetic structures of high-coercive-force Co-Cr composite films. The chromium sublayer appears to give high coercive forces by causing the growth of cobalt in the hexagonal phase with a relatively narrow distribution of grain sizes. Magnetization reversal was examined by Lorentz microscopy of films with coercive fields up toH_{c} = 900Oe. It proceeds by nucleation and extension of magnetostatically coupled domains. The progressive limitation of these extensions as the coercive force increases illustrates the connection between the magnetostatic coupling, the coercive force, and the squareness of the hysteresis loop. Lorentz microscopy was also used to investigate a recorded transition between NRZ 1 and 0 states and showed a saw-toothed structure, characteristic of a magnetization in the plane of the film."
"A magnetically coupled tunnel diode oscillator employing a square-loop core is analyzed. Particular emphasis is given to understanding the effects of small, yet inevitable, leakage inductances and the inductance of the dc source on the switching pattern of the tunnel diodes. The combined size of these inductances is found to be the determining factor that leads to many unusual switching phenomena encountered with the inverter. Included in these phenomena is the delayed switching of the tunnel diodes, which manifests itself in the formation of a quasi-square wave at the inverter output in what can be a serious loss in efficiency. Physical explanations and mathematical analysis which bring into focus the significant effects of these stray elements are presented."
"For any input signal of logic elements (LE) which realize logical functions ofK-valued logic to be converted into any output signal, it has been shown to be sufficient that the LE have2(K- 1)different input-output characteristics without equal values of the output signal at neighboring discrete values of input signals. Sufficient conditions for stable operation of both long closed and short logical chains of elements with characteristics under consideration are formulated."
"An historical survey of the memory industry is given, and the progress of the ferrite core memory since it was first introduced is examined. It is shown that the computer industry could not have developed without a reliable and relatively cheap storage element capable of being produced in great quantity. The core memory satisfied this requirement but appeared to be vulnerable to competition by technologies more suited to mass production. The reasons why core memories have not been supplanted are examined, and a forecast for the next ten years is presented. The prediction is that core memories will retain the largest share of dollar-volume in on-line memory industry for the duration of this period."
"A signal-to-noise analysis is presented to show its influence on the design of magnetic film memory arrays. The device geometry and array dimensions are varied independently to find the design limits within which reliable signal detection can be performed, that is, the range within which adequate signal-to-noise ratio is obtained at the sense amplifier. The result is a plot of the required number of READ pulses for any combination of line width and line length in the range of interest. Line widths between 1/2- and 4-Mil and array sizes up to 4096 × 4096 bits were investigated. Multipulse readout is required for line widths less than 1.5-mils. A 256 × 256 array of 1/2-mil lines on 1-mil centers requires 12 signal pulses of 3-ns duration each, whereas a 1024 × 1024 array of 1-mil lines on 2-mil centers requires 7 signal pulses. It should be noted that in addition to adequate signal-to-noise ratio, a minimum of signal is needed (not obtainable through multiple READs) commensurate with the gain of the sense amplifier. These considerations are all combined in a set of design curves which can be used to make design tradeoffs between device size, array size, and cycle time."
"The Riemersma critical state model is applied to a long irreversible type-II superconductor carrying ac. Voltage waveforms, energy loss per cycle, and limiting values of effective resistivity are derived. For sinusoidal current of frequency f in 10-mil wire the critical current limit of resistivity is 4.06 × 10-14f (ω.m). An equivalent circuit consisting of a variable inductance is proposed. Ex-perinlents at 4.2°K on bifilar windings of bare and copper-plated single-strand 10-mil nb-25Zr wire at 60, 400, and 800 Hz gave only fair agreement with the model with indications that the model can be improved by including surface hysteresis and eddy-current effects. Experimental values of resistivity agree more with Zar than with Wisseman, leading to the conclusion that continuous ac power applications of superconductivity are not attractive for the sake of efficiency. There remains some promise for dc energy storage for discharge into pulse power devices."
"An accurate solution to the nonlinear magnetic field boundary value problem which results when ferromagnetic materials are present is generally very difficult to obtain. Several computer codes based on a magnetic vector potential have been published in the literature. While those codes can be used to solve 2-dimensional problems, difficulties arise in their application to 3-dimensional problems. One difficulty is the complexity of the resulting differential equations which must be solved. This paper treats the more complex 3-dimensional solutions as derived from the concept of a scalar magnetic potential. The most desirable feature of this approach is that the magnetic material characteristics are incorporated directly into one second order nonlinear partial differential equation which can be solved on a digital computer using standard finite difference schemes. In order to add credence to the validity of the technique presented, a simple 3-dimensional magnetic field boundary value problem is posed and solved."
"A theoretical treatment for the readback process in digital magnetic recording is presented. Three major factors, namely, the medium constantswhich defines the extent of the surface charge density, the head-to-medium spacingd, and the read head gap2 g,are taken into consideration. A general solution giving the characteristics of pulse readback signal is shown as a function ofs,dandg. Both amplitude and pulse width of the readback signal are arranged as a product of the medium loss, spacing loss, and gap loss, making it easy to describe the influence of each factor separately. The final value of the amplitude and the pulse width is proportional to that of the recorded surface charge density. Spacing loss simply depends on the ratio ofd/s; gap loss depends on the ratio ofg/(s + d). Theoretical results are compared with experiments which show good agreement for a wide combination ofs,d, andg."
"Samples of magnetic particles were prepared in dry powder form, as well as in a plastic binder system. Magnetic measurements were made on the samples as function of the volumetric packing factor. Coercive force Hc, squareness, and anhysteretic magnetization measurements are correlated with the uniformity of particle dispersion. It was found that the behavior of Hc, squareness, and the initial anhysteretic susceptibility as a function of the packing factor are good indications of the degree of dispersion of the particles. It is shown that if the particles are well dispersed, Hcincreased with increased dilution, and the initial anhysteretic susceptibility increased at both high and low dilutions. A mathematical model is developed to explain the observed results. The model consists of a double distribution of interaction fields to account for the well-dispersed and the agglomerated particles."
"Five kinds of acicular γ-Fe2O3powder of which axial length varies from 0.17 to 0.80 μm with almost the same axial ratio are manufactured. The variance of coercive force and printing effect as the average axial length of the particles varies is shown. Coercive force of which particle axial length is about 0.35 μm shows maximum value. The printing effect increases according to the decrease of axial length. The printing effect increases with contacting time. The temperature dependence of coercive force and remanent magnetization are measured from 25 to 200°C. These two properties decrease as the temperature increases, but the decreasing inclination becomes steeper as the axial length is smaller. The relationship between the printing effect and the decreasing inclination of coercive force is nearly linear. From the temperature dependence of the printing effect, the activation energy of the printing effect can be calculated. The activation energy of the smallest particle is about 0.05 eV and the others are about 0.15 eV. This measured activation energy is discussed in connection with the relaxation equation."
"The fabrication and operation of high-density (0.25 × 106bit/in2) nondestructive readout (NDRO) memory elements are described. The high density is made possible by coupled films and Permalloy keeper. The NDRO is made possible by multiple-pulse WRITE or hard-direction bias field. Typical performance parameters areI_{w} = 60mA,I_{b} = 30mA, andV_{s} = 150μV/3 ns. The small signal is detectable by multiple-pulse READ. When such memory elements are to be fabricated with peripheral circuits on the same Si chip, a self-contained chip will be obtained. Such chips could enjoy the same advantages as semiconductor memory chips such as few leads, modularity, amenability to bit organization, and possibility for error-correction, but would be capable of higher storage density due to simpler planar configuration."
"Zero magnetostrictive films about 1000 Å thick with cobalt contents from 0 to approximately 50 percent have been subjected to easy- and hard-axis saturating fields. The changes in characteristics were examined on aging for four hours in 30°C steps up to 240°C. Anisotropy field, dispersion, and coercive force were examined. The anisotropy and dispersion changes on aging indicated somewhat faster aging for samples with increasing cobalt. This is as expected for anM-induced annealing mechanism. However, the differences were small; maximum differences in the parameters, after aging to 150°C, between samples with different cobalt contents were ±10 percent."
"The core noise was measured for the half-wave push-pull magnetic amplifiers using various ferromagnetic materials as functions of the number of laminations of a stacked ring core and ac supply frequency. A statistical model of the core noise is proposed. It was deduced that the mean number of magnetic elementary regions associated with the core noise is proportional to values ranging fromftof^{3/5}, wherefis the ac frequency."
 "A small-signal gain of 39 dB in a nonresonant multi-path CO2laser amplifier with a discharge length of 65 cm is reported. The multipath system employed is a modified White optical reflector design. An unsaturated gain of 39 dB was observed for signals smaller than 10-5watt. No noise component, due to the amplifier, was detected for signals as small as5 \\times 10^{-8}watt."

"A theoretical analysis of acoustooptical pulse modulators is given. Calculations are carried out that yield the intensity and rise time of the scattered light. The optimum relationship between the dimensions of the optical and acoustic beam is given. A fast high-efficiency modulator has been built based on the theoretical results. The modulator is composed of a 350-MHz ZnO transducer sputtered on a quartz acoustic lens and an As2S3glass serving as the modulating material. With 0.6 watt of electrical RF peak power driving the modulator, 70 percent of the light intensity (at 0.63μ) is deflected. The rise time of the scattered light pulse is of the order of 6 ns."
"A detailed theoretical analysis of the problem of elastic second-harmonic generation (SHG) by longitudinal ultrasonic beams of finite dimension propagating in isotroplc media or along certain pure mode axes in crystals has been made. A formulation for optical SHG by Gaussian laser beams, adapted to the ultrasonic case, has allowed calculation of the intensity profile and angular intensity distribution of the second-harmonic beam as a function of distance from the generating fundamental frequency transducer. These calculations were confirmed experimentally, using the beam probing techniques of Bragg diffraction, for both focused and unfocused longitudinal beams, in the frequency range 200-500 MHz, propagating along the Z axis in crystal quartz. Ultrasonic diffraction of the fundamental beam is shown to result in reduction of second-harmonic intensity compared to the intensity normally calculated from plane-wave theory. Consideration of this reduction allowed an accurate value of the third-order elastic constant c333to be determined from the measured second-harmonic intensity. The effect of reflection at a crystal-air interface on SHG has also been investigated."
"The sensitivity of nondiffuse double-exposure holographic interferometry can be increased for the case of transparent experimental media if the test beam of the interferometer is multiply passed through the experimental medium. This can be accomplished with fairly high spatial resolution if the experimental medium is placed within a lossy optical cavity. The cavity serves to generate a number of component test beams, each one having passed through the experimental medium a different number of times. If the cavity is sufficiently long that successive test beam components are no longer mutually coherent, an off-axis hologram can be formed with a single component by matching the path lengths of the reference beam and the test beam component in question. This allows one to record double-exposure holographic interferograms with increased sensitivity. An experimental arrangement that has produced interferograms with six times the normal sensitivity is described, and the limitations of the technique are discussed."
"Injection lasers are suitable sources of radiation for optical communication systems. The output characteristics of III-V compound and mixed crystal III-V compound injection lasers for0.64-1.1-\\muspectral range are described. In order to improve the spectral output (and to increase the threshold for the appearance of adjacent modes) composite cavities were successfully used. Such a cavity contains the diode and a passive transparent flat plate, which serves as an additional selective component in the feedback circuit of the laser. A 96-channel telephone link was tested in the laboratory using four lasers (wavelengths 0.74, 0.78, 0.85, and 0.91μ) in one beam. The method of combining and separating the four spectral channels at the transmitter and receiver, respectively, as well as the results of the experiments are described."
"A laser source suitable for plasma production is described. The technique involves the use of uncoated flats that act as mode selectors when inserted inside the laser cavity. Pulse widths of 15 to 30 and 60 to 70 ps were obtained with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 20 dB for 70 to 80 percent of the laser firings."
"It is shown that high-gain giant-pulse lasers can have transverse intensity profiles differing greatly from the steady-state transverse-mode patterns. The transient effects of gain saturation may cause the intensity profile at the output mirror to change rapidly with time. This can lead to non-Gaussian output intensity profiles, short-duration intense regions (\"hot spots\"), and irregular time behavior. Shortening the cavity length, i.e., increasing the resonator Fresnel number, which is often done to reduce the number of longitudinal resonances, will only enhance these effects."
"The general considerations and principles involved with IR image up-conversion are presented and discussed. The factors that limit the resolution of the up-converted image are analyzed and the merits of three types of optical systems are discussed with regard to resolution and efficiency of up-conversion. Several characteristics of six nonlinear crystals are calculated and compared."
 "Two-photon fluorescence and second-harmonic generation experiments have been used recently to study the picosecond structure of laser signals. A general theory of these measurements is presented in this work, which includes a detailed analysis of the possible responses of the measurement to a mode-locked laser that produces pulses and to a free-running laser that produces a noise-like output. Shapes Of the expected response patterns are calculated; second-order statistics that describe statistical departures from the expected patterns are also determined. Results are given for an arbitrary number of laser modes and general mode spectrum, in computationally useful forms for small and large mode number. Illustrative examples for large mode number are worked out for Gaussian and uniform mode profile curves; in addition, exact results are obtained for the uniform case of any (odd) number of modes. Sample response patterns for the case of a free-running laser are calculated by Monte-Carlo technique for Gaussian and uniform mode spectra. Results that reduce to special cases treated in various prior works are pointed out and new findings are discussed."
"Several different versions [1]-[3] of the open-ended Michelson-type interferometric resonator have been proposed as axial-mode selectors for wide-band lasers, primarily for the purpose of restricting laser oscillations to a single frequency. Their frequency selectivities are compared in terms of their loss discrimination against the nearest unwanted mode, by evaluating the transmission-loss fraction via the open port of the beam splitter with a given number of axial modes in a free spectral range of the mode selector. Vernier-type interferometric resonators, in which the straight and folded cavities are of nearly the same length, are found to have substantially the same selectivity when they have an active element in the common arm [1] as when they have active elements in one or both of the two branch arms [2]. Resonators in which one of the coupled cavities is much smaller than the other [3] have considerably better selectivity, with up to four times as much loss discrimination against the nearest unwanted mode, because of the greater frequency separation between noncoincident eigenmodes of their decoupled cavities. The ring-laser counterpart of each version has the same frequency-selective properties with twice as much internal gain."
"Presents the back cover of the periodical issue."
"Mode coupling can occur if the gain of a laser is modulated by a frequency near the axial-mode spacing. This modulation is produced by a second laser acting partially upon the same active medium. Mode coupling and intensity pulsations close to the frequencyc/2 [(1/L_{1}) - (1/L_{2})]were observed, in a good agreement with the theoretically calculated waveshapes."
"The output properties of an electrically pulsed CO2laser have been investigated as a function of partial gas pressure and discharge voltage. The output pulse became sharper with increasing CO2pressure. The output pulse energy increased with increasing helium pressure up to a pressure where the output became independent of further increases. Output pulses of 24 joules at 3.6 MW and 3.6 percent efficiency were obtained at 1/10 atmosphere in a 3.5-meter-long 5-cm-bore laser tube."
"Bragg reflection of light from a phase grating has been used as a technique for the investigation of nonlinear optical phenomena. A continuous argon ion laser was used to probe the structure induced in a liquid by the nonlinear interaction of a high-intensity ruby-laser beam with that liquid. This arrangement had the advantage of allowing direct space and time-resolved measurements of the induced effects."
"Picosecond pulses focused on an aluminum foil in a vacuum produced high-velocity negatively charged clouds that were detected on a grid. This is interpreted as an electron cloud recoiling from the radiation pressure."
"A simple, reliable high-current indium cold cathode for pulsed ion lasers is described. Currents in excess of 2000 amperes and pulse durations of 10-2second have been obtained. Pulse repetition rates and operational lifetime appear to be limited only by the dynamics and lifetime of the discharge tube."
"The spectral distribution of the output of a pulsed HF laser shows evidence of cascading from the\\upsilon = 2level to the ground state. Both calculations and experimental results indicate gain coefficients of 1 cm-1at HF pressure of 1 torr."
"A lenslike glass fiber guide with a parabolic variation of refractive index has been developed. This optical guide named SELFOC® has the following characteristics: simultaneous transmission of laser beams modulated by wide-band signals through narrow space; optical image transmission; realization of a lens with tiny aperture or with extremely short focal length; and the possibility of being bent with a small radius of curvature without spoiling transmission characteristics. In the case of a typical fiber guide with length 1 meter and diameter 0.3 mm, transmission loss is about 0.2 dB and depolarization is about 20 dB at wavelength 0.63μ. The mode pattern of a laser beam after passing through the fiber guide is scarcely deformed. The fiber guide can be used as a transmission line or lens, in optical communication, optical data processing, and optical instruments."
"We present a discussion of the threshold condition for the optical backward-wave parametric oscillator, taking into account diffraction due to the finite transverse extent of the fields, and using three transverse modes of both the forward- and backward-wave fields. The coupled differential equations are solved numerically, and the threshold is obtained by minimizing the pump field with respect to the parameters of the forward- and backward-wave fields. Denoting the confocal parameters byb_{1}, b_{2}, and b3for the backward, forward, and pump waves, respectively, and if the length of the crystal is 1, we find that for1/b_{3} \\geq 2, we may setb_{1} = b_{2} =b_{3}. For most purposes, the phase-matching condition may be taken ask_{2} = k_{1} + k_{3}. Also, when calculating the threshold, it is adequate to consider only the two lowest order transverse modes of the forward-and backward-wave fields."
"Using a passivelyQ-switched ruby laser, operating in a single axial and transverse mode, sparks produced in a number of gases at pressures ranging from 760 to 9000 mmHg have been studied. Breakdown threshold measurements for both single and multimode laser radiation have been made and in addition, the characteristics of the sparks produced with single-mode radiation have been investigated. Photography at 90° of the scattered laser light showed the existence of scattering regions with transverse dimensions not exceeding the 5-μ resolution of the optical system. Furthermore, a large amount of laser light is scattered in the forward direction. The intensity, angular distribution, and spectral characteristics of this scattered radiation have been determined. Various possible mechanisms that could account for these phenomena are discussed, and it is concluded that self-focusing of the laser beam after the initiation of the breakdown process may be occurring."
"This paper provides a review of papers published on laser interaction with solids, from the point of view of plasma production. The material is divided into one section dealing with theoretical work and one dealing with experiments. In addition, an extensive bibliography of papers published on the subject up to the end of 1968 is presented."
"Optical distortion in a repetitively pulsed, passively mode-locked Nd:YAG laser system, resulting from laser-pulsed heating of the liquid dye, has degraded the amplitude uniformity of the output pulse trains at repetition rates greater than 1 pps. This correspondence describes a Nd:YAG system in which a flowing mode-locking dye cell is used. The effect of flowing the dye is to remove the thermally distorted volume of liquid before the incidence of the next pulse train. This procedure has resulted in pulse trains of uniform amplitude at rates limited only by the power supply, i.e., 20 pps."
"New CW laser lines from CdII at 8067 and 8530 Å and from ZnII at 4912 Å have been observed in a transverse-discharge configuration. The most probable excitation mechanism is by charge-transfer collisions with He buffer gas."
"Electrostriction is a cause of laser beam self-trapping and damage in transparent glass. It predominates over other self-focusing mechanisms, such as Kerr effect or thermal self-focusing, under certain conditions. This paper shows that self-focusing can occur even if the laser pulse is so short that no steady state is achieved, provided the pulse power is large enough. In the steady state, the threshold power for self-focusing is independent of beam size. In the transient region, the threshold power increases and becomes proportional to the square of the initial beam radius, in the limit of large radius beams or short pulses. The theoretical trapping threshold derived here is less than typical experimental thresholds for track formation in glass."

"We have derived expressions for the field induced in a thin-film waveguide by plane waves incident upon an adjacent frustrated total reflecting interface. From these, we have deduced an expression for the coupling coefficient for a Gaussian TEM00beam into such a guide as a function of the guide and beam parameters."
"Using two Pockels cells, a single-picosecond-duration light pulse generated by a mode-locked Nd:glass laser was time synchronized with a 50-100-ns-durationQ-switched ruby-laser pulse. The picosecond pulse was reliably placed in the early part of the rise of theQ-switched pulse, and could be delayed to any later time."
"The properties of the rhodamine 6G flashlamp-pumped circulating dye laser with cyclooctatetraene and cycloheptatriene as triplet-state quenchers are described. Particular attention is given to such observables as pulse duration, frequency sweep, and early termination of the laser pulse. From the experimental results and the theory of dye lasers, it is concluded that the thermal effects may not play a dominant role in such lasers."
"An analysis of the saturable absorption of SF6at 10.59 μ is presented. A model for the absorber is developed and experiments have been performed to determine the value of the saturation parameter. It is shown that at pressures above 0.1 torr, the saturation parameter varies linearly with the pressure and is governed by the relaxation time of the lowest level ν6. Effects of temperature on the absorption are discussed."
"Two techniques are described for obtaining information about the intensity correlation function of an optical field, from measurements of photoelectric counting distributions. The first method is based on double differentiation of the second factorial moment with respect to the counting time. It requires very accurate data, but is shown to be quite feasible, and yields the intensity-correlation function explicitly. The second procedure is less sensitive to inaccuracies and allows the correlation time and certain other parameters to be determined from the factorial moments. In addition, it yields some information about the general form of the correlation function, but no explicit function. The procedures are illustrated and compared by application to photoelectric counting measurements of a laser far below the threshold of oscillation."
"Reduction of CO2-laser-induced thermal lensing in liquid CS2by the application of a dc electric field is reported. The electric field is found to destroy the effect of natural convection on the thermal lens and induce convection patterns dependent upon field orientation that enhance heat transfer and reduce the negative lensing effect. The experimental results are found to be consistent with calculations of electric forces present in fluids with a radially decreasing electrical conductivity."
"A new general analysis for mode-locked operation of a homogeneously broadened laser with either internal phase (FM) or amplitude (AM) modulation is presented in this paper. In this analysis, a complex Gaussian pulse is followed through one pass around the laser cavity. Approximations are made to the line shape and modulation characteristics to keep the pulse Gaussian. After one round trip, a self-consistent solution is required. This yields simple analytic expressions for the pulse length, frequency chirp, and bandwidth of the mode-locked pulses. The analysis is further extended to include effects of detuning of the modulator, in which case analytical expressions are obtained for the phase shift of the pulse within the modulation cycle, the shift of the pulse spectrum off line center, the change in pulse length, and the change in power output. Numerical results for a typical Nd:YAG laser are given. In the case of the FM mode-locked laser it is found that there is a frequency chirp on the pulse and that this causes pulse compression and stretching when the modulator is detuned. Etalon effects and dispersion effects are also considered."
"In Part I of this paper [1], a theoretical analysis of the mode-locked homogeneous laser was given. In this part we present experimental results for the Nd:YAG laser with internal phase modulation. LiNbO3was used as the modulator crystal, and a method to measure the single-pass phase retardation of the modulator accurately at 1.06 μ is described in detail. The pulsewidth and spectral width of the mode-locked laser were measured as a function of depth of modulation, and good agreement with theory was obtained. Etalon effects in the laser were observed, and the results agreed very well with the theory. Mode-locked spectral bandwidths of up to 16 GHz, implying mode-locked pulses as short as 40 ps, were obtained."
"Linear krypton and xenon flashlamps (6-mm bore, 3-inch arc) having various fill pressures between 450 torr and 4 atm have been operated in a single elliptical gold-plated pump cavity to excite a Nd:YAG laser rod (0.25-inch diameter, 3 inches long). Here we describe laser operation as a function of lamp fill, for electrical input energies ranging from 2 to 40 joules (120-μs pulse duration) and for pulse repetition rates from single shot to 20 Hz. We have found that Kr lamps are generally superior to Xe lamps for pumping Nd: YAG except at high current densities. Specifically, for this system (the parameters of which are suitable for commercial and military applications), the optimum Kr fill pressure is approximately 700 torr, while the optimum Xe fill pressure is roughly 1000 torr. The threshold with the 700-tort Kr lamp is 58 percent of that with the 1000-torr Xe lamp; the crossover energy (for equal absolute efficiencies) is 40-joule input, which in our system corresponds to about 375-mJ output."
 "Continuous operation of a sealed-off CO2laser oscillator has been achieved over a period of one year. The power output of the oscillator at the conclusion of the test was 4.1 watts compared to its original power of 6.5 watts."
"The FM-laser or frequency-sweeping mode of laser oscillation has been demonstrated in a Nd :YAG 1.06-μ laser with an intracavity LiNbO3phase modulator. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical expression\\Delta= (\\Delta\\Omega/\\Delta\\nu) (\\delta/\\pi)where δ= peak single-pass phase retardation in the modulator,\\Delta\\Omega= axial mode spacing,\\Delta\\nu=modulator detuning, and Δ=resulting FM index of the laser output. Modulation indices as large as\\Delta \\approx 230rad have been obtained, in which case the instantaneous laser frequency is sweeping over a full spectral range of2\\Delta \\cdot f_{m} \\approx 120GHz (≈ 4 cm-1) at a repetition frequencyf_{m} \\approx 260MHz, with a time-bandwidth product per period\\approx 2\\Delta \\approx 460. The coherently mode-locked spectral bandwidth thus obtained in the FM-laser case is very much wider than can be achieved in the pulsed mode-locked case with the same Nd:YAG laser. Some possible ways of using this broad-band coherent FM spectrum are suggested."
"The Nd:glass laser has become one of the most useful sources of light pulses a few picoseconds in duration. In this paper, we review the results of an extensive study of the time and spectral structure of the Nd:glass laser radiation. The time structure was studied by means of two-photon fluorescence (TPF) patterns: these were scanned by a very thin (28-μ) cell containing the fluorescent dye, the fluorescence being monitored by a photomultiplier. When the Nd:glass laser isQswitched by a rotating mirror or when it is free running, we find TPF patterns fully consistent with a model where the laser emission has the character of Gaussian noise (thermal light), i.e., a model where the modes are randomly phased. When the laser was simultaneouslyQswitched and mode locked we made two observations : 1) the TPF patterns show that the ultra-short pulses observed previously have an overall duration of ∼8 ps, but also possess an internal substructure containing peaks 0.4-0.8 ps in duration; 2) the spectral width of these pulses is <20 cm-1at the beginning of theQ-switched train and expands to ∼80 cm-1in the middle of the train. This rapid spectral broadening during pulse buildup is attributed to self-phase modulation in the laser glass matrix due to a nonlinear index n2which we evaluate asn{2}= (2 \\pm 1) \\times 10^{-22}m2/V2(or1.8 \\times 10^{-13}esu). Gain limiting due to this effect and self-focusing become very important at power densities above 1 GW/cm2, presenting a serious limitation on the energy density (J/cm2), which one may hope to extract from Nd: glass laser systems."

"The influence of statistical amplitude or phase variations in the modes of a mode-locked laser on the time-dependent output intensity and on the relative efficiency of nonlinear optical processes is investigated. The ensemble-averaged intensity, the time-dependent distribution of the resulting complex amplitude, and the second-order moment of the intensity distribution are calculated and discussed for both types of variations. As long as no systematic amplitude or phase changes are introduced, the pulse shape is maintained, but superimposed on a fluctuating background, and the efficiency for nonlinear optical processes is reduced. For random phase fluctuations over 2π the pulse behavior disappears completely and the output becomes Gaussian or chaotic light."
"A continuously pumped Nd:YAG laser has been repetitivelyQswitched with a vibrating mirror at repetition rates up to 10 kHz. Peak powers of 70 kW and pulsewidths of 60 ns have been observed. TheQswitch is comprised of a mirror attached to one end of a torsional rod driven at its mechanical resonance frequency."
"Pulses of 100 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM) have been displayed on a direct current to 5-GHz real-time oscilloscope. The 100-ps duration includes contributions from the oscilloscope, the photodetector, and the laser pulse,Maximum current in the linear regime of the photodiode is ≈3 amperes so that electric pulses of ≈70 ps FWHM and ≈150 volts can be obtained with the laser-detector combination. Results of a simple optical method for determining the exposure time of high-speed electronic cameras are also briefly given."
"Observation of eleven unknown spontaneous spectral lines explains the appearance of corresponding laser lines."
"The variation of pulsed laser threshold with temperature is graphically presented for YAG: Er3+, Tm3+, Ho3+over the range from 90 to 300°K. The active ion is Ho3+and threshold for the 2.13-micron line varies between 4 and 60 joules over this temperature range."
"Observation of continuous self-mode-locked pulses induced only by the nonlinearity of the laser medium is reported for the 10.6-μ CO2, 3.39-μ He-Ne, and 3.508-μ He-Xe laser transitions. Optical spectra of these pulses were taken with a scanning Fabry-Perot intefferometer. Attainment of self-locking was strongly dependent on the second-order spatial Fourier component of the excitation density in the optical cavity."
"Continuous-wave oscillation has been observed on a number of P-branch transitions belonging to the (001)-(100) bands of CO2 and N2O induced by the transfer of vibrational energy from vibrationally excited CO. The CO is excited in an electric discharge and mixed with cold CO2 or N2O in an optical cavity using a longitudinal flow system (~75 m/s). Comparison is made to the analogous N2-N2O and N2-CO2 systems and several implications and applications are discussed."
"Experiments with a CO2-N2-He multipass laser having a movable-end mirror are described. At constant mirror velocities ranging from 0.5 cm/s to 40.0 cm/s, pulsing was observed with repetition rates between 1-60 kHz and with apparent peak-pulse amplitudes of 10 times the CW output. Measurements were made for various cavity optical path lengths."
"Laser action was observed on six more lines of ionized xenon."
"The interaction between an intense focused beam of optical photons and matter in gaseous form at low pressure (10-3torr) brings into play some strongly nonlinear processes. These multiphoton processes occur through the simultaneous absoprtion of several quanta by an atom that may be thus either excited or ionized. The orders of nonlinearity of the interaction of a multimodeQ-switched laser beam with rare gas atoms were measured with laser intensities up to 1013W ċcm-2at 1.06μ and up to 1012W ċcm-2at 0.53μ. The energy of the number of quanta corresponding to the order of nonlinearity is always close to the energy of an atomic level. The results seem to emphasize the particularly important role performed by bound states during the ionization process. Thus a two-stage ionization process seems far more probable than a single direct transition between the ground state and the continuum spectrum. Experimental values of multiphoton ionization probabilities are also given after having precisely determined the spatiotemporal intensity distribution function."
"Sinusoidal perturbations are applied to the resonator of a CW Nd3+:YAG laser to study the response of the system. Two kinds of resonances are observed. The resonant AM mode exhibits a sinusoidal modulation in the output and its frequency is determined by the pumping power and cavity losses. The spiking mode shows a train of regular pulses and its frequency is constant. Nonlinear coupled rate equations are solved to show solutions in good agreement with the experimental observations. The effect of nonresonant perturbation on the output is also presented."

"Several spectral coincidences between carbon-monoxide laser emission lines and absorption lines of NO and N2O4have been observed, and absorption measurements have been taken. These data are presented and discussed along with similar spectral coincidence observations made previously using the helium-neon and iodine lasers. Other coincidences between CO-laser lines and NO2absorption lines are predicted from a study of recently available high-resolution-spectroscopy literature. Due to the narrow line widths of gas-laser lines, the coincidences reported here can be applied to the selective sensing of these constituents in the atmosphere."
"Several important characteristics of optical parametric oscillators can be substantially improved by nonresonantly reflecting the pump wave back upon itself after it has passed through the nonlinear medium. Benefits are reduced thresholds, decreased buildup times, and improved efficiencies. Steady-state analyses of doubly and singly resonant oscillators are presented."
"We analyze second-harmonic generation (SHG) with focused pump beams in the high-conversion regime where pump depletion is significant. Numerical solutions of the coupled equations for pump and harmonic fields are obtained for the cylindrically symmetric case of collinear phase matching. The optimum values of phase mismatch and confocal parameters σ andbfound by Boyd and Kleinman are very nearly independent of pump power to above 95 percent conversion. When phase mismatch is not optimized, the best confocal parameter depends upon the input power. The conversion efficiency versus input power is determined numerically for optimum\\sigma, b, and approximate analytical formulas are given for this relation."
"The mode-locking behavior of a homogeneous laser with an intracavity FM modulator changes rapidly and asymmetrically when the modulation frequency is detuned by small amounts from its optimum value. We develop here a simple analysis of these detuning effects. The analysis gives explicit expressions for all aspects of the mode-locking behavior as functions of detuning. A physical interpretation of the analysis also makes clear which physical mechanisms are responsible for the detuning behavior."

"The use of wide-bandwidth interdigital microwave circuits to provide electrooptic modulation of light is discussed. Two models employing lithium niobate crystals of different aspect ratios have been constructed and tested. Both have nominal bandwidth from 1.0 to 2.0 GHz but actually give somewhat greater modulation bandwidth. Single-pass modulation tests made using 6328-Å light at RF drive power level of 5 watts show that 30 percent modulation depth over a 1.5-GHz frequency band is obtained for one model while approximately 50 percent modulation depth over a 1.1-GHz band is obtained for the other. These results show excellent agreement with analytical predictions. Measurement techniques are also discussed."
"A scheme for the direct display on a low-frequency oscilloscope of periodic subnanosecond optical pulses from mode-locked lasers is described. Low-power pulses can be displayed since no optical elements nonlinear to the power are used. Initial results with mode-locked He-Ne lasers are given."
"A theoretical model is presented that satisfactorily describes intermediate stages of the propagation of laser-induced plasmas created by focusing laser light on air and other materials. Two stages can be distinguished during the intermediate phase of the plasma expansion. The first is an approximately linear stage, of high speed, governed by the group speed ofX-ray photons absorbed in the plasma's vicinity. The second is a hydrodynamic expansion with anX-tdependence of the formX \\alpha At^{1/3}used to account for the slower motion of the plasma front behind the blast wave (R \\alpha Bt^{2/5}). Our theoretical model is compared with results of a particular experiment that best fits the conditions of the theory."
"The results of electron-beam experiments on undoped single-crystal CdS are presented. A description of the beam-injection apparatus is given. The relevance of various indications for lasing in this type of structure is discussed, and an operational definition of lasing threshold current is described. In this paper intensity versus pumping carves, stimulated-emission moding curves, and measurements of the frequency- and time-dependent characteristics of the stimulated emission from undoped CdS will be presented and discussed. New data show that there is a 1.1 Å/ns shift of the stimulated peak emission to longer wavelengths which is independent of the pumping current density. This effect is not understood but is crucial to the understanding of the CdS electron-beam-pumped semiconductor laser."
"A water vapor laser has been operated with a subsidiary grating Fabry-Perot resonator replacing one end mirror. Double-wavelength operation was obtained. Single-wavelength operation was obtained with strong rejection of shorter wavelength radiation, a variable effective reflectivity of the end mirror, and control of polarization characteristics of the cavity, allowing linear or circular polarization."

"An iteration technique is used for a theoretical study of the field distributions and diffraction losses at the reflectors of an asymmetric confocal cylindrical resonator having an output hole in one mirror for the low-loss TEM00and TEM10modes with Fresnel numbers ofN = 0.8and 1.2. A digital computer is used to numerically iterate an initially launched uniform distribution as it reflects back and forth between the mirrors until a steady-state field distribution occurs. The edge and coupling hole diffraction losses and the power coupled from an output hole in one mirror are also computed. The presence of the coupling hole produces a perturbation of the field distribution with distortion of the field increasing for increasing Fresnel number and for low-order modes. The relationship between hole radius and power output is presented. An optimum-size coupling hole may be selected from this data, which will yield maximum power output in the mode of operation desired. It has been found that, with the use of a coupling hole, mode selection of the lowest order TEM00mode is possible for resonators having large Fresnel numbers (N > 1.0)."
"The thermal and optical properties of CW Nd:YAlG laser rods have been measured before and during optical pumping with tungsten lamps. Instabilities in the optical properties during pumping were found to correlate reasonably well with the fluid flow characteristics of the coolant used. The importance of stable optical properties to the attainment of maximum laser radiance and amplitude stability is emphasized. Estimates of the mean temperature rise and profile in the rod during pumping are given."
"An analysis of the interaction of ultrasonic waves with the junction-laser modes is performed, using first-order perturbation theory. It demonstrates that in the presence of sound waves, each laser mode is frequency-modulated with negligible harmonic distortion or mode mixing. It is also shown that bandwidths of several GHz, with high-modulation index are possible."
"A parametric study has been undertaken to determine the gain characteristics of flowing CO2-N2-He lasers employing a transverse-discharge configuration. Unlike conventional cylindrical discharge tubes, in this device the gas-flow and electrical-discharge paths lie perpendicular to the optical axis. Box lasers with various aspect ratios and electrode configurations were evaluated. The gain exhibited an inverse dependence upon the height of the box laser. The axial gain in the Faraday dark space is lower than in the region of the positive column, decreasing monotonically to zero at the cathode. The character of the axial gain profile is significantly changed by a reversal in the direction of gas flow relative to the polarity of the discharge. For a volumetric gas flow of 0.3 scfm, a peak gain of 3.4 dB/m was attained with a box laser characterized by 1/2-inch height, an 8:1 aspect ratio, and a 1-inch adjacent electrode spacing. Power output data are presented for a box laser employing a folded optical resonator."
"It is shown how intracavity etalons can be optimally designed for axial mode selection and frequency stabilization of gas and crystal lasers. Relevant laser parameters, required etalon properties, and expected losses are determined. A simple frequency stabilization scheme based on birefringent etalons is described, which does not require laser modulation. Major problems associated with stable single-frequency operation of solid-state lasers are discussed. Using an optimally designed crystal quartz etalon, a Nd:YAG laser could be stabilized to 10-7in frequency and 2 percent in amplitude. The linearly polarized single frequency TEM00output was 150 mW, which compares to an unpolarized 12-mode output of 400 mW for the bare laser."
"A method for stabilizing the frequency of a single-J- value CO2laser to the center of its output power versus frequency curve based upon the variation of the impedance of the plasma tube with the optical power extracted is described. Frequency modulation of the laser produces an ac component of voltage drop across the plasma tube, which is synchronously detected to generate a frequency-error signal."
"Laser emission has been observed at 54 wavelengths between 11 and 41 μ in pulsed electrical discharges in BF3, BCl3, and BBr3. The emission wavelengths have been measured and the time behavior of the lines studied. Lasing in each of the gases produces total peak powers on the order of 10 to 100 mW. The addition of N2, He, or H2O to the discharge is found to have considerable effect on the peak powers of various lines and on the total energy emitted. The observed wavelengths are consistent with pure rotational transitions in HF, HCl, and HBr. Some short wavelength lines in the1.5-6 \\muregion are also observed but do not appear to be associated directly with the far-infrared emissions."
"The behavior of a He-Ne laser amplifier in the presence of an axial magnetic field has been studied experimentally by measuring Faraday rotation and gain for various values of input signal intensity. Two high-gain transitions in the 3.39-μ region were used for study-aJ = 1toJ = 2transition and aJ = 1toJ = 1transition. Theoretical expressions have been developed, which included the nonlinear effects of saturation strength signals. Experimental results clearly show saturation of Faraday rotation; in addition, for theJ = 1toJ = 1transition, a Faraday rotation reversal and a traveling-wave magnetic field dip are seen. These results match the theoretical predictions and provide a method for measuring the upper (3s2) level quadrupole moment decay rate."
 "Three-wave parametric interactions are studied in media exhibiting group-velocity dispersion. Under certain conditions these interactions may be described by the same equations that govern pulse propagation in a two-level resonant system. This analogy suggests the existence of steady-state pulse solutions in the three-wave parametric system. Such solutions are found, and are analogues of pi and two-pi pulses. The variety of solutions in the parametric system is greater than in the resonant case."
    "-An intensity-dependent electrooptic effect of ZnTe is measured in detail. The decrease of r41by a factor of 50 has been observed at a 50-Hz modulation. Above 100 kHz, r41does not depend on the intensity. This effect has been applied to an optically controlled light modulator."
"When helium is added to argon, the relative peak intensity of the 4880-Å pulsed argon-ion laser scarcely decreases even at high currents whereas in pure argon it decreases remarkably after saturation. It is supposed that the changes of the neutral atom and ion densities contribute to the phenomenon."

"The 890-GHz line of a HCN laser has been phase-locked to a frequency standard. The technique, which is applicable to any laser frequency that can be reached by mixing with known frequencies, will allow frequency measurements of lasers to at least parts in 109."
   "Measurements of the noise temperature in theLband were used to investigate the effect of several constituents of the gas mixture on the discharge properties of the CO2laser. Addition of He and H2O to the discharge gives no significant change in the temperature. By contrast, addition of 4-torr N2to 2-torr CO2increases the noise temperature from 1.3 to 1.5 eV. Increase of the current in an optimum CO2-N2-He-H2O mixture leaves the temperature nearly constant (1.5 eV). This result deviates from that of Tyte and Sage, who found an anomalous rise of noise temperature with increasing current. Within the 5 percent experimental error the radiation temperature does not depend on laser action. A comparison of the present results with those of probe measurements is given. It is concluded that He has practically no influence on the average electron energy, which in turn controls the vibrational excitation. This and the observed behavior of the output power as a function of the partial He pressure give strong evidence that the major role played by He is cooling the gas in the discharge."
           "A series of diagnostic experiments was undertaken in order to gain some understanding of the physical processes occurring in the high-power directly excited CO laser. These included studies of the UV and visible sidelight for a directly excited and flow-type CO laser; a comparison of various gas mixtures for laser operation at 77 and 195°K wall temperatures; a study of the laser spectral output as a function of cavity (wavelength-selective and free-running) operational mode (CW or Q-switched), gas pressure, and discharge current; and a measurement of the laser recovery time. Some of the more important conclusions of these experiments were that a CO-N2-O2-He mixture is superior to CO-N2-He or CO-O2-He mixture at 77 and 195°K; that freeze-out of O3and CO2is an important phenomenon at 77°K; and that both rotational and vibrational cross relaxation appear to be occurring in the CO during CW lasing. Also a discussion of three possible inversion mechanisms is included. An inversion based on the V-V cross-pumping theory of Treanor et al. [16] appears to be most consistent with our experimental results."

"Two methods of information storage in a holographic memory device are discussed: consecutive storage of individual binary numbers on the same hologram, and parallel storage of masses of binary numbers on individual holograms. Optical setups of respective memory devices are described. Experimental results of the investigation of these setups are presented."
"The effect of inserting an element exhibiting induced absorption into aQ-switched laser cavity is investigated theoretically and experimentally. The rate equations are solved assuming two types of nonlinear loss, one being proportional to the square of the laser intensity and the other being proportional to the product of laser intensity and density of excited electrons in the nonlinear absorber. Experiments are performed with a rotating-prism ruby laser with a CdS crystal in its cavity. It is established that two-photon absorption takes place, and as predicted by the theory that the output intensity and output energy both decrease and pulse length increases as compared with the normalQ-switched case. In addition, the output pulse has an oscillatory behavior, and it is suggested that this is caused by loss due to the excited electrons, which are found to have a lifetime of approximately 24 ns."
"A new method is proposed for measuring the widths, and possibly even the detailed shapes, of picosecond pulses in CW mode-locked lasers. The pulses are passed through an electro-optic modulator, which is biased for zero transmission with zero applied voltage, and which is driven at a harmonic of the pulse-repetition frequency. The variation in average light transmission through the modulator is monitored while the relative phase between the light pulses and the modulator drive is varied. The pulsewidth may be deduced from one such measurement made at a microwave light-modulation frequency sufficiently high that the pulsewidth is a finite fraction of a period at the modulation frequency. By making such measurements at a number of harmonics, the complete Fourier expansion (including both amplitudes and phases) of the picosecond pulse envelope can, at least in principle, be determined without ambiguity."
"An analysis of optical second-harmonic generation internal to the laser cavity is presented. It is shown that the maximum second-harmonic power generated in this way is equal to the maximum fundamental power available from the laser. Further, it is found that there exists a value of nonlinearity that optimally couples the harmonic out for all power levels of the laser. The magnitude of the nonlinearity required for optimum coupling is shown to be proportional to the linear losses at the fundamental and inversely proportional to the saturation parameter for the laser transition. For the YAlG:Nd laser at 1.06 μ using Ba2NaNb5O15as the nonlinear material, the required crystal length for optimum coupling is given byl\\min{c}\\max{2}(cm)\\simeq 2.7 \\times 10^{2}L/fwhereLis the linear round-trip loss andfis the ratio of the fundamental power density in the nonlinear crystal to that in the laser medium. For low-loss cavities, optimum coupling can thus be achieved for crystal lengths of 1 cm or less. The use of a mirror or mirrors within the cavity, reflecting at the harmonic, is considered as a means to couple out the total harmonic in one direction. Considerations of temperature stability and the finite oscillating linewidth of the laser are shown to favor a configuration with a single harmonic mirror located on the same surface as the fundamental mirror."
"Guide lines are presented for the selection of promising new acoustooptic materials for device applications. Previously, the selection of materials was based primarily on availability and intuition. Now it is possible to estimate an approximate acousto-optic figure of merit for a material knowing only its chemical composition and density. One of the first applications of these guide lines led to a detailed evaluation of lead molybdate, PbMoO4, a material known to have certain desirable physical properties. The results verified that PbMoO4has a high figure of merit, considerably greater than LiNbO3though somewhat less than α-HIO3. In addition to a high figure of merit, a material must also have a low acoustic loss if it is to be useful for device applications. The relationship between the acoustooptic figure of merit and acoustic loss is explored. Although only limited loss data are presently available, it is concluded that a high figure of merit and low loss are compatible material properties for applications below approximately 0.5 GHz. However, as future applications call for higher frequency operation, it appears that a tradeoff between low acoustic loss and high figure of merit will be required."
"A mechanism of laser triggering of spark gaps in which laser-produced ions play the dominant role is investigated for several electrode materials. Spark channels due mainly to laser-produced electrons and channels due mainly to laser-produced ions are clearly distinguished by high-speed shadowgraph techniques."
"The 890-GHz line of a HCN laser has been phase locked to a multiplied standard frequency with a wide bandwidth phase-lock loop. Due to the wide bandwidth loop, linewidths of the beat between the laser and the multiplied frequency standard have been narrowed to less than 50 Hz."
"An experimental study of noncritically phase-matched (\\theta_{m} = 90\\deg) second-harmonic generation is described, in which the theoretical predictions of Boyd and Kleinman with regard to strength of focusing and effect of mismatch are closely verified. Radiation at 1.084 μ from a He-Ne laser was employed to generate light at 542 nm in LiNbO3."
"The saturated gain constant of the carbon dioxide laser is calculated using a thermodynamic approach. At low electron densities the gain constant is found to saturate according to a well-known and simple function. At higher electron densities, however, a more complicated form is assumed. The calculations are found to agree well with measured saturated gain."

"The existence of excited-state absorption of 1.06-μ radiation in transitions from the upper laser level upward (4F_{3/2}-4G_{9/2}) is suggested by the ground-state absorption spectrum of Nd3+in soda-lime glass. The strength of this absorption was measured as follows. In the unpumped material the upper laser level was populated at high temperatures (600 and 783°K) by saturating the laser transition with an intense 1.06-μ probe laser beam. The residual absorption was attributed to4F_{3/2}-4G_{9/2}transitions. The steady-state saturation behavior was calculated on the assumption of rapid spectral cross relaxation, using spectroscopic data appropriate to the elevated temperature. Comparison of theoretical and experimental saturation behavior yielded an effective excited-state absorption cross section equal to one-third the gain cross section of the laser transition. This sizable value may be expected to have a significant adverse effect on laser threshold and efficiency. Also, it provides a mechanism for internal fracture such that the fracture threshold decreases with increasing neodymium concentration and with increasing temperature."
"The time relationship between the 1st Stokes, 2nd Stokes, 3rd Stokes, 1st anti-Stokes radiations, and the exciting laser radiation for stimulated Raman scattering in self-focusing liquids has been investigated theoretically and experimentally. A model is presented for calculating the output power and time behavior of the different orders of Stokes radiation when self-focusing occurs. Experimentally, good agreement is found between predicted and measured output powers, but some apparent anomalies are observed in the time behavior for the 2nd and 3rd Stokes radiations and 1st anti-Stokes radiation, especially in carbon disulfide. There are strong indications of dielectric breakdown occurring in the liquids, and it is shown qualitatively that the observed time behavior of the higher order Stokes radiation can be caused by the dielectric breakdown."
"The normal modes of an anisotropic laser resonator containing an intracavity Faraday rotator have been investigated. Below a threshold value of rotation, the Faraday cell rotates the electric field vector of the linearly polarized modes. Above this value, each axial mode splits into two elliptically polarized waves. The frequency difference of these modes is then dependent on the Faraday rotation angle. Experimental results obtained using a 3.39-μ He-Ne laser with two Brewster windows and a YIG intracavity Faraday cell are in agreement with the results calculated from a normal mode analysis."
"A flashlamp-excited organic liquid laser system capable of stimulated emission down to 340 nm in the ultraviolet has been developed. The flashlamp has a rise time of 50 ns and energy capacity of 20 joules or more. There are several efficient laser compounds that emit below 400 nm, and the most promising appears to be the p-terphenyl laser, which emits at 341 nm and is capable of running in the superradiant mode. There are several interesting facets still unexplained in ultraviolet lasers. The possibility of singlet to triplet intersystem crossings in substances generally accepted as having unity fluorescence quantum efficiency has been encountered."
"An upper limit of 4 ns has been determined for the nonradiative relaxation times between the4T2and2T1states of ruby. This value was deduced from the rate of rise of the red2T1fluorescences from ruby crystals pumped by the second harmonic of a 1.06-μ laser."

"The optical losses of \"close-confinement\" (single heterojunction) epitaxial injection lasers fabricated by liquid-phase epitaxy (LPE) have been described in terms of a simple waveguide model. Experimental and theoretical comparisons were made of LPE lasers with identical impurity profiles except for the addition of the AlxGa1-xAs p+-p heterojunction (\\DeltaE_{g}\\sim 0.1eV) within1-2 \\muof the p-n junction. This reduces the room-temperature absorption loss and hence the laser threshold-current density. The values of the internal laser loss α at 300°K range from 20 to 40 cm-1, while in the homojunction LPE lasers α is typically close to 100 cm-1. The laser gain coefficient β in the close-confinement lasers ranges from 3 to6 \\times 10^{-3}cm/A; values of\\sim3 \\times 10^{-3}cm/A. are estimated in similarly doped homojunction LPE lasers. However, β in diffused lasers is known to be substantially lower,\\sim \\leq 10^{-3}cm/A. We believe that substantial electron confinement exists in the homo-junction LPE laser because of the doping discontinuity at the p+p interface, which is absent in the diffused lasers. Thus, the β values are correspondingly lower in the diffused lasers. The addition of the (AlGa)As heterojunction does not, apparently, increase the electron confinement greatly as compared to homojunction LPE lasers when the active region width is about 2 μ (the optimum value for overall laser performance) for a given doping level. Values of the exterior differential quantum efficiency of 43 percent are obtained at 300°K in close-confinement lasers, which means that most of the light internally generated is emitted. Because of the reduced internal loss, the spontaneous exterior efficiency is also greatly increased by the addition of the heterojunction (a factor of 2-3). State-of-the-art values of the threshold current density of the optimum structures are 10 000 A/cm2for a cavity length of 20 mils, with values of 8000 A/cm2in exceptional units. A power conversion efficiency at 300°K of 10 percent has been measured, which agrees with the theoretically predicted value. It is noteworthy that the diode series resistance is unaffected by the addition of the heterojunction. The laser characteristics have been studied as a function of varying acceptor concentration, donor concentration, and bandgap energy discontinuity at the p+-p interface. Semiquantitative agreement for the laser loss between theory and experiment at 300°K and 77°K is obtained for an active region width of\\sim 2 \\mu, using reasonable values of the index of refraction differences between the various laser regions and free carrier losses. The major difference between simple waveguide theory and experiment is in the dependence on the width of the active region. Instead of a decrease in α with increasing width, the opposite occurs in the range investigated because the theory is not applicable when the width of the active region substanfially exceeds the minority carrier diffusion length. Furthermore, higher order mode propagation has been neglected. Such modes have been experimentally observed whend \\cong 5 \\mu. The addition of the heterojunction greatly reduces the laser loss due to light leakage from the active region into the p+ region. The contribution to the laser loss resulting from leakage into the n-type side of the junction is small. It is unaffected, of course, by the addition of the heterojunction. This loss could be further reduced by use of a double heterojunction structure. Based on the theoretical results and comparison with experiment in which the Zn concentration is changed,it is concluded that the dominant loss is due to free carrier absorption (holes mainly) in the active region of the close-confinement lasers. Thus, it is not expected that the laser-loss coefficient will substantially vary with the cavity length. However, in the homojunction LPE (or diffused) laser this may not be the case. There the refractive index difference\\Deltanbetween the p+ and active p region is relatively small; hence, small variations in\\Deltandue to increasing the laser photon energy by decreasing the cavity length may substantially reduce the optical waveguiding effect. Finally, we note that work in progress indicates that close-confinement lasers are capable of long-term operation (2000 hours) with power reductions of 20 percent or less when operating at a current density of 50 000 A/cm2(0.04 percent duty cycle). However, it is known that the laser life depends on the imperfection density in the active region. Hence, the metallurgy of the device is a key factor that must be carefully controlled in laser fabrication. In particular, dislocations can be introduced as a result of the slight lattice mismatch at the (AlGa)As-GaAs interface."
"The spectra of the spontaneous emission from GaAs laser diodes fabricated by vapor-phase epitaxy and containing a high degree of compensation in the p-type side of the junction are, in many respects, similar to those previously reported for the cathodoluminescence of homogeneous p-type material. The temperature dependence of the spectra of these diodes supports a model where the emission is attributed to radiative transitions between a narrow band of states near the conduction-band edge and an exponential distribution of states extending the valence band into the forbidden gap. An increase in temperature then results in an increase or a decrease in the radiative power output depending on the position of the quasi-Fermi level for electrons relative to the above narrow band of states and a distribution of nonradiative levels below it."
"In Parts I and II of this work [1], [2], the resonant modes of GaAs lasers, as predicted from a proposed model, are found to be in very good agreement with experimental results that emphasize the frequency domain. This paper, Part III, supplements the previous work by investigating the spatial field distributions of junction-laser beams. For the first time, the propagation characteristics of the beams are described mathematically in a manner that is consistent with detailed beamwidth measurements in the Fresnel and Fraunhofer regions of the diffraction field. This correlation between theory and experiment is made possible by the use of a lens-slit combination that ensures the generation of reproducible beams with rectangular symmetry. The astigmatic beam solutions describing the propagation characteristics beyond the slit include beam-broadening effects produced both by the lens and by phase variations at the laser mirror, along the junction plane. These latter variations have not been previously reported. Their existence is deduced from our measurements beyond the slit, which show a greater beam expansion along the junction plane than can be theoretically accounted for by the lens system alone. Near threshold, at a distance of one beamwidth from the center of the mirror illumination, the phase lag is found to have a current-dependent magnitude of a few degrees."
"The second harmonic of pulsed GaAs injection lasers was generated with the nonlinear crystal α-iodic acid (HIO3) phase matched by angular tuning. The injection laser was operated with an external cavity, and the HIO3crystal was placed inside the cavity to increase the conversion efficiency. The maximum harmonic power observed was 15 μW with a fundamental power of 4.5 watts inside the cavity. Since the lasing bandwidth was typically 30 Å and the calculated bandwidth for collinear harmonic generation was only 6.3 Å, a grating was used to narrow the lasing bandwidth to 3 Å. The expected large increase in harmonic power did not occur. It is shown that this is due to sum-frequency generation by laser modes lying outside the harmonic bandwidth. It is also found that the spectral width of the harmonic becomes bigger than the collinear bandwidth when a divergent laser beam is used."
"An external cavity coupled to a conventional Fabry-Perot GaAs diode laser operating continuously has been found to cause modulation of the light output at a frequency within the range 0.5 to several GHz. The modulation depth is close to 100 percent and the linewidth can be made as narrow as 180 kHz. The modulation is thought to be stimulated by the intensity noise fluctuations, which peak at the well-known spiking frequency fr. The oscillations are strongly enhanced by a frequency locking action of the external cavity, being efficient when the external cavity round-trip time2L/c, or a multiple thereof, corresponds to the inverse of the spiking frequency. Since the latter is dependent on both pump current and temperature, the system can simply be tuned by adjusting the pump current. For a fixed resonator length, the narrow-band oscillations occur in a small current range, in which an increase in frequency with increasing current at a rate of 400 kHz/mA is observed. A small-signal analysis based on simple rate equations shows the influence of the external cavity on the intrinsic resonance frequency fr. It demonstrates that self-modulation can only occur for small values of the coupling coefficient ε between the laser diode and the external cavity."
"Self-induced intensity pulsations of continuously operating GaAs injection lasers have been frequency stabilized and narrowed by applying to the laser microwave feedback signals derived from the electrical and optical outputs of the laser itself. The width of the optical pulses has been reduced to less than 180 ps at a pulse rate whose spectral width was simultaneously reduced to less than 30 kHz. Significant differences between electrical and optical methods of feedback are demonstrated and discussed."
"Heterostructure lasers have been made by growing an epitaxial p+layer of GaAlAs onto an n+-GaAs substrate. The p-GaAs active region, formed by diffusion of zinc into the substrate during the growth process, is about 1.6 μ thick. Threshold current densities of these lasers lie between 8000 and 12 000 A.cm-2at 300°K, depending on the cavity length. External incremental quantum efficiencies are about 40 percent and change very little with cavity length. It is found that the gain coefficient is a superlinear function of current and the loss coefficient appears to vary with cavity length as a result of the variation in photon energy, which occurs with different threshold currents. The threshold currents of the heterostructure lasers are a factor of 4 lower than previous homojunction lasers. The conclusion is drawn that the improvement is largely a result of the carrier confinement that occurs at the heterojunction. Some improvement can be related to a reduction of optical losses but it is a consequence of the superlinear gain-current relationship that even a loss coefficient of zero would be insufficient to explain the low-threshold currents."
"Average optical output powers in the 5-watt range from GaAs arrays emitting peak powers of 500 watts at 10 kHz have been built for ground illumination and ranging. The thermal optical design for accomplishing this performance at 77°K is shown. The arrays described are3\\frac{1}{2}inches in diameter and weigh 2 pounds. Overall efficiencies approaching 30 percent at 101°K and 40 percent at 77°K have been achieved. Without adjustment other than lens focus, overall tolerances of 0.1° in alignment have been shown by the use of straight, rectangular light pipes. Output beams of2\\deg \\times 6\\deghave been obtained with beam uniformities of less than 10 percent."
"The influence of electron energy on the characteristics of electron-beam-pumped GaAs lasers is studied experimentally. Increases in the electron energy lead to increases in output power and decreases in beam divergence. Above radiation-damage threshold, a degradation of the laser output with time is observed due to bulk defects created by the beam. These defects are partially self-annealing if radiation is stopped."
"Optical pump experiments on homogeneous samples provide a method of obtaining a clearer understanding of the details of laser action in semiconductors. For this reason, the quantum-mechanical rate equations for a bulk semiconductor laser that explicitly include a monochromatic light field as a pump source are developed. The theory treats general optical transitions and is valid for both pure and doped homogeneous semiconductors. The developed theory gives the intensity of the laser output in the entire region from below to above threshold as a function of the intensity and frequency of the pump field, the temperature, doping level, and material constants. Also the variation of the laser light frequency at threshold upon these parameters is given by the theory. Information about the dependence of the necessary pump intensity and frequency for threshold is gained. The theoretical calculations are compared with experimental measurements and found to be in general agreement."
"Electrical and light emission characteristics of pulsed InAs p-n junction lasers, prepared by diffusing Zn into Sn-doped n-type crystals with a substrate concentration of 1018cm-3, were studied at 4.2, 20.4, and 77°K. Data of variation of capacitance with bias showed these to be abrupt junctions. At injection currents below threshold, the temperature independence of the slopes of the I-V characteristics and the observed variation of the integrated light intensity with current suggest the injection mechanism be photon-assisted tunneling. The peak of the spontaneous radiation shifts with the applied voltage in the expected manner. The time-resolved laser spectra are seen to shift to longer wavelengths during pulsed operation of the laser. The line shift results from joule heating of the junction, and follows the variation of bandgap with temperature. From a plot of threshold current density as a function of reciprocal length gain and loss factors have been calculated. An independent value of the gain factor was obtained from the observed variation with current of the superradiantly narrowed linewidth from a nonlasing structure. Mode-confinement studies indicate that the mode confinement is due to the optical gain in the junction region."
"Experiments with stripe-geometry lasers show that Byer's results for degradation of pulsed diodes can not be generalized to CW conditions. Diodes subjected to CW injection-current density of8 \\times 10^{3}A/cm2show very little degradation after close to 1000 hours of operation at room temperature."
"The current procedures that are employed in the design and fabrication of high-peak-power room-temperature GaAs laser arrays are presented. The methods of material selection and heat-sink preparation are illustrated. Specific mention is made of the laser-chip packing densities that produce effective laser-array brightness in the 100 kW/cm2region. Actual arrays have been constructed that produce 1 kW peak power with 400 amperes peak of modulator current at 1 kHz, or 600 watts peak at 300 amperes peak at 5 kHz. For modulator-current pulses less than 35 ns, these arrays can be expected to operate for 1010pulses. For field-lens apertures only a few inches in diameter, beam divergences from these arrays of only a few milliradians can be realized. Data relating the power output as a function of pulsewidth, repetition rate, and modulator current for several array configurations are presented. Differential quantum efficiency and overall power-efficiency data and curves are illustrated for typical diode and array configurations. The schemes employed to select and interface various optical components necessary to produce the desired beam divergences from reasonably sized apertures are discussed. Brief mention is made of the parameters of the laser-junction radiation densities necessary to maximize the array operating lifetime."
"Frequency modulatlon or a semiconductor laser via ultrasonic waves is achieved at a modulating frequency\\omega_{m} - 150MHz for CW operation at 4.2°K. Individual sidebands are resolved whose variation with pressure agree well with theory, indicating that little distortion is present. A modulation index of 6 is achieved corresponding to a frequency deviation of 900 MHz and an acoustic pressure of 3 atmospheres. Under pulsed operation at 4.2°K and 77°K frequency modulation is observed as a blurring of the laser frequency."
"The spontaneous and stimulated absorption spectral functions are calculated using a band model consisting of a tail part given by Halperin and Lax, a parabolic part above the tail, and an optical model with an energy-dependent matrix element and no selection rule for the radiative transitions. The use of a parabolic band above the tail is justified since a second-order perturbation calculation shows negligible distortion of the band in this region. The parameters associated with the densities of states are determined self-consistently, involving no adjustable constants. Contrary to the generally accepted assumption and the results of Stern's calculation using Kane's density of states of a long and reasonably large-state density in the conduction-band tail, it is shown that the tail is negligibly small compared to the valence-band tail. Therefore, it is concluded that, for a typical laser, the electron quasi-Fermi level at threshold above 77°K should be in the parabolic portion of the conduction band instead of in the tail as is usually assumed without justification. The energy dependence of the matrix element is that for the average parabolic conduction band to an acceptor-level transition and should be a suitable one due to small conduction-band tail and the population of most of the holes in the vicinity of the acceptor ionization energy. General properties such as the gain current relationship and the temperature dependence of current and carrier quasi-Fermi levels are compared with those calculated without band tails and with band tails given by Kane's model. Considerable difference in each case is found and discussed. The calculations of the temperature dependence of the threshold current and the current dependence of the super radiance spectra are then applied to GaAs diffused diodes with substrate doping of3 \\times 10^{18}cm-3, taking into account the temperature dependence of the cavity loss and the nonuniform accepter distribution in the p layer. Detailed comparison with experimental data is made and good quantitative agreement is obtained in either case, showing strong support to the conclusion on the band-tail structure. The approximations of using the linear screening and Gaussian statistics that were employed by Halperin and Lax, and Kane to obtain analytical expressions for the densities of states used in Stern's calculation are discussed."
"Measurements of threshold-current density and incremental efficiency on homostructure and heterostructure GaAs lasers show an increasingly superlinear dependence of gaingon current densityJwith increasing temperature. The indexnin the relationg \\propto J^{n}satisfies the relationn = [1 + (kT/E_{t})^{2}]^{1/2}where Etis a measure of the band-tail depth."
"It is well known that a magnetic field modifies not only the photon energy, but also the threshold current required by semiconductor lasers. However, the extent to which a given field modifies this threshold current depends very strongly upon temperature and on the lifetimes of the carriers in the valence and conduction bands. Theoretical calculations that predict values of threshold current as a function of magnetic field in mixed-crystal Pb1-xSnxTe lasers are presented. The carrier lifetimes in these materials have recently been studied in some detail and turn out to be related to the composition of the material and to its preparation history. Assuming that the carrier Lifetimes are largely determined by the acoustical phonon density or by random distribution of short-range scattering centers, the Kubo formalism can be used to express the individual Landau-level densities of states. From these, the quasi-Fermi levels at any pumping rate can be directly calculated. Fork-conserving transitions, the optical density of states is then determined by a convolution integral method recently reported elsewhere, and the threshold current is computed numerically by the method of Lasher and Stern. Using some of the measured values of carrier mobilities given by Calawa et al., for compositions withx = 0.07andx = 0.20, and using the measured values of Butler and Harman for zero magnetic-field threshold to adjust the gain requirement parameter, threshold currents at 77°K are computed for magnetic field strengths up to 250 kG. Curves are obtained that predict a threshold current for the higher mobility material that decreases by a factor of about 3 with increasing magnetic field out to the vicinity of 10 kG, flattens out, and then slowly increases. For the lower mobility material, an overall higher input current is required; however the curve continues to decrease to 25 kG before flattening out and then beginning to rise."
"The differential external quantum efficiency ηextof Fabry-Perot-type GaAs injection lasers has been measured as a function of the mean reflectivityR. By evaporation of antireflective films,Rhas been varied between 0.25 and 0.06. The observed increase of ηextwith decreasingRis interpreted in terms of a simple model. Values for the optical losses α, the gain factor β, and the internal quantum efficiency at 77°K are obtained for individual diodes."
"The effect of population inversion on the index of refraction in semiconductors is calculated. A simple model of the absorption edge is modified to include the effects of population inversion. By correlating the density of states in the conduction band with the absoption edge, a modification of the absorption edge occurs because of the filling of states in the conduction band. The effective density of hole states in the valence band is neglected because the density of states in the valence band is much larger than the density of states in the conduction band. When the exponential tail in the conduction band is filled to an energy Ef, a propagating electromagnetic wave does not attenuate for energies below Efdefined as the quasi-Fermi level for electrons in the inverted region. No attenuation occurs because electrons in the valence band can not be excited to the filled states of the conduction band. For a wave with an energy above Ef, band-to-band transistions are allowed because of vacant states in the conduction band. Therefore, for waves with energiesE = h\\omega > E_{f}, the absorption process is the same as the absorption process for a material without population inversion. Free carrier effects are neglected. The change in the index of refraction is calculated for various slopes of the band tails and for various values of Fermi levels below the nominal-band edge. The results show that at low temperatures there is a positive contribution to the index for energies slightly below the Fermi level. At energies much less than the Fermi level, the contribution to the index of refraction is negative. At absolute zero, the crossover between a negative contribution and a positive contribution to the index isE_{t} = E_{f} - 0.3725E_{0}where E0is the slope of the conduction-band tail. As the temperature increases, the value of Etincreases. The magnitude of the index of refraction change increases as the slope E0increases."
"The first experimental observation of the excitation of the natural resonance of a semiconductor laser by the quantum fluctuations intrinsic to the laser is reported. Such excitation and the resulting resonant-like peaks in the microwave noise spectrum of the laser intensity were initially predicted by McCumber and later calculated in detail for semiconductor lasers by Haug. In addition, we present experimental and theoretical results that show that high-level excitation of the resonance by internal or forced modulation of the population inversion lowers the resonant frequency due to the nonlinearity present in the rate equations. In the experiments to be described, intensity noise spectra of continuously operating GaAs injection lasers were observed at microwave frequencies with a high-speed photodiode and a microwave spectrum analyzer. Because of the low level of the photocurrent produced by these fluctuations, it was necessary to reduce the intrinsic noise level of the system by using phase-sensitive detection techniques. In this way, the following experimental observations have been made. First, a sharp peak in the intensity noise spectrum has been observed at currentsIfrom 1.5 to 100 percent above threshold (Ith). Second, at constant heat-sink temperature, the frequency of the peak varies, with current as(I/I_{th} - 1)^{1/2}. Third, while the intensity fluctuations relative to the square of the laser intensity continuously decrease (by three orders of magnitude) with increasing current, the absolute value of the noise peak increases (by more than two orders of magnitude) to a maximum value that is maintained with further increases in current. Finally, the frequency of the noise peak at constant current level above threshold shows no variation with heat-sink temperatures between 80°K and 150°K. The above observations were made on lasers in which the resonance was not strongly excited by combination tones present in the active medium and consequently for which there were no deep intensity pulsations. For lasers in which the intensity spontaneously pulses, the resonance peak has also been observed at currents very near threshold. However, in these diodes, the frequency at the peak increases with current as predicted by the theory only over a small range near threshold. Beyond this range, the resonance is excited by the combination tones, causing the frequency to decrease to a minimum value before increasing farther as the current is increased. Such behavior can be qualitatively understood in terms of the decrease in the average inversion (and consequently a reduction of the resonant frequency), which accompanies the self-induced pulsing of the laser intensity. Computer calculations based on nonlinear rate equations have confirmed this behavior."
"Self-induced sustained pulsations have been observed in the light output from GaAs injection lasers with tandem double-section stripe geometry. The pulsing behavior of the laser is analyzed using a repetitivelyQ-switched model similar to that of Basov. Exact numerical solutions to the nonlinear rate equations have been obtained, which are to be compared with our experimental results and with the results in the earlier work of Basov et al. An approximate approach using a phase-plane analysis is described, which yields a simple way for the determination of the regions of excitation currents that leads to the sustained pulsing solution."
 "An experimental and theoretical study has been made of the radiation patterns from GaAs lasers with a \"close-confined\" structure. The lasers were grown by liquid-phase epitaxy and consisted of a p+ - p-n structure with Al in the p+ region. Photometric measurements were made of the intensity distribution at the emitting facet (microscope observations) and the radiation pattern in a plane perpendicular to the junction. The electromagnetic field distribution in the vicinity of the p-n junction and the radiation pattern were calculated by solving the wave equation for a three-layer structure with complex dielectric constants in each layer. The theory predicts enhanced confinement of the radiation by the increased dielectric discontinuity due to the heterojunction, in agreement with the low lasing threshold and high efficiencies of the close-confined diodes. Another consequence of the theory is that as the thicknessdof thepregion of the cavity is increased, higher order modes can propagate with efficiences much greater than in ordinary lasers without the heterojunction. The third mode, corresponding to three intensity maxima along a line perpendicular to the junction, was observed ford = 5 \\mu. The good agreement found between the observed and calculated radiation patterns indicates that confinement of the radiation by dielectric discontinuities is an important factor in explaining the low-threshold currents found in close-confined lasers."
"Efficient internalQswitching and delay effects are observed in a range of temperatures from less than 100 to 400°K in solution grown GaAs-GaxAl1-xAs heterostructure injection laser diodes. The characteristic transition temperature Ttabove which long stimulated emission delays are found, decreases with the laser cavity length (i. e., higher threshold current density). Ttalso decreases with the thickness of the active region. The onset of hole injection seems to occur simultaneously with the appearance of the pronounced delay andQ-switching effects."
"The conditions for bistable operation of CW GaAs junction lasers are developed in terms of the previously published double-acceptor trap theory. The experimental CW operation of such devices is shown to agree well with the theoretical results. In addition the fabrication of these bistable lasers is described and several pulsed experiments are reported that indicate a significant increase in the number of trapping centers in the vicinity of the junction."
"The effect of injection modulation on CW GaAs junction lasers undergoing coupled mode pulsations at microwave rates is studied. Two types of behavior are observed depending on the values of the power and frequency of the modulating signal: either fractional-harmonic locking to the modulating signal or pulse repetition rate modulation."
"The determination of the nature of optical laser transitions is one of the basic problems of semiconductor laser physics. It was shown earlier in certain mixed CdSx-CdSe1-xcrystals that in the case of intense dipole-allowed exciton absorption, the indirect exciton transition provides the principal channel for laser action using free excitons with the assistance of optical phonons at relatively high temperatures and using bound excitons at relatively low temperatures. In the present work new evidence is reported on the above CdSx-CdSe1-xcrystals as well as on other II-VI compounds (ZnSx-CdS1-xand ZnSe-CdSe), enabling conclusions about the characteristics of the oscillations produced by the complex phonon spectra of mixed crystals. Lasing of the above crystals was produced by optical two-photon pumping using a ruby laser. Experimental results showed that with two-photon pumping involving excitons in crystals of CdS, CdS-CdSe, ZnS-CdS, and ZnSe-CdSe, lasing can be obtained at temperatures no higher than120-140\\degK. When the temperature is not too low (T \\geq 60\\degK), the laser action always preceeds by means of free excitons interacting with LO phonons. At lower temperatures than 50°K most of the crystals lase on bound excitons, with or without the involvement of optical phonons, depending on the spectral distribution of losses. In two cases (CdS and ZnS0.09-CdS0.91) atT < 50\\degK, the lasing occurred on transitions of the Auger recombination type involving excitions. The mechanism of laser action is a strong function of temperature. An important feature of mixed crystals is the dependence of the phonons involved on the composition of the samples. This dependence was studied in the CdS-CdSe crystals. These crystals have a complex phonon spectrum; they are characterized by two types of longitudinal optical phonons, LO1and LO2whose intensity ratio is dependent on the crystal composition. For crystals in which one of the components is dominant at 77°K, it is shown that the oscillation occurs via free excitons with either the LO1or LO2longitudinal optical phonon more intense. For crystals with comparable concentrations of their components, both LO1and LO2phonons take part simultaneously in the lasing process (two-phonon transitions)."

"A system gain of 40 dB was realized with a semiconductor injection-laser oscillator operating into a neodymium-glass-fiber laser amplifier. InAsP ingots were grown by a modified Czochralski technique. The injection laser was fabricated from a mixed crystal of InAs0.17P0.83. This composition was chosen because laser emission occurs at 1.063 μ at liquid nitrogen temperatures. The p-n junction was obtained by zinc diffusion under phosphorus pressure. The method of fabricating contacts and the Fabry-Perot cavity is described, and optical and electrical characteristics of the devices are given. Coarse tuning of the lasing wavelength is based onx. Fine tuning can be accomplished by temperature variation of the laser junction in accordance withd\\lambda/dT = 1.6Å/°K between 80- 140°K. The injection laser was optically mated to the samarium-clad neodymium-glass-fiber amplifier by microscope optics and a gimbal-mounted reflector. Design details of the optical amplifier are given in context with optimum low-noise-level operation. The peak optical amplifier wavelength can be varied over a 100- Å interval by appropriate choice of the host-glass composition. The injection-laser pulse was delayed until the spontaneous emission had reached its peak for a maximum observed gain of approximately5 \\times 10^{4}."
"A junction laser in which the light propagation within the device is along curved-junction paths is reported here. Path curvatures with radii ranging from 0.25 to 1.00 mm were obtained by the intentional introduction of curved diffused junctions. It was found that for radii of curvature smaller than a critical value of about 0.4 mm, the threshold-current density increases very rapidly. This value is in good agreement with the theoretical value, which is obtained by assuming that the gradient of the refractive index across the GaAs junction determines the minimum bending radius for low-loss propagation. The design of these curved-junction devices is critically dependent on the suppression of lasing along undesired junction paths perpendicular to the desired direction by bending these paths through a smaller than critical radius."
"In recent years a number of powerful methods have been developed that treat quantum fluctuations in ordinary lasers. Among these are quantum mechanical Langevin equations and ac-number Fokker-Planck equation associated with quantum systems. First, the quantum mechanical Langevin equations for the semiconductor laser are shown. Then the extension of the Fokker-Planck method to multimode action in semiconductor lasers is given, and then the exact stationary solution, which predicts the relative probability of mode configurations. In particular the Paoli-Ripper model that treats in a combined way the intrinsic resonance of a single-mode semiconductor laser and the effect of nonlinear polarization is discussed."
"The detailed properties of \"close-confinement\" LPE (AlGa)As junction lasers have been studied in the Al composition range where the alloy has a direct bandgap transition. It has been shown that the laser efficiency is essentially independent of wavelength at 300°K between 9000 and 8000 Å. This is important in applications where photocathodes are used to detect the laser radiation or where optical pumping of Nd:YAG laser is desired. Continuously operating red-emitting lasers at 77°K (6635 Å) have also been fabricated. At room temperature, the lowest threshold current density, 8300 A/cm2for low Al content, (x \\leq 0.1) is only slightly higher than in GaAs, which is indicative of the excellent metallurgical properties possible in this alloy system. An external differential quantum efficiency of 43 percent at 300°K (x \\leq 0.1) nearly equals the best GaAs laser value. Furthermore, the relatively low series resistance in these devices makes possible power conversion efficiencies of ∼10 percent at 300°K and ∼50 percent at 77°K. The variation of the laser threshold currents and efficiency with increasing Al content is very close to the theoretically predicted variation based on the change of the internal quantum efficiency, assuming a direct-to-indirect bandgap energy transition at 1.92 eV. This suggests that the best devices perform very nearly at their theoretically predicted maximum in relation to present similarly constructed GaAs lasers."

 "The dynamics of a feedback-controlled Nd:YAG laser are examined. By introducing feedback-loss control in a Nd:YAG scan laser, the undesirable transient behavior of theQ-switching operation is avoided, increasing the switching speed of the scan laser up to the megahertz range."
"Additional excitation mechanisms, apparently overlooked in [1], but previously reported to be responsible for the selective excitation of the Hg II7p2P_{3/2}upper state of the 6150-Å laser line in mercury-helium lasers, are referenced and discussed. It is pointed out that asymmetric charge transfer and Penning-type ionization reactions can also account for the selective excitation of the Hg II7p2P_{3/2}state as well as direct electron impact excitation from the Hg I ground state."
"In the present work we have investigated the mechanism of rotational transition competition of a single-mode laser by studying the effect of small variations of the out-coupling loss factor. For this purpose we used on the out-coupling side one extra mirror with a reflectivity of only 1 percent. In this way the instability problem could be followed with a controllable out-coupling device having a variable reflectivity between 73.6 and 81.5 percent and a corresponding variation in out-coupling loss factor. Due to the nonzero rotational relaxation time we find a narrow range of the gain-to-loss ratio of respective transitions to have nonsingle oscillations. We have observed single as well as multioscillating transitions as a function of the loss factor."
"The behavior ofQ-switched laser-pulse shapes caused by various optical nonlinearities within the optical resonator is treated with an extended version of the Statz-de Mars equations. The importance ofQ-switch time behavior together with optical nonlinearity is shown by means of waveforms calculated at selected values of essential parameters, and good qualitative correspondence with a wide variety of relevant experimental observations is reported. A method of estimating some of the qualitative effects of parameter variations is described, providing an alternative to computer calculations when full details are not required."
"An experimental comparison of the pulse and group velocities in a self-pulsing ring laser is presented. It is found that the two velocities are essentially equal near laser threshold, and the group velocity exceeds the pulse velocity by an increasing amount for increasing laser excitation."
"Modulation of a CO2laser with a Stark cell internal to the cavity has been achieved with very low voltage and capacitance requirements-100 V/cm for 50 percent modulation and 50 percent absorptions with a capacitance of the order of 10 pF."
"Output and threshold characteristics of small-bore pulsed xenon ion lasers are presented in detail as a function of current and gas pressure for ranges of these parameters that are consistent with high optical power output in the green-blue spectral region. It has been found that six wavelengths characteristic of xenon exhibit peak output powers greater than 100 watts, from a 5-foot laser tube over a limited (8-24 mtorr) range of xenon tube pressure. Laser action has also been obtained at high peak powers for longer current pulse (5-50 \\mus) operation of the tube. In addition, observation of three new laser wavelengths 5340, 5501, and 5590 Å is reported. These lines are only observed at very low tube pressures and very high peak currents."
"A simple intracavity polarization-modulation technique is described that shows promise of producing nearly 100 percent amplitude modulation of laser output through the use of a relatively low-voltage electrooptic birefringent modulator. Some preliminary performance data are presented that support the general feasibility of the technique and indicate the direction that should be taken toward its further development. Although the technique is generally applicable to any CW laser system, it would appear to be particularly useful with the CO2laser since good electrooptic modulators are not available for that laser."

"Experimental studies are presented of the random fluctuations of the laser light and of the diode current of continuous-wave multifilament GaAs laser diodes. Using the single-detector method, the intensity noise of the laser light of single, optically isolated filaments is measured in the central measuring frequency range 40 kHz-6 MHz. In the same frequency range, the intensity noise of the total laser light from one emitting face is also measured. The intensity noise of the laser light is found to depend strongly on the generation of lasing filaments in the p-n junction. The noise of the electrical excitation current depends also on the filamentary action. The laser-light noise and the current noise are correlated. The cross-correlation coefficient is measured between 40 kHz and 6 MHz as a function of the excitation current. The discovered correlation allows the application of a noise-modulation method to the laser light, which leads to a reduction of the laser-light noise-to-signal ratio."
"Experiments are reported that measure the pulse velocity of a mode-locked 6328-Å He-Ne laser pulse in a resonant absorber as a function of the pulse intensity. At low intensities, pulse velocities greater than the velocity of light in the passive medium are observed. These results are compared with a simple theory based on the saturation of the dispersion associated with the absorption. At higher intensities where the pulse approaches a 2π pulse, pulse delays (that is pulse velocities less than the velocity of light in the passive medium) are observed."
"An analysis of the photoconductive gain-bandwidth product and SNR is presented, which allows a comparison of microwave-biased and dc-biased extrinsic detectors. The results of an experimental comparison using mercury-doped germanium at 10.6 μ are described. For equal bandwidth of 70 MHz, the measured gain and detectivity were better by a factor of 35 for microwave biasing compared to dc biasing."
"The effect of quenching of metastable triplet states upon the efficiency of organic dye lasers is considered in detail by solving the coupled differential equations describing the laser process. It is shown that specific quenching agents for excited triplet states can 1) cause a dramatic increase in the laser efficiency, 2) negate the previous requirements of very fast pumping sources, and 3) permit the use of dyes with relatively small fluorescence quantum yields. The addition of quenching agents that quench both singlet and triplet states (such as molecular oxygen) generally improves the efficiency although not as dramatically. Steady-state solutions were developed that lead to analytical expressions for the laser efficiency and the concentrations of the excited states as a function of time."
"PassiveQswitching of the CO2laser in the 10.6-μ region using C2H4gas and in the 9.6-μ region using CH3OH vapor is reported."
"A new method of absorption measurement of liquids is presented. This method takes advantage of the shift in beat frequency between a strong Gaussian mode, forming a thermal lens in the liquid, and a weak first transverse mode acting as a probe to detect the thermal lens. The light absorption coefficients of the liquids are directly related to the beat frequency changes that are measured on an RF spectrum analyzer. The approach is general in that it can be used to measure the focal length of any weak lens. It appears to be more sensitive by nearly an order of magnitude than the methods that measure change in spot size."

"We examine the nonlinear dynamics of the turn-on of aQ-switched laser (or maser) oscillator. The description of the laser is fully quantal, including fluctuations. We use the coherent state representation for the field, and treat the atoms adiabatically. We obtain for the first time an accurate analytical solution for the distribution, which describes the probability, in an ensemble of identically prepared lasers, that the field intensity has a certain value at a certain time after the initiation of theQ-switch. The most easily observable fluctuation effect is a timing jitter in the turn-on, amounting to about two and one-half times the time constant, which describes the early exponential rise of the field intensity. An example is presented, using parameters approximating those of a 1-mW helium-neon laser."

"A 50-kV laser-triggered spark gap operated at repetition rates to 50 pps is described. Jitter of delay time as low as ± 0.1 ns was demonstrated. Dependence of delay and jitter was investigated as a function of gas mixture, pressure, laser power, and electrode material. Subnanosecond jitter was obtained with as little as 0.17 mJ in a 6-ns giant pulse from a Nd+3in a YAG laser. The dielectric gases used included a high proportion of Ar mixed with N2or SF6."
"In a sealed-off CO2laser, deposits are formed from the gas mixture. The removal of the gas in this way limits the lifetime of the laser. Fragments of these deposits are analyzed mass spectrometrically and their possible composition is given. After the discharge tube was pumped down, the gases released from the walls were analyzed. CO2was observed and it was apparently trapped at the walls."
"Results on the simultaneous initiation of four high-voltage spark gaps by a single moderate power laser system are presented. AQ-spoiled YAG laser irradiated each of four 50-kV spark gaps with 10-20 mJ energy in a 7-ns pulse full-wave at half maximum (FWHM) by use of simple beam-splitting techniques. Synchronization of ∼ 0.1 ns at repetition rates as high as 50 pps was demonstrated both on electrically well-isolated switches as well as on switches connected in parallel with less than 1-ns time isolation. A unique synchronization indicator is described for use as a performance diagnostic."
"The general theory of double resonance in gas lasers is used to deduce analytic expressions for the intensity of a laser oscillating on aJ = 1toJ = 0atomic transition, and experimental data on the1.52-\\mu (2s_{2} - 2p_{1})transition in the He-Ne laser are reported. Phenomenological modification of the theory is introduced to account for the pronounced effect of collision broadening upon double resonance. Atomic parameters of the2s_{2}level of neon are obtained by comparison between theory and experiment. The collision-dependent decay rates introduced in the theory are also obtained, and the functional dependence of the theory upon the decay rates is examined."

"This paper describes a new method of angle measurement by optical means that may prove useful in gyrocompass applications. In this device, the relative orientation of the spin axis of a transparent spherical rotor is determined by measuring the Fresnal drag effect associated with the motion. This is done by placing the spinning sphere in the path of the optical beam inside the cavity of a ring laser and measuring the beat frequency between the oppositely traveling waves as a function of the spin-axis orientation. Differential sensitivities greater than 105Hz/rad are easily obtained with this technique. In this paper, experiments with this device are described and sources of error are pointed out. By carefully constructing such a device, it should be possible to determine the direction cosines of the rotor axis angle to an accuracy of a few parts per million."
"From an investigation of the fluorescence and laser tunability of 7-N-methylamino-4, 6-dimethylcoumarin, we have found a convenient means of extending the laser bandwidth and tunability by acidification of the solution.

"A three-level model of a two-photon absorber is set up, and the response of the system to a pulsed excitation is calculated, including the effects of homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening. The results are applied to the two-photon absorption-fluorescence (TPF) mesurement technique and it is shown that the larger of the two broadening mechanisms sets an upper limit to the spectral width of pulses, for which an unambiguous interpretation of the TPF display can be made. Effects that occur when this condition is violated are discussed."

"An investigation of the propagation properties of a short pulse in a resonant absorber with a homogeneously broadened transition is presented with two main questions in mind: 1) the influence of the input pulse area on the transitory regime and on the steady-state propagation; 2) the effects of atomic coherence on the pulse shaping and the time delay of the leading edge of the pulse. The transitory regime of a propagating pulse is investigated and the stability of some asymptotic wave form confirmed. As expected, the transversal relaxation mechanism affects critically the major features of the coherent interaction. A detailed analysis of this problem is also presented."
"The thermally induced stress birefringence has been known to severely affect the performance of a solid-state laser system when the beam is linearly polarized. This paper refines the theory of the interaction of a linearly polarized wave with a continuously pumped YAG : Nd crystal; in conjunction with experimental evidence this paper illustrates the angular independence of the birefringence, describes the radial dependence, and explains the laser power losses involved."

A collision-broadening frequency of1.6 \\pm 0.1 \\times 10^{8}second-1at 15 torr, 293°K, and a transition lifetime of 2.2 ± 0.2 seconds are obtained. A saturation intensity of about 2 mW/cm2for 1 torr of DME is also estimated."
"An amplifier for 10.6-μ radiation of a CO2laser has been constructed using the negative glow of a hollow-cathode discharge. The single-pass gain of 10 percent per meter reported here from such a discharge in a CO2-He mixture is less than that realizable in the positive column of a glow discharge used for CO2lasers under comparable conditions.

"Basic characteristics of an electroopticallyQ-switched CO2laser are given in this paper. Studies of the dynamics ofQswitching using this system are compared with solutions of classical rate equations, clarifying the role of various processes in determining the output characteristics.Qswitching was obtained with an intracavity GaAs modulator crystal. Outputs similar to those of other switching techniques are obtained but with greater time control and somewhat greater amplitude stability. The pulse shape and the delay between switching and pulse development are independent of the manner in which switching was obtained, due to the fast ( < 1 ns) switching capability of this technique. Data on the dependence of these parameters on cavity losses are given. Comparison of these data with solutions of rate equations shows that stimulated emission and resonator losses alone are important in early pulse development. However, to describe adequately the entire pulse shape, it is shown that the effect of rotational thermalization in the CO2molecule must be included in the rate equations."

 "This paper considers the synthesis of passive networks with minimum sensitivity to element tolerances through some classes of continuously equivalent transformations. The methods of transformations to be discussed are those transformerless ones in which the port structures of networks are invariant. Two approaches to the problem are to be considered. The first is the procedure in which an additional network is sought such that the augmented network, obtained by the parallel connection of the given network and the additional one, is equivalent to the original one. The second is based on linear transformations discussed by a number of authors. Of practical interest is the choice of transformation parameters that minimizes the sensitivity to element tolerances. The solution procedure to this problem depends on a penalty function approach that converts the constrained problem into a sequence of unconstrained minimizations for which efficient algorithms have recently been proposed."
"The well-known hybrid-\\piequivalent circuit for small-signal representation of junction transistors in the normal domain is extended to cover sinusoidal voltages of large amplitudes. The effective parameters thus obtained as the result of the inherent exponential nonlinearities are expressed in terms of the small-signal parameters and the amplitude. Both resistive and reactive parameters are considered. The proposed effective equivalent circuit serves as the basis for the design of a large class of LC sinusoidal oscillators, mixers, tuned power amplifiers, and harmonic generators, and also as the basis for computing the terminal parameters as functions of amplitude. In the event that small-signal terminal parameters constitute the only data available on the device, a method is given to compute from these data the small-signal hybrid-\\piparameters required for the effective parameters."
"This paper utilizes the effective hybrid-\\piequivalent circuit derived in Part I for analyzing the behavior of tuned power amplifiers. Continuous wave (CW) amplifiers, harmonic generators, amplitude-modulated (AM) class-C amplifiers, and class-B (linear) amplifiers are all analyzed on a unified basis, with particular reference to the device output power, input power, driving power, load impedance, and related quantities."
"A class of filter networks that consists of sections of microstrip transmission lines employing a semiconductor dielectric operating between resistive terminations is investigated. It is shown that the transfer functions of this class of lossy networks can be expressed in the same form as corresponding functions for lossless structures, thus making feasible the application of methods of synthesis already available for lossless structures. A design procedure is presented for the systematic synthesis of this class of networks. The procedure is illustrated by several design examples including both maximally flat magnitude and Chebyshev bandpass filters. Two filters were fabricated using microstrip sections containing a high-loss silicon dielectric. The measured and calculated responses of both filters were in good agreement."
          "A unified scheme for modeling semiconductor devices is presented. The main feature of this scheme is that it can be directly applied to state-variable analysis. A distributed system based on continuity, current-flow relationship, and Poisson's equations is shown to be approximated by a lumped RC network with arbitrary accuracy. By means of this modeling scheme and state-variable analysis technique, a network composed of semiconductor devices is formulated by a set of ordinary differential equations. The lumped RC network contains some C-only cutsets and circuits, which correspond to Poisson's equation and the conservative nature of the electrostatic field, respectively. From these topological structures, a set of state equations of a minimum number of independent variables is systematically obtained. An example of formulating a set of state equations of a twodimensional transistor model is given as are suggestions for applying the modeling scheme to various kinds of semiconductor devices. The modeling scheme proposed can be efficiently applied to the analysis of both the device itself and a network consisting of many devices over a wide range of conditions."
"A multilayer RC distributed network is a2n-port consisting of alternately sandwiched layers of dielectric and resistive materials of uniform width and thickness. The immittance functions of such a network admit canonical forms that lead to equivalent networks consisting of decoupled uniform RC lines. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for a transcendental frequency function to be a network function of a multilayer RC distributed network. The coefficients of the voltage transfer function form a sequence whose sign variation is important in the synthesis."
"A new class of transfer functions approximating a constant group delay that can be realized as transmission factors of doubly loaded transmission-line filters of commensurate line lengths is introduced. The magnitude response obtained is more general than the analogous response of filters having a maximally flat type of approximation to a constant delay. This is due to an additional parameter that may be used to obtain a magnitude response having either better passband performance or sharper cutoff than the maximally fiat type of delay approximation. Explicit formulas for the evaluation of the coefficients of transmission factors of any order n are derived."
"It is shown that a rational basis exists for stating that one network is more passive or more active than another. In fact, a quantitative measure of passivity is developed that assigns to each network a single number that can be calculated in a relatively simple way. This measure is shown to have many of those properties that one would expect on physical grounds. It also allows one to study many fundamental design problems in a rational manner. For example, one now has a basis for designing the maximally lossy loading network that could support oscillations with a given active network."
"Large 1-dimensional (ID) and 2-dimensional (2D) arrays of almost-linear and almost-lossless networks are investigated using the equivalent linearization technique of Kryloff and Bogoliuboff. The active element is assumed to be a distributed cubic nonlinear shunt conductance. It is demonstrated that an arbitrary number of nonresonant (or asynchronous) modes can be stably excited on a 2D oscillator, but only a single mode on a ID oscillator. Experiments confirm that a variety of multimode oscillations, resonant as well as nonresonant, are observed on 2D oscillators but not on ID oscillators."
"This paper considers least-mean-squared-error linear estimation on signals received over a channel that can be characterized by additive noise sources and a time-invariant dispersion network whose transfer function is randomly selected. Solutions for the optimum linear receiver for the problem of continuous waveform estimation of a stationary process (Wiener filtering) and for estimating the amplitude of an isolated signal pulse (matched filtering) are presented and compared with the conventional results for a deterministic channel. The influence of the statistical properties of the channel dispersion on the optimal filter design is illustrated by examples involving particular models for the random channel. The investigation is extended to the situation where the receiver transfer function depends on a finite number of adjustable parameters, these parameters being set according to particular realizations of the channel characteristic. Conditions on the optimal form of this dependence are presented, and typical results are illustrated by an example."
"Explicit formulas are obtained for the state equations of a network in terms of those of its (linear or nonlinear) multiport components and the network graph. Increased generality and simplicity is obtained through the use of the scattering formalism. This allows the inclusion of most nonpathological components without the impedance-admittance hybridization that greatly complicates the common RLC formulations. In both the linear and nonlinear cases a simple test for the existence of state equations is obtained in terms of the properties of a linear memoryless \"subnetwork.\""
"A simple graph-theoretic solution to the Shannon two-person switching game is given. The solution is constructive in that algorithms have been formulated to determine if a game played on any given graph is a short, cut, or a neutral game. The proof makes use of a result due to Kishi and Kajitani, who showed that the edges of any linear graphGcan be decomposed into a partition containing three blocks. From this partition one constructs three graphs that form a principal partition denoted by the ordered triple (D2, G2, H2). It is proved that the game is a short (cut) [neutral] game if and only if a distinguished edge e belongs toG_{2}(H_{2}) [D_{2}]. Strategies for playing each game are given. Finally, duality theory is used to prove that a global strategy exists for a cut game as well as for a short game, where by a global strategy with respect to a short game is meant that the short player can win with respect to any edge spanned by the pair of cospanning trees without knowing which of these edges is the distinguished edge with respect to the game being played."
"A method for numerically integrating differential equations, which permits the user to select an integration step without regard to the time constants of the system, is presented. This results in greatly increased numerical efficiency for systems with a wide range of time constants. The method has the further advantage of not being limited to normal form equations or even to first-order equations. The node voltages (and their integrals) thus form a convenient set of state variables. The method consists of formulating and solving the nodal equations at a set of uniformly spaced points in the frequency domain. A simple Laplace transform inversion scheme is used to convert this frequency-domain data to time-domain data. Near-optimal ordering of the nodal equations, together 'with a Gaussian elimination scheme that performs nonzero operations, only results in efficient operation. A simple numerical example is presented to demonstrate the manner in which the parameters of the method control error."
"The problem of factorizing the transfer matrix is treated in a rigorous way for all lumped finite lossless two-ports, including those containing gyrators and imaginary resistances. It is shown how, for a given order in which the factorization should be realized, all solutions can be obtained in a simple way once an acceptable solution of a certain set of fundamental equations, consisting of a certain numbernof linear homogeneous equations inn+ 2 unknowns, has been found. A simple procedure for establishing these fundamental equations is given."
"A procedure for wide-band amplifier design is developed, based on the use of the base-compensated interstage. The procedure allows the designer to select a suitable transistor using manufacturer's specifications as the basis of selection. The minimum number of stages and the required interstage voltage gain can be calculated with this procedure, which also accounts for noniterative end stages. While the gain-bandwidth product of the base-compensated stage is less than that of certain more sophisticated stages, the simplicity of this stage results in the development of a straightforward design procedure."
"A method of analysis characterized by an exceedingly low number of independent variables is introduced. With this method, it is possible to analyze many networks by using only one or two independent variables regardless of the number of branches or nodes. It is also possible to calculate immittances, transfer functions,n-terminal parameters, andn-port parameters with ease. The advantages of this method over many others can be appreciated when the network contains ideal transformers, independent sources in elementless branches, controlled sources, nonlinear elements, etc. The method is based on the simple idea of scanning the whole network branch by branch. At each step all the independent equations concerning the branch at hand and the previous branches are written. When the last branch is reached, sufficient equations to solve for all the variables of the network become available."
"Although computer-aided circuit analysis has advanced quite rapidly in the last few years, there is considerable room for applications of network theory to the computer-aided design of electronic networks. In this paper the scope of network theory is generalized to include multiterminal networks in which the voltages and currents are related by inequality as well as equality relations. Two classes of new singular elements useful in electronic network design are introduced. The first class generalizes the allowedv-ipairs of a nullator and its multiterminal counterparts. The second constrains the allowed pairs of the norator and its multiterminal counterparts. The new singular elements are used to constrain network variables and to represent bounded adjustable elements. In this way the role of the objectives and element constraints are handled in a unified scheme. By imbedding these elements in a network, the synthesis problem is transformed into a problem of analysis of a circuit containing singular elements. Although the method is applicable to a wide variety of circuits, only the dc linear case is treated here. By keeping a linear formulation throughout, the analysis can be done with linear programming techniques with the corresponding theoretical and computational advantages. On-line programs for interactive time-share use have been written, and their flow charts are given in the paper. They provide a very efficient on-line design system that avoids the iterative analysis optimization approach. The gains achieved in computation time are of several orders of magnitude, and the solutions are guaranteed to be found."

 "The theory of linear (active and passive) networks is investigated from a vector-space viewpoint. It is shown that any linearn-port{\\cal N}can be associated with a linear operatorRand characterized through the kernel or hyperkernel ofR. More precisely,{\\cal N}may be associated with a whole class of linear operators. Some of the corresponding matrices (that will be called \"canonical\") allow a unified treatment for the usual matrix descriptions of n-ports. This also provides a new derivation of the rules for the change of external variables in the description of{\\cal N}, as well as some results about the connectability of twon-port networks."
"A method is developed for determining the maximum response of a system under various constraints of the input. The solution is based on appropriate extensions of the reasoning leading to the matched filter principle. Special cases include a number of problems treated elsewhere. However, the available solutions involve integral equations and the calculus of variations. In the following approach the results are obtained in simple algebraic terms."
    "The expected number of arithmetic operations required to compute the table of factors in the LU decomposition of an nth-order sparse symmetric incidence matrix is shown to increase quadratically with the number of branches incident at any node, but only linearly with the number of nodes. This same result is observed if the sparse incidence matrix is symmetric only in pattern. It is assumed that the same number of branches is incident at every node and that the nodes are ordered randomly."
"A synthesis procedure that can realize any RCrealizable rational transfer function as the open-circuit-voltage transfer ratio of a nonuniform, passive RC distributed circuit is presented. The resulting circuits have a simple, standardized topology and can be readily constructed by thin-film techniques. The synthesis procedure has been completely programmed on a digital computer. From the specification of the transfer function and the electrical properties of the construction materials, the computer produces the complete geometry for the construction of the distributed circuit."
"In this paper, synthesis of distributed RC networks using nonlinear programming is investigated. The Fletcher-Powell minimization procedure is used to minimize the integral squared error. At the same time, the decreasing of the error in the Chebyshev sense is examined in each iterative cycle. One of the main considerations in applying nonlinear programming to a design problem is to find an initial design such that, by iterating it in the frequency range of interest, the iteration is guaranteed to converge to a minimum within a reasonably short computing time. Two methods for finding such an initial design are presented. One is to make an approximation of the given network function in a transformed complex frequency domain. Both approximations are obtained by means of orthogonal functions. The methods presented in this paper may be used for practical distributed RC network applications. Examples are given to illustrate the methods."
"In this correspondence the distributed model of an electric transformer is analyzed consisting of a pair of mutually coupled lossless transmission lines terminated by linear resistor networks. The difference equations in the time domain describing the transient response are derived, and the results of the numerical solution are presented. The applications illustrate how the computer program can be used to evaluate the transient response of some transmission-line transformers or pulse crosstalk between coupled lines."
"This correspondence describes the root locus of an active distributed RC circuit that may be used for the synthesis of the magnitude response of a pair of complex conjugate poles. It is shown that the locus of the dominant poles of the system transfer function is a well-defined parabola. Such characteristics may be used for the realization of the magnitude response of a class of parabolic filters with identical distributed networks. A design table based on the dominant poles of this system transfer function is derived, and a technique for estimating the excess phase due to the presence of the nondominant poles is presented. Q sensitivity to variations in gain as well as the circuit step response is included."

"This correspondence presents a method for the realization of a maximum gain RC ladder with prescribedz_{11}andz_{12}parameters. The quantitiesR_{max}/R_{min}andC_{max}/C_{min}, which give the permissible spread on the element values, are also investigated as design parameters."
"A unity-gain amplifier together with passive RC elements is shown to realize driving-point admittance functions having a numerator degree equal to, or one greater than, the denominator degree; poles on the negative real axis, excluding the origin; and zeros anywhere in the s plane excepting the positive real axis. Synthesis procedure is discussed and illustrated with two examples of current interest concerning realization of a solid-state inductance and one example of synthesis of a nonpositive real function."
"New methods of synthesizing symmetrical lattice networks using resistors and capacitors, or resistors and inductors, are presented in the paper. The methods permit the synthesis of any transfer function that is a ratio of output voltage or current, to input voltage or current, as long as the transfer function satisfies the conditions of physical realizability of transfer functions with RC or RL networks. The load impedance can also be specified as long as it is realizable with an RC or RL network. A transfer function is synthesized by synthesizing an equivalent open-circuit voltage transfer function that is derived from the desired transfer function and load impedance. The resulting network is then modified, and the desired transfer function with the given load is obtained. Two root-loci plots are used in the synthesis procedures, as well as in a proof that any open-circuit voltage transfer function satisfying the conditions of physical realizability of RC transfer functions can be synthesized using the prescribed method. The network, resulting from the synthesis of an open-circuit voltage transfer function, has maximum gain and a minimum number of elements, if desired."
"A general synthesis procedure capable of realizing any stable transfer function is described; generalized-immittance converters are used in which the input immittance is proportional tos^{2} \\timesload immittance. The resulting realizations are shown to have low sensitivity to element variations. The sensitivity in realizations of second-order transfer functions is independent of the selectivity and it is shown to be much lower than the sensitivity in realizations using positive-gain amplifiers or negative-immittance converters. A unique feature is that in some cases the same circuit can be used as a low-pass as well as a high-pass filter. The synthesis procedure is illustrated by examples and experimental results."
"When two twin T's are connected in cascade in the feedback path of an amplifier, the response is different from the usual expectation. There are, of course, two selective peaks, but the frequencies of the two peaks are considerably different from the null frequencies of the twin T's. Universal charts have been given for the computation of these peak frequencies knowing the loop gain and the null frequencies, and vice versa."
"Several new results on the generation of realizable RC driving-point functions from given RC impedance function(s) are described. Applications of some of these results have led to new necessary relations on the coefficients of the numerator and denominator polynomials of RC and RLC driving-point impedance functions."
"The method of small-signal analysis of nonlinear time-invariant networks about a fixed operating point is well known. When the bias is time-varying the method remains essentially unchanged. This method has been extensively used in perturbational analysis in optimum control theory. Desoer and Wong have given estimates of the difference between the exact response and that of the linearized network, and have shown that, under certain conditions, the relative difference goes to zero as the small signal goes to zero [1]. In the present work, we show how calculations can be greatly simplified when the bias is slowly varying. Making use of recent results of stability theory, we show that small-signal analysis about the frozen operating point is correct within higherorder terms in the small signal, provided a correction term is inserted in the equation. An important feature of the theory is that its assumptions can often be checked by inspection because it involves only the properties of the frozen network. Section I gives a formal description of the method. In Section II, the method is rigorously analyzed and the results are stated in the form of two assertions."
"In this correspondence, a chain-matrix factorization technique has been proposed for the ladder realization of transformerless two-element-kind two-ports. The chain matrix may be either completely or partially specified. Realizability conditions are discussed and the reduction technique required to effect a synthesis is developed. In addition, a technique to maximize the gain constant of the transfer function of an RC two-port network is also developed."
 "This correspondence presents a method of realizing a set of open-circuit RC impedance functionsz_{11}, z_{12}, ,, , z_{22},z_{23}, ,, ,z_{rr},,. A simple and systematic technique of determining the parameter matrices is developed by using linear transformations. A pertinent network is obtained through the realization of the conductance parameter matrix by a single-element-type network for the tree configuration, and the capacitance matrix is obtained by connecting unit capacitors to the appropriate nodes."
"Graph theoretic techniques provide a convenient tool for the investigation of the vulnerability of a communication network to either natural or enemy-induced damage. In this paper, the communication network is represented by a nonoriented linear graph, and the problem of synthesizing networks to provide optimal. protection against damage is investigated. Damage is associated with the removal of a set of nodes that disconnects the graph or by the removal of a set of edges that disconnects the graph. It is assumed that fixed cost for edges may be envisioned as prescribing the total number of edges allowed to connect a given number of nodes. A class of graphs that provides optimum damage protection for a fixed cost is then derived. Bipartite graphs are investigated in detail. It is shown that the complete bipartite graph is also an optimal damage-resistant net and that it can be decomposed into Hamiltonian cycles to yield optimal graphs of lower order. Another possible criterion of optimality is introduced and studied. This new measure is the minimum number of edges that must be deleted in order to isolate a given number of nodes. It is then shown that the complete bipartite graph is also optimal with respect to this alternative measure of vulnerability. This paper also contains proofs of several new and interesting graph theoretic results."
"The problem of constructing networks that are \"survivable\" with respect to branch damage is considered. A square redundancy matrixR = [r_{i,j}]is specified. Algorithms are given to construct a graph with minimum number of branches so that for alli, jthere are 1) at leastr_{i,j}undirected branch disjoint paths between the ith and thejth vertices, or 2) there are exactlyr_{i,j}undirected branch disjoint paths between the ith and the jth vertices. These algorithms are closely related to the optimal realization of terminal capacity matrices. Two of the algorithms are extended to the optimal realization of terminal capacity matrices for symmetric or pseudosymmetric graphs."

   "This paper considers the design of linear time-varying networks and of nonlinear time-invariant networks, the latter being operated in the small-signal mode. In the first part, the design example considered is a network whose time delay is a prescribed function of time. A quadratic performance criterion 'is formulated and the design is obtained iteratively by steepest descent. The second part of the paper considers the design of a nonlinear timeinvariant network with variable bias sources whose small-signal equivalent network is identical with a given linear time-varying network. Explicit conditions are given under which this can be done."

"A method is described for simplifying the optimum design of active networks that use operational amplifiers. The optimum design is based on minimization of the sensitivity of the steady-state frequency response to changes in amplifier gain."
"An active-feedback distributedRCnetwork capable of matching the magnitude response of a pair of complex-conjugate poles and simultaneously giving linear phase is described. The linearity of the phase response is further improved when exponentially tapered\\overline{RC}networks are utilized. It is shown that such characteristics can be used for simultaneous realizations of flat magnitude response and linear phase. Butterworth magnitude responses having phase linearity associated with those of transitional Butterworth-Thomson filters and Thomson magnitude responses having better phase linearity than those achievable by active lumped RC networks can be realized by cascading these circuits. In addition, it has been found that exponential tapering substantially reduces the required gain and theQsensitivity to changes in gain for a given pole position. Reduction in gain with improvement inQsensitivity to changes in gain makes these circuits attractive for high-frequency applications."
"A circuit is presented by means of which a bandelimination filter can be realized using a finite-gain voltage amplifier. A reduction of the number of passive elements allows the realization of low-, high-, and band-pass filters."
 "Multiterminal common-ground networks of resistors, capacitors, and grounded finite-gain phase-inverting voltage amplifiers are considered in this paper. Following a review of methods for the analysis and synthesis of active RC networks, some problems in the application of Sandberg's synthesis method when phase-inverting voltage amplifiers serve as active elements are pointed out. It is proved that, in general, 2n phase-inverting voltage amplifiers are required for the synthesis of a generaln \\times nrational admittance matrix. A new structure is suggested and later simplified for special but important cases. Considerable saving in the amount of computations involved and in the number of passive components used are achieved. Examples are given."
"This paper is concerned with the following problem. Given two terminating resistances R, and R0, design a low-pass ladder RC network of n sections such that the magnitude of the transfer-voltage ratio|V_{1}/V_{2} (j\\omega_{o})|is minimized at a given phaseshift\\angle V_{1}/V_{2}(j\\omega_{0})) = \\phi_{0}and at a given frequency\\omega. This problem is solved explicitly. It was found that the optimumRCphase-shift network is a geometrical progression network properly terminated at both ends. In the distributed case (napproaches infinity), the optimum\\overline{RC}network is an exponentially tapered line, terminated by four lumped impedances."
"For a carrier-type amplifier (e.g., a chopper amplifier), it is well known that the low-frequency response may extend to dc. The position regarding the high-frequency response is not as clear, and statements in the literature give various fractions of the fundamental carrier frequency as an upper limit to the input-signal bandwidth that can be recovered from the modulated carrier. It is argued here that there is no simple well-defined theoretical upper limit, and that in practical circuits the fundamental carrier frequency may or may not be one of several factors determining the useful bandwidth. The circuit of a novel wide-band dc amplifier, consisting of two synchronized chopper amplifiers operating in parallel, is described. The frequency response of this amplifier is independent of the chopping rate, and its method of operation may help clarify bandwidth limitations."
"A phase-locked loop incorporating a sawtooth phase comparator and anRCor phase-lag filter is considered in a noisefree environment. The pull-in time problem during initial synchronization or abrupt change of the input frequency is studied in detail and equivalently the out-of-lock time, when the loop is \"knocked out of lock and then brought back to its normal operation.\" An exact and convenient graphical method is presented for the evaluation of the number of \"skipped\" cycles and the pull-in time (or out-of-lock time) for any input mistuning within the pull-in range and any initial state (i.e., any initial phase and frequency offset) of the system. For large initial mistuning, a simple approximation that avoids the graphical procedure is given. These graphical methods provide qualitative insight and quantitative information as to the pull-in performance and beat mode of operation."
 "In practice one is not only interested in the qualitative type of information obtainable from the stability (in the Lyapunov sense) of a dynamic system, but also in quantitative data, such as specific trajectory bounds and specific transient behavior. A system could, for example, be stable and still be completely useless because it may exhibit undesirable transient characteristics (e.g., it may exceed certain limits imposed on the trajectory bounds). In order to develop a meaningful quantitative theory for the analysis of dynamic systems, stability is defined here in terms of subsets of the state space that are prespecified in a given problem and, in general, may be time varying. The properties of these subsets yield not only information about the stability of a system, but they also yield estimates of trajectory bounds and of trajectory behavior. The theory developed here is general enough to include autonomous and nonautonomous systems, linear and nonlinear systems, simple systems and interconnected systems. The composite, or interconnected systems considered are analyzed and treated in terms of their subsystems. After stating various definitions of stability and instability, theorems that yield sufficient conditions for stability and instability are stated and proved. These theorems involve the existence of Lyapunov-like functions which in general do not possess the usual definiteness requirements on V and V. In order to demonstrate the developed theory, several examples are considered."
"In this paper, we show that the Laplace transform of the expansionh(t) = \\sigma_{n = 0}^{\\infty} c_{n} g_{n} (t)for some important setsg_{n} (t)is equivalent to a power-series expansion. Techniques based on this result are presented for obtaining the coefficients c. as those of a power series; also, methods are presented for obtaining the functional series inverse. The set of Laguerre functions is discussed in detail and, using the power-series equivalence, the truncation error is obtained. The application of the power-series equivalence to the summing of series is shown and illustrated with the Neumann series. Finally, the extension of the power-series equivalence to the expansion of functions of several variables is given. The areas for which the techniques developed are relevant include the analysis and design of signals and the identification and synthesis of processes and systems."
"Combinatorial algorithms for generating subscripts applicable to formulas forABCDparameters of cascaded loadedline sections are presented. The subscript generation process is a generalization and extension of a somewhat similar process developed some time ago in the study of ladder-network subscript structure."
"A procedure based on the \"branch-and-bound\" method and the \"bottleneck\" problem is presented to factor a transfer function of anRCactive two-port such that the sensitivity with respect to the active parameters is minimized."
"The average energy stored by the elements of a linear passive time-invariant one-port is examined. Except in special cases, the energy storage is not determined by the impedance functionZo(p)alone. However, it is shown that for a givenZo(p)there is a minimum energy storage for sinusoidal excitation. Further, this minimum energy can be achieved at all frequencies as a minimum energy synthesis."
   "A new set of conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the periodic solution of the equation\\ddot{x} + f(x)\\dot{x} + g(x) = 0(superscript dot =d/dt) is given. Lyapunov-like functions are used in the derivation of the results. This permits the formulation of the existence and uniqueness conditions in a simple yet general way. The present conditions include those of Libnard and Levinson and Smith when particularized to the above equation. They also permit the inclusion of most of the cases of two-stroke oscillators covered by the author's previous theorems for equations of the above type. Periodicity results for the forced equation\\ddot{x} + f(x)x + g(\\dot{x}) = e(t)withe(t)periodic and bounded are also given."
"A new method for realizing a rational transfer-function matrix, in the factored form, into an irreducible Jordan canonical form state equation is presented. The method consists of two steps. First, the irreducible Jordan form structure of the internal dynamics of the system is determined simply from the ranks of an augmented coefficient matrix and its submatrices, without actually having to construct a realization. Second, the augmented coefficient matrix is decomposed in a simple manner to obtain the final realization. The construction procedure is straightforward and allows one to choose explicitly the element values with a high degree of freedom. As a natural consequence of the irreducible realization, the rank of the augmented coefficient matrix associated with a pole is defined as the degree of the pole in question. This new definition is equivalent to the McMillan/Duffin-Hazony/Kalman degree. Using this definition, many well-known properties of the degree of a rational matrix are readily established."
"Necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained that a set of admittance functions having a single finite pole be realizable as an RC three-terminal network. The necessary conditions are more restrictive than the familiar residue and coefficient conditions."
   "Users of nonlinear transient network-analysis programs, which use explicit integration procedures, have reported that excessive computer time is required to compute the transient response of networks containing widely separated time constants. Several recent papers have shown that for these problems significant computation-time reductions can be obtained by using implicit integration formulas. This paper is concerned with the selection and implementation of an implicit integration formula used in the CIRPAC nonlinear transient network-analysis program. Time-comparison data presented here indicate that the integration system that is described in this paper is significantly faster than the integration system of a network-analysis program that uses an explicit integration algorithm."
"The port impedance and admittance matrices of threelayer structures of linear, passive, isotropic materials are defined and their properties briefly investigated. Discrete equivalent circuit representations are given, together with two examples."
"The closed-form solution is presented for microwave bandpass nonminimum phase transfer functions that exhibit an optimum passband maximally flat amplitude characteristic while maintaining a maximally flat group-delay response about band center. There are two basic transfer functions obtained depending upon whether the degree of the resulting network is even or odd. The transfer characteristics are shown to be capable of being realized by resistively terminated symmetrical generalized interdigital networks. Synthesis procedures are presented for the case of n odd corresponding to the input and output ports being situated at the same physical end of the generalized interdigital line and for the case n even where the ports are at opposite ends. These procedures are based upon the one-port synthesis of the even- and odd-mode forms. Finally, the synthesis procedure is illustrated for the case ofn = 6, and typical transfer characteristics are shown for this example."
 "A passive transfer-function synthesis based upon statespace techniques is presented. The method rests upon the formation of a coupling admittance that, when synthesized by resistors and gyrators, is to be loaded by capacitors whose voltages form the state. By the use of a Lyapunov transformation, the coupling admittance is made positive real, while further transformations allow internal dissipation to be moved to the source or the load. A general class of configurations applicable to integrated circuits and using only grounded gyrators, resistors, and a minimal number of capacitors is obtained. The minimum number of resistors for the structure is also obtained. The technique illustrates how state-variable theory can be used to obtain results not yet available through other methods."
"The magnetoelectric effect element has been treated as one of the electric-circuit elements and the equivalent circuit calculated by introducing four-terminal constants. The circuit is shown to contain the gyrator, and it is concluded that its capacitance operates as the inductance. The results have theoretically been applied to the low-frequency isolator, and the transmission characteristics of the ladder-type circuit are discussed by shifting a connection. At the same time, the result obtained is extended to the distributed constant line, and its transmission characteristics have proved to be unusual."
"A complete topological characterization is given forRCnetworks that realize anRCdriving-point impedance with minimum total capacitance or resistance. In particular, it is shown that for a constant input voltage, maximizing the steady-state capacitor voltages minimizes the total capacitance, and for a constant input current, maximizing the steady-state resistor currents minimizes the total resistance. It then follows that one of the Foster canonical forms is a minimum total capacitance structure and the other is a minimum total resistance structure. Explicit formulas for the minimum total capacitance and resistance are given."
"This correspondence presents a theorem that relates the tree matrix of a graph to the existence of a dual graph (planarity). Using this theorem, a purely algebraic procedure is formulated for finding a dual graph of a given graph, and a test for the planarity of a graph can also be developed. The planarity test is of theoretical interest but appears to be more complicated than known methods."
  "This paper concerns digital single-sideband modulators with analog inputs and outputs. A group of 12 modulators is treated as a single system, with analog-to-digital converters at 12 input ports and a digital-to-analog converter at a single output port. Tradeoffs are obtained between computational parameters. Substitution of digital counterparts for the phase shifters and product modulators in 12 analog Hartley modulators gives a simple program. However, operation in real time requires quite a large number of multiplications per second. A similar digitalization of 12 Weaver modulators requires even more multiplications. However, the 12 Weaver modulators can be transformed as a system, to reduce the multiplication rate for the Hartley system by a factor4. The cost is an increase in scratch pad storage and a more complex program."
"A method to increase the versatility of digital filters is described and analyzed. It is shown how the time between consecutive samples can be advantageously used to process further the stored information. This is achieved without the incorporation of any additional memory capacity, by recirculating the stored signals in the internal paths of the digital filters. During this process, the filter multiplication constants may take up new values in the various shift sequences. This processing leads to multiple output signals with different effective transfer functions. The form of the transfer functions makes them particularly suitable for the realization of variable filters, as desired variations of the filter characteristics can often be achieved by the variation of a single parameter. The method can also be used to reduce the requirement of coefficient accuracy in filters of second and higher degree."
"Among the theorems of circuit theory, Tellegen's theorem is unusual in that it depends solely upon Kirchhoff's laws and the topology of the network. The theorem therefore applies to all electrical networks that obey Kirchhoff's laws, whether they be linear or nonlinear, time-invariant or time-variant, reciprocal or nonreciprocal, hysteretic or nonhysteretic; the excitation is arbitrary, and the initial conditions are also immaterial. When specific assumptions are made concerning the network elements, the excitation, and the initial conditions, Tellegen's theorem reduces to many useful network theorems. In this paper a generalized form of Tellegen's theorem that allows the efficient derivation of new results is presented. A special formthe \"difference form\"-of this theorem is shown to be of particular value, and also capable of simple expression in terms of wave variables. The application of the generalized form of Tellegen's theorem is illustrated by an example."
"A new circuit realizing high stableQ's is presented. The frequency dependence of the operational amplifiers, which has been the principal limiting factor for highQat higher frequencies for networks presented in the literature, has been taken into account. The performance of the new network is shown to be superior to the realizations thus far presented in the literature for the following reasons. TheQrealized by the new circuit is independent of the operational-amplifier bandwidth, which results in a stable response. The realization is also insensitive to manufacturing tolerances and, therefore, it can be readily tuned for the desiredQand center frequency without encountering any stability problems."
 "Lin, Tokad, and Szentirmai have discussed in this TRANSACTIONS an algorithm proposed by the author for the synthesis of ladders. In this correspondence, details are given on the relations of this algorithm with rational interpolation, on the pass band case, and on the remarkable case of Zolotarëv (elliptic) filters."
 "A general result on the relationship of noise margin and gain-bandwidth limitation of a singly terminated lossless equalizer is presented. This general result is applied to obtain the noise margin of the Legendre filters in a simple and straightforward manner."
 "The paper gives explicit formulas for the component values in a general low-pass ladder filter in terms of the coefficients of the polynomials of the open- or short-circuit input impedance and of the frequencies of infinite loss. The formulas are a direct generalization of the results given by Bader in: 1940 for the special case where all the loss poles are at infinite frequency and use determinants that are natural extensions of those due to Hurwitz. An alternative representation of these determinants has been found in the form of a double bialternant that provides a link with some recent work by Navot. One motivation for presenting these various formulas is the hope that they will help in discovering the explicit formulas for the elliptic-function filter."
"The editorial staff, with the approval of the Administrative Committee, decided to put increasing emphasis on solid-state, integrated and other active circuits, digital circuits, nonlinear and/or time-variable networks, distributed circuits, and computer-aided circuit design will be, if possible, even more eagerly received than contributions on more conventional topics. Also, special issues will be forthcoming with increasing frequency on these subjects. The first two of these, one on computer-aided circuit desiga and the other on active and digital circuits, will be published in 1971. In addition, in order to remain competitive with other journals in its field, this TRANSACTIONS is taking steps to speed up publication time. While there is a five-month period required for the editorial processing and printing of manuscripts, we shall make a determined effort to cut down on the review period and on the waiting necessitated by limitations on the number of pages that we have budgeted for. As a first step, starting with the 1971 issues, CIRCUIT THEORY will become a bimonthly publication, published in January, March, May, July, September, and November. Also, the number of pa.ges published every year has been increased. The combined effect of these changes, we hope, should result in a mean publication time of no more than eight months."
   "This paper analyzes the intermodulation distortion of a solid-state feedback amplifier. Each transistor of the amplifier has been represented by a frequency-dependent model incorporating four nonlinearities. The Volterra series is used as the analysis tool. The primary motivation for this study is that intermodulation distortion is a critical problem in high-frequency long-haul solidstate systems. A computer program that calculates the amplifier intermodulation distortion has been developed. This program can be used to select the optimum bias point of each stage, optimum interstage and feedback networks, and optimum load and source impedances. Good correlation between calculated and measured results was obtained. The closed-form expressions derived show that the feedback is fully effective in reducing the open-loop second-order distortion and that the feedback may not significantly reduce the open-loop third-order distortion, if the \"second-order interaction\" phenomenon is dominant. The second-order interaction is explained in detail in this paper."
"The selection of pole-zero pairs for the second-order realization of prescribednth-order networks with minimum sensitivity is discussed. It is shown that a class of second-order networks exists for which the transmission sensitivity is independent of the zero locations. The transmission sensitivity of all other networks can be minimized in a number of ways. One way is to select the polezero pairs as far apart from one another as possible. Other methods depend on the network realization or on the polynomial decomposition used."
"Using a two-port activeRCnetwork containing one ideal differential input and output operational amplifier, realization procedures are developed for simultaneous realization of any pair of the four short-circuit admittance parameters. The only stipulation on the parameters is that they must be real rational functions in the complex frequency variable. Experimental verification of one of the procedures is presented. The procedures are generalized to theN-port case in order to show that one amplifier and anRCnetwork are sufficient for the simultaneous realization of any N admittance parameters provided one parameter is prescribed from each column (row) of the admittance matrix of the activeN-port network, but proof appears in (10)."
"Positive-impedance converting networks may be used to realize driving-point inductance and frequency-dependent negative resistance. TheQfactors of these immittances are evaluated over a wide frequency range in terms of the relevant parameters. Three distinct types ofQ-factor behavior are derived and it is shown that extended wide-band operation may be achieved such thatQfactor is virtually independent of amplifier phase shift. The use of design-value asymptotes is explained as a means of determining the behavior of practical circuits."
"This correspondence presents a simple explanation on the operation and equation of phase motion of an injectionsynchronized oscillator in the presence of incoming noise in a simple way with particular reference to the effect of partly instantaneous limiting, due to the self-bias circuit of the oscillator. A simple relation between the mean-square frequency error and the time constant of the self-bias circuit has also been found by the application of the Fokker-Planck technique."
"A method of realizing transfer functions having poles on the negative real axis and zeros anywhere in the s plane is presented. The circuit uses an inverting amplifier of maximum gain unity and a minimum phase RC network in a dual-input unbalanced configuration. The theory is illustrated by two examples of biquadratic nonminimum phase RC transfer functions, of which one is an all-pass type. The sensitivity of the realizations to active and passive element variations is also discussed."
"Some equivalent networks are presented for positive immittance inverters and converters. The simplest configurations are described with two and three nullors that correspond to sixty-two different inverter circuits and sixty-six different converter circuits. The theorem of \"twin\" transformation of networks with nullors, which was used in the development of some equivalent networks, is outlined."
"This correspondence describes a practical active lowpass network consisting of a cascade of a uniform and an exponential line, and a single voltage-controlled voltage source of finite-source resistance. The network is simulated on a digital computer and optimized with respect to pertinent network parameters. The sensitivity of the optimized network is studied with respect to the gain of the controlled source. It is shown that this sensitivity may be reduced by increasing the taper factor of the exponential line, and that the band-elimination action of the finite-source resistance may be overcome by the uniform line."
"A study of the reduction process used to obtain the state equations for a network containing capacitors, resistors, inductors, and controlled and incontrolled sources of all types, gives the necessary and sufficient conditions for such a network to possess a solution. These conditions involve both the topology of the network and its element values. The formation of the state equations also depends both on the network's topology and its element values. It is shown that the state variables can be chosen from the variables associated with the controlled sources, and any set of state variables chosen for the passive network, formed by removing all the sources. A topological restriction on the active network, which ensures that the maximum order of complexity of the active network is the same as that of this passive network, is given."
"The class of nonenergetic n ports, i.e., those n ports that have at most finite energy gain, are studied in a scattering theoretic context. The properties of suchnports are shown to extend naturally those of passive n ports, and a number results on passive n ports, including the theorem of Youla, Castriota, and Carlin concerning the relationship between passivity and causality, are extended to the nonenergetic case."
"The relationship between the equivalent network theories of Howitt and Schoeffler is discussed. It is shown that under special conditions both methods generate the same equivalent networks."
 "When one tries to write state equations, in normal form, for an RLC network with excess elements employing principle of superposition, one encounters several difficulties. The method proposed in this correspondence avoids such difficulties and broadens the class of networks that could be formulated in normal form using the principle of superposition."
 "This correspondence deals with the elimination of zero eigenvalues of the A matrix for linear time-invariant RLC networks and the consequent reduction of order of the state equations. The state variables used are a subset of the capacitor voltages and inductor currents, chosen such that the order of the state equation is equal to the number of finite nonzero eigenvalues or natural frequencies of the network. Two methods are given for the reduction to minimum order of the commonly used linear state equation."
"This paper suggests a new presentation for the transmission-line networks. In the same way as Richards' presentation, in which the frequency transformation t = tanh sT was used to convert a class of transmission-line networks into lumped networks consisting of L, C, and unit elements, the frequency transformation q = sinh' sT is now used for converting the cascade transmissionline networks into a lumped ladder network consisting of R, C, and possibly an ideal transformer at one end. The new equivalent network maintains a one-to-one relationship with the components of the transmission-line network without doubling the number of components. It has the advantage that the final network presentation is a lumped two-element-kind network. Classical network theories can therefore be applied directly. For purpose of illustration, the cascade unit-element network and cascade unit-loop network are considered in detail. It is shown that the cascade unit-element network can be presented by a ladder RC network, and the cascade unit-loop network by a mid-series low-pass RC network. The continued-fraction expansion technique and the zero-shifting technique can therefore be used, respectively, for the synthesis of the two networks."
"Transient synthesis using multilayer RC distributed networks is presented in this paper. It is shown that any transient response belonging to the LI (0, c) class may be approximated in the sense of least mean-square error, by the voltage impulse response of a multilayer RC distributed network. The mean-square deviation of such an approximation can be made as small as desired by increasing the number of dielectric and resistive layers of the network. Experimental results are given."
"The exponential representation of the general solution of the telegraphists' equation is studied through product decomposition of the fundamental solution matrix. Motivation is provided by the isolation of the uniform-like portion of the general solution, while solvability is reduced to that of a Riccati differential equation."
   "The networks composed of cascaded unit elements having the same length and the same number of wires are studied with reference to the relations between input, output, and transfer admittances. A set of conditions is given that allows the calculation of the output and transfer admittances from the input one and assures the realizability of the said networks."
 "This paper considers the problem of multiport passive network synthesis for a rational bounded real scattering matrixS(p)using state-space ideas. The technique is to extract reactances from a network synthesizing the prescribedS(p)to yield a resistive coupling network that may contain transformers, resistors, and if there is no reciprocity constraint, gyrators. Here a minimum number of reactive elements are always sufficient to give a synthesis, reciprocal and nonreciprocal. The synthesis method relies on an algebraic criterion for a class of rational matrices termed \"discrete bounded real\" that solves the passive synthesis problem. Starting with an arbitrary coordinate basis, a state-space description is found for a discrete bounded real matrix derived from the given bounded realS(p). A coordinate transformation of the state-space is found from the solution of an algebraic equation, which yields almost immediately a passive synthesis forS(p). When a synthesis for a symmetric bounded realS(p)is required to use no gyrators, a further state-space, basis transformation is found that preserves passivity and simultaneously inserts reciprocity. The contributions of this paper, to scattering matrix synthesis, are twofold: first, to solve the nonreciprocal synthesis problem including the mimimal reactive element equivalence problem via calculations that need not rely on application of any classical ideas, and second, to present for the first time a reciprocal synthesis of a passive symmetric scattering matrix with a minimum number of reactances using state-space ideas."
 "A theorem is obtained that shows the sensitivity of a natural frequency of an LCR network with respect to an element is proportional to the voltage-current product of the natural oscillation at the element. The worst case sensitivities for the natural frequencies are also given."
"The effect of the standard low-pass to bandpass frequency transformation on the group-delay characteristics is reviewed and a new easily computed formula for the derivative of the group delay at band center is derived. It is further shown that at frequencies where the definition of group delay has physical interpretation, this derivative is never positive. Also presented is a new identity relating the poles of an all-pole transfer function and the element values of the synthesized network."
"The concepts of network of departure and padding n-port network are defined and certain important properties of these networks are stated. A necessary and sufficient criterion for the realization of the modified cut-set matrix of a resistive n-port network having a prescribed configuration is given. A new approach to the synthesis of short-circuit conductance matrix of a resistive n-port network with more than (n + 1) nodes is outlined. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the realization of the potential factor matrix of an (n + 2) node resistive n-port network are also obtained. These conditions lead to a simple t&t for the realizability of the modified cut-set matrix of an (n + 2) node n-port network. Examples are worked out to illustrate the application of these results."
"The problem of constructing networks that are \"survivable\" with respect to branch damage is considered. The networks are modeled by linear graphs and a square symmetric \"redundancy\" matrixR'=[r'_ij]is specified. Algorithms are given to construct an undirected graphGwith a minimum number of branches such that 1)Gcontains no parallel branches, and 2) for alli, jthere are at leastr'_ijbranch disjoint paths between the ith and jth vertices. These algorithms are complicated but may easily be applied to construct graphs with several hundred vertices."
"A new concept of topological degrees of freedom is introduced as a generalization of the concepts of rank and nullity. This number.corresponds to the minimum number of independent variables taken in mixed analysis of electrical networks, which is a generalization of well-known node-pair and loop analysis. An explicit formula giving topological degrees of freedom and a graph-theoretical algorithm for finding all the minimum sets of independent variables are presented. Another new concept of extremal tree is introduced and shown to play a central role in obtaining the results."
"In this paper we present several sufficient conditions for realizability of terminal capacity matrices of vertex-weighted directed graphs. First necessary and sufficient conditions for a matrix to be realizable by a vertex-weighted directed tree are derived and an algorithm for synthesis is given. Next, as an intermediate step, necessary and sufficient conditions for realizability by a vertex-weighted undirected tree are obtained. These results are then combined to give necessary and sufficient conditions for realizability as a vertex-weighted tree containing both directed and undirected branches. As a corollary, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for realizability as a vertex-weighted tree that is a directed path. A simple extension of this result gives realizability conditions for a vertex-weighted directed circuit. Finally we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for realizability as a vertex-weighted graph containing no directed circuits."
"This paper gives a simple proof of Tutte's realizability condition for a cutset (circuit) matrix of a nonoriented graph [1],[2]. First, a minimum nonrealizable matrix is defined as~a matrix[ N U]that satisfies 1)[N U]is not a cutset (circuit) matrix, 2)[ N U]does not satisfy the conditions in Tutte's theorem, and 3) deleting any column ofN1or any row of any normal form[N1 U]of[N U], the resultant matrix is realizable as a cutset (circuit) matrix. A proof of Tutte's theorem in this paper is accomplished by showing that minimum nonrealizable matrices do not exist."
"This paper considers the problem of global asymptotic stability of a system S of nonlinear networks I (i), j = 1, - ,n, interconnected by lossless transmission lines. Each 0(i) consists of a linear time-invariant lumped-parameter multiport network with a nonlinear element (resistor or capacitor) in parallel or (resistor or inductor) in series with each of its output ports. The voltage-current, voltage-charge, and current-flux linkage relationships for the nonlinear elements are assumed to lie in a sector. The transmission lines introduce time delays in the overall system as well as loading effects at the terminals of the networks. On the assumption that the linear system obtained by deleting (appropriately shorting or opening) the nonlinear elements is asymptotically stable by satisfying, for example, Brayton's conditions, this paper develops a frequency-domain condition that guarantees global asymptotic stability of the system S. This result is achieved by suitably modifying and extending the result of Popov and Halanay."
"A generalized approach for synthesizing a prescribed resistive nonlinear n-port is presented with the help of a linear 2nport called the linear transformation converter (LTC). It is proved that a large class of voltage-controlled (current-controlled) resistive nports can be realized by using only one LTC and an appropriate homeomorphic nonlinear n-port. The LTC is shown to be decomposable into the cascade connection of a\"rotator,\" \"reflector,\" and \"scalor.\" This factorization provides not only a general realization technique, but also a geometrical interpretation of the capabilities of the 2-port LTC to transform a monotonic characteristic curve into a prescribed multivalued curve. In particular, necessary and sufficient conditions are given for realizing a multivalued two-terminal resistor by connecting an appropriate monotonic resistor across port 2 of a 2-port LTC."
"This correspondence considers the design of a class of uncoupled nonlinear time-invariant networks operated in the small-signal mode. A necessary and sufficient condition is stated under which, for a given set of \"slowly varying\" bias sources, the characteristics of the nonlinear network can be obtained so that the behavior of the approximate small-signal equaivlent network is identical with the behavior of a prescribed linear time-varying network. A third-order example has been worked out to illustrate the method."
"A new mathematical model of dynamic hysteresis loops is presented. The model is completely specified by two strictly monotonically increasing functions: a restoring function f(.) and a dissipation function g(.). Simple procedures are given for constructing these two functions so that the resulting model will simulate a given hysteresis loop exactly. The model is shown to exhibit many important hysteretic properties commonly observed in practice such as the presence of minor loops and an increase in area of the loop with frequency. In the case of an iron-core inductor, the mathematical model is shown to be equivalent to a lumped-circuit model, consisting of a nonlinear inductor in parallel with a nonlinear resistor. Extensive experimental investigations using different types of cores show remarkable agreement between results predicted by the model with those actually measured. The most serious limitation of this dynamic model is its inability to predict dc behaviors. For the class of switching circuits where dc solutions are important, a special dc lumped-circuit model is also presented."
"The general exact time-varying network functions of N-path filters, called quadrature N-path filters (QNF), are obtained in integral and series forms. It is shown that a subclass of the QNF has characteristics similar to previously treated sampled N-path filters (SNF) and that for a given number of paths N, the allowable input signal frequency bandwidth of the QNF is twice as large as that of the SNF. Thus the mimimum N for the QNF is two instead of the three required for the SNF. It is also shown that the well-known networks used in Weaver's \"third method\" of generating and detecting single-sideband signals correspond to the quadrature two-path filters."
"The use of a time-division multiplexed digital filter as the time-invariant part of anN-path filter is proposed and examined. The use of a digital filter, and the resultant requirements for only one input modulator, alleviates the problem of closely matching the transmission characteristics of the paths. As a consequence of the improving matching, the time-varying modulation products in the output signal should be suppressed 10-15 dB more than in conventional implementations. The center frequency, bandwidth, and passband shape of the filter are all electronically adjustable. It is possible to time division multiplex a processor using serial arithmetic for a bandpass filter with a bandwidth of several kilohertz using high-speed bipolar logic circuits. The speed requirements for the memory are such that MOS circuitry, with its attendant size advantage, is suitable. This approach to realizing an inductorless, electronically adjustable bandpass filter should become economical in the near future because of the decreasing cost and the increasingly complex functions available in both bipolar and MOS circuitry."
"This paper presents an analysis of the transfer function of digital MTI detection filters of the type(1-z^{-1})^{n}followed by a squarer and a detector where the designer has the freedom to vary the interpulse periods. This degree of freedom produces some interesting and useful results, as these simple filters can then be made to exhibit transfer-function characteristics similar to more complex recursive digital filters, yet retaining the finite transient characteristics of the simple nonrecursive filter. Furthermore, there is a great reduction in hardware as the simple filters require no multipliers and fewer storage registers. The key to the analysis and design of such a pulse-staggered filter is the recognition that the magnitude squared transfer function represents a frequency-interference pattern. By properly arranging the interpulse periods the nulls of the interference pattern will coincide with the desired nulls of the required filter-response characteristic. Assuming anN + 1pulse burst (Nodd) to the digital filter, it is shown that the normalized transfer function of the filter1-z^{-1}is|H_{N}(\\omega)|^{2}=1- \\frac{1}{N}\\Sum_{i=1}^N \\cos \\omega T_i.T_{i}is ith interpulse period. If theT_{i}are arranged such that they are uniformly spaced about a mean TA with spacing T, then this transfer function becomes the interference pattern1- \\left[\\frac{\\sin \\frac{N\\omega T}{2}}{\\sin \\frac{\\omega T}{2}}\\right]The value of T is adjusted for the desired true nulls of the frequency characteristic, N is adjusted for the ripple in the passband, and TA is adjusted for mimum number of extrema and cut-off characteristics in the stopband. The transfer characteristic of the digital filter (l-z-')' exhibits two interference patterns, one corresponding to E cos coTe and one corresponding to E cos co(Ti + Ti+,). In this case the order of the Ti is crucial, as large nulls in the passband are to be avoided. Consequently, the Ti are again arranged uniformly spaced about TA with spacing T, but they are rearranged such that the sequence of the sum of two successive interpulse periods have a difference equal to T. When this is accomplished, the main lobes of the modulating envelopes of the interference patterns will coincide only at integer multiples of I/ T, resulting in a passband. Both a mathematical analysis and engineering design rules are presented in this paper."
"Sampled-data filters can exhibit extreme sensitivity to coefficient inaccuracy. This correspondence introduces design techniques that do not restrict the delay interval in the fiter to being equal to the sampling period, thereby providing flexibility in the reduction of sensitivity. An example illustrates the differences between the performance of a filter designed by using these techniques and that of a filter designed by using the well-known method based on the bilinear z transformation."
"The criterion of absolute stability of linear two-ports is well known, and derivations may be found in various monographs on linear active network theory. It generally appears that such derivations are founded on several pages of calculation, admittedly of an elementary kind, but lacking in perspicuity. It is the aim of this correspondence to present a simple and direct derivation of the main part of this criterion, i.e., the part pretaining toj\\omegafrequencies."
"A new and simple method is given for transforming a low-pass filter (LPF) to a high-pass filter (HPF) whose impulse and step-function responses have the same quality (in terms of overshoot, delay, settling time, transition time, etc.) as that of the LPF. The transfer functions, impulse, and step responses of these two filters are related byH_h (s) = 1 - H_l (s), h_h (t) = \\delta(t) - h_l (t), ands_h (A) = 1 - s_l (t), respectively. This immediately enables us to define new classes of low-transient HPFs having little or no overshoot. One new class is obtained by transforming all-pole Bessel filters, but other low-pass families can be transformed to obtain similar results. It is also shown that if the quality of an all-pole LPF transient response is to be retained by the HPF, then the maximum attenuation rate of the HPF magnitude response near\\omega= 0 is 6 dB/octave. These results are additionally beneficial for designing low-transient narrow-band notch filters."

"Idealized antenna patterns to represent pencil-beam antennas are derived from antenna maximum gains and operating wavelengths. The patterns include analytic expressions describing the principal polarization gain functions for the main beam and and first sidelobe. Higher order sidelobes are expressed in terms of smoothed mean power levels of these sidelobes."
"There is increasing interest in multiband antenna installations where the same antenna and feeder are used for radio-relay systems simultaneously operating in the 4-, 6-, and ll-GHz common-carrier bands. At 11 GHz the circular waveguide feeder can support many unwanted modes. Delay distortion is caused in part by higher order mode conversion-reconversion in such an oversized-waveguide feeder. An investigation of the antenna system has revealed that two major sources of delay distortion result at 11 GHz from mode conversion in the system combining networks. This paper discusses the results of this investigation and the steps taken to reduce the mode conversion-reconversion and resulting delay distortion."
"A measuring procedure and circuit are described for power-level determination of odd order \"mixing products\" generated in waveguide components of 6-GHz FM diversity communication systems. Measured results at several carrier frequencies and diversity separations are presented for typical components used (joints, flexible sections, and ferrite components)."
"The use of AGC loops at the input and output of the FM link in an AM-FM telemetry system allows the mean-square transmitter deviation to be maintained near maximum value, even though data may be nonstationary. However, errors result because of the inability of the receiver AGC loop to track perfectly gain variations in the transmitter loop. In this paper the general characteristics of AGC are discussed, and a theoretical analysis is performed to determine the time constant, steady-state error, and tracking error for a first-order loop. Also, tracking error for for first-order and second-order loops is investigated by simulation. Curves are presented to illustrate the principal results."
"A time-domain measuring technique utilizing the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of a received pulse, in conjunction with a few other simple transmission measurements, serves to provide a fast quality check on channels for data communications. Facility makeup of the circuit must be known, since the PAR meter is designed to be especially responsive to envelope delay distortion. This raises potential continuing administrative problems and facility-trunk coordination of changes in makeup caused by high frequency rolls, etc. Troubleshooting via the PAR meter for both switched message network and private line circuits are discussed."
"Data are presented on the surge characteristics of various types and combinations of metals when applied as a shield for buried telephone cables. Surge currents were applied to the shield of 500-foot lengths of cable and the potentials developed between the shield and conductors were measured at selected points along the cable length in order to determine relative susceptibility to lightning influence. The shield metals included copper, aluminum, stainless steel, and low-carbon steel, and combinations of these metals. This program was begun and completed in the calendar year 1968. This program may have a substantial impact in the future designs of cable used in the Rural Electrification Administration systems."
"A modern communications satellite typically amplifies many frequency-modulated radio-frequency carriers in a single common amplifier. The nonlinear phase versus input power behavior of traveling-wave tubes (TWT) and its impact on intermodulation noise and intelligible crosstalk is treated. A theoretical model is presented, which allows calculation of the multicarrier performance of the TWT, and an experimental verification of the model is given."
"This paper describes measurement techniques for rapidly characterizing frequency selective fading channels. The approach used involves estimating each of the parameters describing the transmitted signal and channel disturbances. This includes signal level, noise level, and multipath spread. While specifically applied to FSK modulation and HF channels, the techniques are applicable to other fading media such as troposcatter. The advantages of the proposed techniques are several: the measurement is performed by operating on the transmitted information bits and special test signals or redundancy are not required. Instrumentation is relatively simple and the techniques are applicable to practical communication media. Calculations are provided to determine the measurement time for stated accuracies and confidence levels. Results are obtained for several multipath distributions and as a function of the multipath-to-noise energy ratio."
"A general model for digitally linearizable companding laws for use in digital communication systems is presented. The model is utilized to compare a ternary code presented by Neu and Kündig with a binary code. The primary considerations are ratio of signal to quantization noise, companding improvement, and linearization."
"A communication system with noiseless feedback, noisy forward band-limited channel, and binary source is investigated. Each binary symbol m±is represented by a sequence of signalss\\pm(y_{k})\\varpi(t-k_{\\tau}), the amplitude of which is a function of the a posteriori likelihood ratio Yk. In a sequential receiver a decision is made whenever the likelihood ratio reaches one of two levels Y±; in a nonsequential receiver a decision is assumed after a fixed number of signals is sent. The problem is to design signalss_{\\pm}(Y_{k}), so that given a probability of error and average power the transmission rate is maximized. The problem is solved for both sequential and nonsequential receivers, provided the peak power exceeds some value which is a function of the average power."
"A small and relatively inexpensive automatic equalizer has been developed for use with a vestigial sideband AM data set presently utilized to provide a high-speed Bell System voiceband data service. The equalizer uses a transversal filter structure comprising a tapped analog delay line with a variable-gain circuit associated with each tap. Its operation is adaptive in the sense that the tap-gain-adjustment information is derived from the received data, so that the tap gains are continuously optimized. A number of adaptive tap-gain-adjustment algorithms and transversal filter realizations were considered. The algorithms range in order of implementation complexity from \"zero forcing,\" involving binary correlation, to \"mean square,\" which requires linear correlation. The transversal filter realizations vary from an early scheme, which accomplished the variable-gain function with up-down counters controlling a switchable resistive ladder network, to an all-digital approach, where the analog delay line is replaced by shift registers and the variable-gain function is achieved with binary multipliers. Although the all-digital approach, using the mean-square algorithm and implemented with large-scale integration, will undoubtedly be the best choice in the near future, the equalizer to be described was selected on the basis of its being the cheapest to implement at the present time. The equalizer uses a modified zero-forcing tap-gain-adjustment algorithm, which is no more costly to implement than the zeroforcing algorithm, but which has superior convergence properties in the presence of severe distortion. The variable-gain function is achieved by means of a field-effect transistor (FET) used as a variable resistance. A single operational amplifier is used both to control the resistance of the FET and to provide feedback necessary to insure precise circuit performance without requiring close tolerances on the FET characteristics."
"In digital communications, the theory of optimum data detection requires precise knowledge of the bit transition time at the receiver before bit-by-bit detection can be implemented. This paper presents a method for the optimum design of discrete sequential algorithms for bit synchronization which may readily be implemented with digital hardware or with a digital computer. The method is based on Bayes estimation, opitmization theory for discrete systems, and discrete invariant imbedding. Results of two examples indicate the efficacy of the method."
"A filterless phase-locked loop is considered with an arbitrary periodic phase comparator. The loop has a jittered input and is perturbed by thermal noise. Under such conditions the loop skips cycles from time to time. A study is made of the statistical behavior of the loop and emphasis is placed on the determination of the average time of skipping cycles. This problem is related to the first passage time problem of mathematical statistics and has been studied by a number of authors [1], [2], [3], [15]. The specific interest in the present paper is the study of the effect of timing jitter on the \"spilling\" of stores in a digital transmission system. A comparison of the average frequency of \"spilling' the stores is made for a sawtooth, sinusoidal, and an \"inscribed in\" and \"circumscribed about\" triangular phase comparator. Examples using numbers typical of a digital transmission system show that the average frequency of \"spilling\" the stores in the time division multiplex should be exceedingly small."
"The traffic-carrying capability of three types of common-user mobile radio systems are derived and compared; they are also compared with a private-user system. The systems considered make use of multichannel capability for mobile units or a dispersed array of base stations, or both."
"Problems with delay distortion in a microwave relay system can result from higher order modes propagating in the waveguide feeder. Higher order modes are excited by various means in the antenna aperture. Certain higher order modes must exist in an antenna aperture to satisfy the boundary conditions of the aperture and are therefore excited by plane waves arriving on axis. These modes having on-axis lobes are found by expanding the uniform illumination function of a rectangular and a circular aperture. Higher order mode amplitudes relative to the dominant mode for each aperture shape are tabulated."

"In coded telemetry systems symbol synchronization must be performed at low symbol signal-to-noise ratios (ST/N_{0}) with negligible degradation from the perfect synchronization case. A digital transition tracking synchronizer which operates with less than 0.03-dB degradation atST/N_{0} = -3dB and at rates of 5.6 bit/s to 250 kbit/s is described."
"The C1 EAX is an electronic switching system developed to meet the needs of class-5 central offices of up to 2400 lines and trunks. This system, the special field trial arrangements, and the experiences of the first year of operation are briefly described."
"A previous paper [3] dealt with seven receiver spurious response mechanisms. This paper shows that two of those mechanisms (intermediate-frequency harmonic and mixer p - q) can give responses at identical frequencies. A measurement method is described which allows the predominant mechanism to be identified, and it is shown that either response may predominate in practice."
"A solution of the stationary, mod-2π-reduced phaseerror probability density function for the second-order phase-lock loop is derived, based on a mean square fit to a certain unknown conditional expectation term. The resulting phase variance obtained from this density function yields an error that is negligible for\\sigma_{\\phi}^{2} \\leq 1and an error no greater than 0.06 rad2for signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)≥ 2 dB by comparison with actual measurements, and it appears to be the most accurate to date. The usefulness of the result lies in the fact that an accurate estimate of the phase-error variance for arbitrary parameter values is easily obtained without the use of a computer."
"The efficiency as measured by data rate per unit bandwidth of certain digital modulation systems is compared. The systems considered are frequency modulation (FM), phase modulation (PM), and linear modulation. The achievable bits per cycle in digital PM and amplitude modulation (AM) at a given signal-to-noise ratio and error rate have been known for some time. In digital FM this quantity can be maximized, a fact apparently first realized by J. R. Pierce at Bell Telephone Laboratories. Rigorous optimizations were later carried out by Mazo, Rowe, and the author. In addition to the comparisons made with other systems, additional details related to the optimization problem in frequency-shift keying (FSK) are also furnished. Whereas previous treatments analyzed a frequency discrimination system, this paper treats the optimum detector. The results indicate very minor differences m efficiency attained by the two different models analyzed. Results are exhibited graphically, showing the relationships between the important system parameters."
"Communications system command and control is essential to effective management of a dynamic communications system. An evolutionary concept is described, which has been proven in practice, of a method of controlling a dynamic communications system, of some of the equipments developed for this purpose, and of the major advantages of reporting and displaying system and equipment quality-control information on an automated near-real-time basis."
"Communication links to earth satellites are not usually affected adversely by propagating through the ionosphere. However, the nonlinear variation of the refractive index with frequency causes a dispersion which can result in significant signal distortion under certain circumstances. Such a case occurs, for example, when a wide-band frequency-modulated (FM) signal propagating at the lower carrier frequencies traverses a low-elevation path through a disturbed ionosphere. Expansions are now available for the spectrum of the output phase of an angle-modulated signal which has been passed through a generalized linear filter. The ionosphere is modeled as such a filter in this study and the spectrum of the demodulated signal is determined. From this, formulas are obtained for the output signal-to-distortion and signal-to-crosstalk ratios. The spectral results are presented graphically for FM with a uniform baseband, and two cases of current interest are examined numerically"
"Including a buffer storage into a telemetry data compression system has proven to be both a requirement and a nemesis. Some video compression simulation results which help define buffer requirements for transmitted bit-rate reductions of 2:1 and 3:1 are summarized. The zero-order predictor algorithm with a buffer-controlled variable aperture was found to provide both efficient buffer utilization and acceptable means of controlling buffer \"underflow\" and \"overflow.\" The investigation was limited to worst-case nonstationary video data."
"The peak-to-average ratio (PAR) meter provides a single number measure of the quality of circuits used for transmitting voiceband data signals. A PAR system consists of a generator and a receiver connected to opposite ends of a transmission network to be tested. The generator transmits a precise repetitive pulse through the system, and each pulse is dispersed by the distortions that it encounters. Then, the receiver responds to the pulse envelope peak and to the pulse envelope full-wave average and indicates the ratio on a zero suppressed scale. New equipment to obtain this measure has been designed to avoid ambiguities when used on systems with nonlinear distortion or phase intercept distortion. The PAR concept is reviewed, and the techniques used in this second-generation equipment to overcome these ambiguities and the affects of various distortions on the new meter's response are described. Also, PAR signal spectrum objectives and the measurement sensitivity to circuit parameters are listed."
"Two 15-kHz channels positioned symmetrically in the 60-108-kHz-channel group are used for the transmission of two different programs or one stereophonic program. A new carrierfrequency compandor reduces noise by about 20 dB. The channel group is loaded with a mean power of 500 μW."
"A method is presented for analyzing intermodulation (IM) spectra in limiting amplifiers using a statistical approach. Engineering approximations are derived for the case of a large number of input signals. The accuracy appears to be good down to seven signals. The approach permits analysis of arbitrary locations (in frequency) of the input signals. Possible ways of reducing IM interference in limiting satellite repeaters are discussed. The analysis is generally restricted to the ideal hard-limiting amplifier however, its applicability to other nonlinear characteristics is illustrated. Additional sources of degradation, such as amplitudemodulation-frequency-modulation (AM-FM) conversion and system phase nonlinearity, are not treated."
"Conventional frequency-modulation (FM) detectors show a marked decrease in outputS/Nbelow an inputS/Nof 5 to 10 dB. This threshold effect is caused by \"clicks\" or phase slips of multiples of π. This effect is related to a normalization (clipping) which is very beneficial at highS/N. A detector is described which has no normalization and is superior to the ideal detector below zero to 10 dB inputS/N. The noise at the output of the detector is additive for all inputS/Nratios and in this sense is comparable to synchronous detection of AM. Plots of output noise spectrum and outputS/Nwith and without sine-wave modulation are given. Another detector is also proposed that is asymptotic to the ideal detector at highS/Nand the aforementioned detector at lowS/N. Comparison is made with conventional detectors. The results indicate that this detector may be especially useful in the detection of frequency-shift keying and phase-shift keying in telemetry systems."

"An experimental study of the effects of meteorological conditions and irregular terrain upon the performance of an optimum diversity system showed that: l) the refractive index departed appreciably from a linear profile and was not uniform along the propagation path, and 2) more than two field components were produced by the combination of irregular terrain and the nonlinear refractive index structure. These conditions violate the design assumptions so that the optimum space diversity system failed to provide the theoretical performance. Under such conditions, this same result would be expected for any of the present diversity design procedures."
"Exact error probabilities are given for a binary phase-shift-keyed (PSK) signal which is transmitted over a nondistorting channel, but additively corrupted by Gaussian noise and cochannel interference. Both coherent detection and quasicoherent (noisy reference) detection are considered. The analysis admits a wide class of interferences, but numerical results are limited to interferences modeled by a sum of randomly phased sinusoids. This includes most extraneous analog frequencymodulation (FM), phase-modulation (PM), or digital PSK signals, or combinations of the same which are cochannel with the desired PSK signal."
"CODEST (coding for definition of significant states and transitions) is a system for the transmission of telegraph signals and digital data in coded form. CODEST is a completely \"transparent\" system; i.e., it restitutes the position of significant instants of a modulation whatever the speed and whatever the operating mode, whether synchronous or asynchronous. Furthermore, the telegraph distortion of restituted signals is independent of the transmission channel, and distortion is maintained below a given rate which can be as small as required. The CODEST system is the equivalent for telegraphy of the pulse-code telephone systems (pulse-code modulation) (PCM). The required bandwidth for CODEST may extend, according to the case, from 4 to 10 times the bandwidth required for frequency division transmission, but CODEST is particularly adapted to PCM links. It is well known that PCM systems compensate bandwidth expansion by such great advantages as immunity to noise, simplicity of signal regeneration, and low cost of equipment. Another essential advantage of CODEST is that it replaces data or telegraph signals by a synchronous binary sequence of fixed frequency without any strict relationship to the time base or speed of the original telegraph or data sequences."
"A comparison of the threshold extension capabilities of the phase-lock loop and frequency modulation feedback (FMFB) demodulators is presented. The comparison, instead of being based upon the usual sinusoidal modulating signal type analysis, is based upon analyses which give consideration to the type of modulation that is of most interest to designers of frequency division multiplexfrequency modulation (FDM-FM) systems, i.e., to modulation by a band-limited noise-like signal. The basic operating parameters are defined in terms of rms values. The \"clicks\" analysis of Rice is utilized in the treatment for the two cases of ignoring and including the effects of modulation on the output noise clicks."
"Call routing proceeds, in general, by direct indexing into head-cell referenced tables. A link controller software stage retrieves and stores data pertinent to incoming trunk identification in memory assigned to the sender seized for the call. The decoder channel software stage, separated in time from the link controller stage by electromechanical functions, uses the incoming trunk and sender information to select a routing pattern hierarchy and associated outgoing trunk groups. The routing can be temporarily modified by network control cancellations, skips, and reroutes."
"A family of compatible high-density bipolar codes (CHDB), which allow unrestricted binary signaling on pulse-code modulation (PCM) systems, while limiting the number of consecutive 0's in the coded sequence, are presented. CHDB compares favorably to other transmission plans with the same purpose. Examples of coding, decoding, and error monitoring hardware are given."
"There exists a special kind of loading noise in highly linear push-pull frequency modulators used in radio links. It is caused by the higher order interference products in the mixer of the modulator. This noise can be very annoying and necessitates a careful selection of the oscillator frequencies. The theory leading to optimum frequencies is shown, and equations for the direct calculation of the baseband-interference loading noise are given. Reference is made to experimental results."
"Using the Hilbert transform theory, an expression for the group delay of a minimum-phase bandpass filter is derived. Group delay as a function of amplitude response characteristics (shape factor, bandwidth, and ultimate attenuation) is numerically determined for high-quality filters of the MIL-STD-188C and DCA types. The results are useful in estimating the performance of data transmission systems over unequalized (e.g., voice) links and the difficulty of constructing phase equalizing networks."
"The application of a binary transversal filter as transmitting filter and a digital circuit as modulator makes it possible to construct data transmitters consisting only of transistors and resistors. The modulation distortion, caused by the keying of a low-frequency square-wave carrier, can be compensated by a modification of the transfer function of the transmitting filter, provided the carder frequency is chosen to be a multiple of half the bit rate. This principle makes it possible to realize the whole data transmitter in one single integrated circuit. The binary transversal filter, provided with an analog-to-digital converter, can also be used to construct the data receiver for the greater part with digital circuitry."
"Customer distant dialing without operator intervention is predicated on rapid dependable switching and high-quality transmission with minimum contrast from call to call. It is, therefore, mandatory that each incremental unit in each built-up connection follow the best and latest design practice and be subjected to a rigid preventive maintenance program.

"A set of calculated channel parameters are postulated for a 2800-km HF ionosphericF2-mode propagation path to organize error sequences into stationary samples. Measurements of the single sideband-frequency-shift keying (SSB-FSK) binary error-free run distributions are used with the parameters to obtain stationary Markov chain transition probabilities. A relation between the transition probabilities and the average error probability is verified for the HF channel model. A statistical analysis of error probability and error-free run distribution variation with calculated parameter values suggests that the Markov chain transition probabilities are a function of these parameters."

"A new digital frequency detector for discriminating between the location of a noisy sinusoidal signal in one of two frequency bands is presented. Lower performance bounds of the detector are obtained. It is shown that the detector can discriminate between any two frequencies in a wide frequency band, and that these two frequencies can be arbitrarily close. Furthermore, correct decisions will be made in the presence of interference if maximum displacement of the zero crossings of the received signal due to interference satisfy certain loose bounds. For instance, correct decisions can be made even if there exists a spurious tone interference whose frequency and magnitude are close to those of the information signal. It is also shown that the peak of the impulse noises considered can be close to the peak of the information signal without causing a decision error. The detector can be easily implemented with a small number of standard digital circuits. It operates automatically and nonparametrically without requiring a priori knowledge of the statistics of the signal and interference."
"Phase recovery in vestigial sideband (VSB) data transmission is discussed. Examining a particular aspect of this broad area, attention is focused on the time required to recover carrier phase in order to achieve a satisfactory error rate. We derive the acquisition time for simple models. Our results are exhibited graphically, relating pertinent system parameters. These results indicate that while in double sideband transmission the acquisition time required to achieve a satisfactory error rate is of the order of a few symbol intervals, in VSB transmission this time grows to tens and hundreds of symbol intervals."
"The advent of the laser has generated much interest in its use for communication. Consideration is given in this paper to obtaining a communication channel model of the atmosphere for laser frequencies. For this purpose a fairly exhaustive, tutorial, and partly critical review of a major part of the extensive literature pertaining to theoretical and experimental results on the propagation of laser signals in the atmosphere is given. Some of the basic characteristics of the channel for Which detailed results are given are 1) channel time spread (or, equivalently, channel coherence bandwidth) due to multipathing and dispersion, 2) channel gain, 3) channel doppler spread and coherence time, 4) channel spatial coherence and amplitude covariance functions. Consideration is given to both point receivers and area receivers, heterodyne and direct detection receivers, nonplanar (i.e., spherical and beam) wave propagation, and infinite plane-wave propagation. The results are given for clear weather conditions. Brief attention is given to additive noise. In reviewing the extensive literature dealing with the propagation of optical signals through a turbulent medium, an attempt is made to put this varied, diverse, and in some instances controversial material into proper perspective; to note where theoretical results derived for one set of conditions were applied to experimental results obtained for another set of conditions; to correct some invalid conclusions drawn from some theoretical results as far as signal degradation effects and parameter variations; and to indicate where out-of-date vertical profile models were used with updated models being given, and where possible the new theoretical predictions based on these models provided. The paper should, as a result, be of help to those familiar with the literature as Well as those who are not. For those not acquainted with the literature, in addition to providing a fairly in-depth knowledge of the characteristics of propagation through a turbulent medium and an indication of the status of our understanding of this subject, the paper should provide a stepping stone for obtaining a more thorough understanding of the subject and for doing work in the field."
"The performance impairment resulting from the insertion of a narrow-band rejection filter (notch filter) in a data transmission channel is evaluated. To isolate the effects of notch filtering, it is assumed that, before inserting the notch filter, the data signal is an idealized pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) signal using a pulse shape which produces no intersymbol interference (Nyquist pulse). The intersymbol interference resulting from the notch is examined in terms of 1) its maximum value and 2) its mean-squared value. It is shown that the maximum interference criterion is inappropriate; since it will always exceed the signal pulse amplitude regardless of the shape or rejection bandwidth of the notch filter (a notch always closes the binary eye pattern). The mean-squared interference is easily evaluated in terms of the notch characteristic, and furthermore, this quantity leads to a simple means for predicting the tolerable notch bandwidth for maintaining a specified error performance with additive Gaussian noise. The mean-squared interference for some simple notch filter realizations is presented."
"A double-superheterodyne tracking loop using two frequency converters to provide coherent reference signals for demodulation is analyzed and compared to two other well-known configurations. It is shown that if the loop parameters are defined appropriately, then the dynamic noise performance of the loop is identically equivalent to that of a standard phase-locked loop or a double-superheterodyne tracking loop using a noise-free external reference generator."
"Transient behavior of the first-order phase-locked loop in the presence of noise is investigated. Numerical integration is used to obtain solutions for the Fokker-Planck equation which represents loop dynamics, Results illustrate quantitative behavior of the time-varying probability density function of phase error when the input is a constant frequency sinusoid in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise. Several selected values of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are considered."
"AnMbranch equal-gain predetection space-diversity combiner is analyzed for the case where the signals received from the individual branches of such a combiner are partially correlated. The level crossing rate (LCR) of the combined signal envelope equals the probability density function times a function of the direction of motion. When a linear antenna array is used on a mobile radio receiver, the direction of motion does not affect the shape of the LCR curve of the combined signal but does affect the absolute values, especially when the antenna spacingdis less than 0.5 λ. There is apparently no effect ford > 1 \\lambda"
"This paper deals with the effects of the correlation self-noise on the error voltage of a radio frequency (RF) delaylock discriminator. The error voltage at the output of the envelope correlation network is determined in terms of the spectral components of the maximal-length sequence and the frequency response of the bandpass filters used in the two channels of the correlation network. The slope of the error voltage in the lock-on state, which is readily obtained from the above analysis, is a quantity of particular interest, because the mean-square tracking error is inversely proportional to the square of the slope. The problem of the mismatch in the two channels of the correlation network is also considered."
"A new technique for the transmission of binary data over band-limited channels is described. The signaling method is a generalization of Nyquist's telegraph theory, it allows pulse modulation without intersymbol interference within a frequency spectrum centered at any multiple of one quarter of the signaling rate. The signals are derived from pulse trains generated by a combination of logic circuits and weighting resistors. The number of pulses constituting a signal element varies typically from 5 to 9 in function of the desired total bandwidth. Signaling at 80 percent of the Nyquist rate has been easily achieved with 40-dB out-of-band attenuation. The digital echo modulation eliminates the need for precise analog filters and minimizes the effects of component instability; in addition, it gives a great flexibility to the design, allowing special features such as efficient half-speed operation."
"Results are reported which are of interest in the automatic adaptive equalization of telephone lines or other narrowbandwidth channels where data transmission is limited primarily by intersymbol interference. We describe an algorithm for adjusting the tap gains of a tapped delay line (TDL) equalizer which converges for all channels to the setting, which minimizes the mean-square error (rose) at the filter output due to both noise and intersymbol interference. This algorithm has been implemented using digital microcircuits and metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) shift registers to construct a 63 tap all-digital TDL filter covering 19.7 ms. The modulation system used is vestigal sideband with bandwidth 1.6 kHz. The data rate is 3200 pulses/s, or 9600 bit/s with 8 data levels. A description of the hardware realization and performance data over various telephone lines is given."
"In the pulse-code modulation-time-division-multipleaccess (PCM-TDMA) system for the next global satellite communications, minimization of synchronization bits in each burst is desirable to improve the traffic efficiency. A new phaseshift keyed (PSK) demodulating system with a delay line is proposed to meet the previous requirement, and the design of its scheme and its experimental performance are described. The difference of the error rate performance between theoretical and experimental values was about 0.8 dB, and even in the worst case the error rate of 10-4was assured for an inputE/N_{0}of 10.5 dB."
"An all digital realization of a channel vocoder is described, including both computational algorithms and hardware structures. The machine, constructed almost entirely of digital elements, operates at a 2400 bit/s rate and produces synthetic speech, whose intelligibility and speaker recognition properties are comparable to those of an average telephone line. The extensive use of integrated digital circuitry allows size and cost reductions that are not currently possible in conventional high-quality analog vocoder systems."
"The performance metric (symbol error rate) of the optimum in-the-limit receivers for the detection of a frequency uncertainM-ary frequency shift-keyed (MFSK) transmission in additive Gaussian noise is derived. By in-the-limit, we mean the limiting cases of high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The performance of the two receivers are compared for some special cases. The MFSK wide-band receiving (optimum low SNR receiver for the channel Just described) symbol error rate in a three component-two-path channel is derived when the delay between the direct path and reflected path compared with the data rate is very small."
"A sequential block orthogonal signaling scheme with both an intermittent and a final decision feedback is developed. The reliability function for this communication technique is shown to be bounded below by\\alpha_{max} \\bar{C} - R, for0 \\leq R < \\bar{C}where αmaxis one-half of the ratio of the maximum transmitted signal average power Ppmaxto the expected transmitted signal average power\\bar{P}. The transmitter power advantage of this feedback scheme in a nonasymptotic operational mode is also presented."
"For the purpose of communication system planning, predictions of system performance based upon models of an ideal coherent channel are extensively used. Previous work has demonstrated the deleterious effects of radio frequency (RF) phase error on channel performance by machine computation of an integral derived by statistically averaging over the phase error. The required receiver performance in estimating the RF phase for detecting binary coherent signals is further examined. Upper and lower bounds are generated which measure the inaccuracy of the familiar performance formula derived from the idealized coherent channel model. The bounds are obtained analytically without resorting to machine computation. The Tikhonov probability distribution for the RF reference phase error is used. The principal result is the relation\\sigma_{\\varpi}^{2} \\leq (kE/N_{0})^{-1}where\\sigma_{\\varpi}^{2}is the variance in the error of the derived carrier phase,E/N_{0}is the energy (per uncoded symbol) to noise density ratio required by the ideal coherent channel, andkis a factor relating to the tolerable degradation in error rate as given by the bounds. Ifkis on the order of 3 the symbol error rate no more than doubles; in general akof 10 will suffice for no degradation in error rate."
"Improvements in electronic color scanners appear possible by replacing current light sources with coherent radiation from lasers with much higher radiance. This allows higher speeds of operation (subject to mechanical constraints), greater enlargement capability, and the use of lower sensitivity recording films, or other media. These possibilities were verified experimentally by replacing the reading light source in an RCA color scanner by a combination of argon-ion and He-Ne lasers and the writing light source with an argon-ion laser. The light intensity of the writing light source was modulated by an electrooptic modulator driven from the signal output of the color-correction computer. When this signal was pulsed electronically, it was further possible to directly generate a screened halftone image on the scanner. This is due to the fact that a laser can be operated with a Gaussian spatial energy density distribution. When such a distribution is focused onto a high gamma film, dots are produced whose size is related uniquely to the intensity of the light pulse."
"The multipath model evaluated is of a three-component-two-path type. In several space channels we have a directtransmission path and a reflected-transmission path. The direct component can be described as specular, while the reflection is a composition of both a specular component and one that is diffuse. The channel bit error probability for noncoherent wide-band frequency-shift keying (FSK) is obtained for such channels. It is shown that parameters such as rate of fade, Doppler, and data rate relative to the delay between the two transmission paths affects the system performance significantly."
"The results of a recent study to determine and evaluate effective methods of applying forward-acting error-control-coding techniques to multichannel high-frequency (HF) data modems are presented. A unique feature of this study is a conscious exploitation of the fine-grain bit-error behavior, both in time and in frequency, that is characteristic of multichannel HF data transmission systems. Attention is focused on the ability of four promising coding techniques to combat the characteristic error behavior. These techniques involve the use of bit-interleaved binary block codes, diffuse convolutional codes, block-interleaved two-stage concatenated codes with binary-coded inner stages and nonbinary-coded outer stages, and a class of two-stage binary codes with random-error-correcting inner stages and burst-error correcting outer stages."
"The spectra of digital frequency modulation (FM) signals have been observed to be narrow compared with the spectra of digital baseband signals or the corresponding amplitude modulation (AM) and phase modulation (PM) signals. This suggests a high efficiency of transmission in terms of occupied bandwidth for binary FM. Here the desirability of digital FM systems is investigated further with an examination of the probability of bit error. The FM receiver considered consists of a predetection filter, a limiter-discriminator, and a postdetection filter. New results are presented on the effect of predetection bandwidth restriction on the error performance of binary FM systems for various frequency deviations. Theoretical results have been obtained by a Fourier analysis of the distorted FM signals and by Rice's click analysis of FM noise. The data presented permits an optimum selection of system parameters such as frequency deviation ratio and predetection filter bandwidth. It is found that in narrow-band operation a peak-to-peak frequency deviation of about 0.7 times the bit rate and a bandpass filter bandwidth of about 1.0 times the bit rate yield a minimum probability of error. Experimental measurements have been made and there is, in general, good agreement with the theory. A comparison of the error performance of noncoherent binary FM, coherent AM, and coherent PM in a restricted band is made. Narrow-band noncoherent FM proves superior to AM in any bandwidth. In narrow-band operation, the noncoherent FM gives a somewhat better error performance than the coherent PM. For example, for an error rate of 10-4and a bandpass filter bandwidth of one times the bit rate, the performance of a noncoherent FM system is 0.7 dB better than that of a coherent PM system."
"Exact expressions are obtained for the autocorrelation function of a sinusoidal carrier phase- or frequency-modulated by Butterworth-filtered white Gaussian noise. The corresponding power spectra are obtained numerically, together with bounds on the error resulting from truncation of the Fourier integrals. The spectra are relatively inaccurate in the tail regions, where other methods of calculation are more appropriate. The results are compared with estimates based on Woodward's approximation, and it is concluded that, while the latter are valuable for frequency modulation under a wide range of conditions, their usefulness for phase modulation is limited to wide-deviation modulation by high-order spectra."
"Development of the No. 1 Electronic Switching System, a stored program system, by Bell Telephone Laboratories has required considerable program debugging and system testing. The bulk of this effort is done in model telephone offices at the Bell Telephone Laboratories locations in Illinois and New Jersey. However, for some actual telephone offices that are the first of a kind, incorporating Hew program or hardware features, system testing is done at the office itself. To facilitate this remote testing, a means of providing an up-to-date copy of the program at the test site had to be provided. This paper describes a means for meeting this need by use of data transmission over telephone lines. The system uses unique terminal units to provide compatibility between magnetic tape units at laboratory locations and memory writing equipment at the test site. Transmission of error check bits with the data and retransmission of data to correct detected transmission errors is provided."
"The results of a program to design, develop, and build a threshold extending frequency-modulated feedback (FMFB) demodulator which can be used as a universal demodulator is discussed. Its design details are described, as well as the method whereby its loop gain and frequency characteristics are changed. Both the methods by which it was tested and also the test results are described. Comparisons of test results and theoretical limits are described."

"Approximate expressions are calculated for the output signal-to-noise ratios of a balanced frequency discriminator and an unbalanced frequency discriminator. The input is a frequency modulated signal embedded m white Gaussian noise. Nonideal limiting is assumed. The results obtained are valid in the above-threshold region of operation."
"Acceptability of telephone communications over a circuit which included two synchronous orbit satellite links in tandem is the primary subject presented. Round trip delay in the order of 1100 ms was caused by such a circuit, and the question studied was this: wall this phenomenon cause actual users to rate the circuit unacceptable? The users consisted of military and civilian government personnel who were experienced in world-wide telephone communications over military networks. The statistics of almost 200 users revealed that with 99-percent certainty, less than 2 percent of the users will rate the circuit including two synchronous orbit satellite links in tandem unacceptable. The circuit used was equipped with Western Electric Company 3A echo suppressors at both ends. Tests were also performed with circuits including three and four synchronous orbit satellite links in tandem of which the third and fourth satellite links were provided by simulation circuitry. The results in these cases yielded a surprisingly small number of users who rated the circuit unacceptable. A definite change from the normal conversational mode to accomodate the delay accounts for this fact."
"A random sampling scheme is developed for the digital detection of on-off keying. The received (bandpass) signal is sampled randomly; the samples are fed to a coincidence detector, where the modulation is extracted. The random sampling approach, in conjunction with the simple coincidence detector, makes possible a bonafide digital receiver capable of operating at (carrier) frequencies as high as the state of the art in analog-to-digital conversion will allow, with bit rates of the order of 1 MHz. Performance characteristics are derived, and some preliminary conclusions are drawn relative to the practicability of the proposed receiver."
"Some coding schemes of binary signals into ternary signals for asynchronous transmission of digital information are presented. First, an application of differentiated ternary return to zero signals, where every signal is associated with a particular separation signal, to asynchronous transmission is introduced and discussed. Second, coding schemes where successive signals are alike are introduced and also discussed. In these schemes signals may have large intersymbol interferences. Third, in order to minimize intersymbol interference a coding scheme where no two successive pulses may have the same polarity is introduced. The number of code points Nmof lengthmis given by,N_{m} = 2(F_{m} + F_{m-1}), where Fmis in a Fibonacci series\\{F_{i}\\}, i = 1,2,...,m,starting withF_{1} = 1andF_{2} = 2. Thus we call this Fibonacci coding. If the Fibonacci coding is performed on a bit-by-bit basis, the code words derived do not generally have equal length. To avoid this, word-by-word coding is proposed. The power spectrum of the Fibonacci coded signals is calculated theoretically. In all cases, any single error may cause a succession of errors. In order to prevent these errors caused by an error, it is required to achieve stable block or frame synchronization."
 "The bit error probability performance of both frequency-shift-keyed (FSK) and differential phase-shift-keyed (DPSK) binary systems are described when disturbed by an interference consisting of a mixture continuous wave (CW) tone and narrow-band random noise in addition to the usual broad-band thermal noise background. Performance of the two systems is shown to be identical with the exception that the equivalent DPSK performance occurs at 3 dB less signal-to-thermal-noise ratio. The combination of CW tone and noise interference severely degrades system performance under a broad range of conditions."
"This correspondence applies a new bounding technique to a modulation system described in [1]. The new bound gives tighter location of threshold level. The variation of the bound with the degree of phase modulation indicates that a hybrid system gives improved performance for all signal-to-noise ratios."
"In a multichannel picture transmission system data rate reduction can be achieved by multiplexing. The multiplexer essentially consists of a switch which interconnects a particular scanner to the transmission channel. The position of the switch is controlled by features such as significant changes derived from the pictures to be transmitted. Economy seems favorable due to the sharing of most of the equipment."
"Squaring loops are often discussed as a means of establishing a coherent carrier reference for bi-phase PSK modulation. The optimal presquaring filter is derived under the assumptions that the modulating spectrum as narrow with respect to the carrier frequency and that the phase-locked loop bandwidth is much narrower than the modulating spectrum."
"This paper presents some theoretical properties of a predictive quantizing system for the transmission of random signals. Expressions for the mean-squared error are derived for some input processes. It is shown that for the Gaussian case the predictive system gives no improvement over the conventional system. The class of linear Markov processes is also considered, and an example is presented which clearly illustrates the limited region of improvement for the predictive system. The relation of the improvement to the correlation of the input samples is also illustrated."
"The effective signal-to-noise ratio of a phase-shift-keyed pseudonoise/spread-spectrum signal passed through a communication link with phase nonlinearities\\varphi(f)is shown to be a fraction\\langlecos \\varphi(f)\\rangle^{2}of the actual ratio, where\\langle \\dot \\rangledenotes an average formed by weightingcos \\varphi(f)by signal spectral power density across the passband."
"The steady-state behavior of a data-transition tracking loop, used as a bit synchronizer in a phase-coherent receiver, is considered. Optimization of mean-square phase noise and mean time to first cycle slip is performed when the average power of the reference cross-correlating signal is constrained. It is shown that by adjusting the quadrature channel gain along with the integration interval, a significant improvement in phase noise and cycle slip performances can be achieved over that system which integrates in the quadrature channel over the full symbol period. All the results are derived for a first-order loop filter merely to indicate the approach to the problem and the relative value of optimizing the system."
"The properties of subsequences of longmsequences are studied using the moments of the subsequence weight distributions. These moments are shown to be an aid for selecting goodmsequences for correlation-detection problems. In particular, the first four moments are described in detail for subsequence lengthsM \\leq 100digits for six differentmsequences. Two simple algorithms are described for determining the third and fourth moments. An algorithm for calculating the fourth moment and a detailed description of this moment for the sixmsequences are presented in this paper. Using the moments, a relationship is shown between the subsequences of the pseudorandom binary sequence and subsequences composed of random binary digits. Estimates for the moments of the subsequence weight distribution are obtained by sampling themsequence. A statistical analysis of these results is presented."
"This paper analyzes the synchronization error which results when a pseudonoise synchronization signal in a coherent communication link is degraded by both additive white Gaussian noise and amplitude jitter produced by the reference carrier phase error. A synchronization system similar to a phase-locked loop is presented and simulated on a digital computer in order to find the distribution of the synchronization error. It is shown that the error is made up of two Gaussian components: one produced by the additive noise and one produced by the amplitude jitter. An approximate solution is also derived by appropriately bounding the reference phase error. The results are shown to be applicable to several similar systems found in the literature."
"The digital adaptive equalization technique presented is characterized by a relatively simple algorithm and unique design features that permit fast adaptation in the decision-directed mode. For example, at 4800 bit/s the initial error rate in this mode may be as high as 25 percent, yet adaptation is assured. The equalization process is applied to the modified duobinary technique, but the principle is sufficiently general to employ any kind of system-correlative or multilevel. The present model employs primarily large scale integration (LSI), medium scale integration (MSI), and few integrated circuits; no discrete circuitry is included. As a result, simplicity, small size, low cost, and precision are achieved."
"Described is the use of a mini-computer for the communication control procedures, error detection, and data buffering of one to four on-line data terminals. The interface hardware is general and minimal. The character synchronization and control logic is done by software. An error correction scheme of partial record retransmission is developed. The resulting thruput is compared to that of the Idle-RQ system."
"The bandpass limiter is a key component in many communication systems. It is useful to model a bandpass limiter as a cascade combination of a hard limiter and a bandpass filter. If a bandpass signal is input to a bandpass limiter, the output of the hard limiter will be concentrated in an infinite number of spectral bands centered at odd multiples of the input center frequency (fundamental). If the bandpass limiter is assumed to be ideal, its output is then generally assumed to have a constant envelope regardless of the input. Since the hard limiter may give each spectral band an infinite width, the fundamental band can neither be perfectly transmitted by the filter nor can it be perfectly extracted from the other bands. Hence it is impossible to build a device with ideal behavior. Bounds on the envelope fluctuation in the output of a bandpass limiter are developed. If\\sigmaz^{2}is the envelope variance of the bandpass limiter output,\\sigmas^{2}is the envelope variance of the filtered fundamental band, andDis twice the average power at the output of the filter of the sum of all the harmonic bands, then\\sigmas^{2}\\{max [(1 - D^{1/2}/\\sigmas),0]\\}^{2} \\leq \\sigmaz^{2} \\leq \\sigmas^{2} [1 + D^{1/2}/\\sigmas]^{2}. These bounds are apt to be reasonably close estimates of\\sigmaz^{2}whenD^{1/2}/\\sigmasis much less than unity. If an upper boundRforD^{1/2}/\\sigmasis available, a further bound can be derived from the bound given previously by substitution ofRforD^{1/2}/\\sigmas. Such a bound is derived for situations where the limiter output fundamental has finite rms bandwidth. Another such bound is derived for an example where the bandwidth is infinite. In this latter case, the bounds are compared with an exact computation."
"A queuing model with limited waiting room (buffer), batch (burst) Poisson arrivals, and a synchronous server (transmission channel) with constant service time (constant transmission rate) is studied. Using average burst length and traffic intensity as parameters, the relationships among buffer size, overflow probabilities, and an approximation to the expected queuing delay of each burst due to buffering are obtained. These relationships are represented in graphs which provided a guide to the buffer design problem. A simple example is given which applies these results to the design of a buffer system in a time-sharing computer system. Although the problem arose in studies of design of statistical multiplexers, the queuing model developed is quite general and may be useful for other industrial applications."
"There are more than one hundred troposcatter systems of various sizes in existence all over the world [1]. As the transmission of computer data becomes more and more common and in popular demand, such systems are certain to be involved in these services. Two methods are generally used for transmitting data over troposcatter channels: direct transmission and the frequency division multiplex/frequency modulation (FDM/FM) technique. In the latter, the individual data channels are combined into an FDM baseband to frequency or phase modulate a common radio carrierthe same technique used conventionally for the carrier transmission of multiplex telephone channels. In a study program, under a contract [2]-[4] to the U. S. Air Force Rome Air Development Center, both the direct transmission by time-division multiplex/frequency-shift keying (TDMF/SK) and the FDM/FM techniques are investigated. This paper, however, concerns the FDM/FM techniques only. It was found that both theoretically and experimentally FDM/FM troposcatter systems can support data transmission of various rates from 2.4 to 40.8 kbit/s for path lengths from 86.7 to 381.5 statute miles in smooth earth geometry with diversity reception, if proper path and equipment parameters are chosen."
"A gain controlled amplifier capable of transmitting 2700 channels is presented. In the 2700-channel radio relay system, the intermediate frequency (IF) was selected at 140 MHz. An IF main amplifier was required to handle approximately +14 dBm and to realize low distortion-gain control circuits. Conventional variolossers using semiconductor devices induce many harmonics and amplitude modulation-phase modulation (AM-PM) conversion, which relate to transmission distortion. This paper describes design objectives, a technique to reduce the aforementioned defects, and measured characteristics of the amplifier. Field tests of microwave repeaters using these amplifiers proved their utility."
"The steady-state phase noise performance of an absolute value type of early-late gate bit synchronizer is developed using the Fokker-Planck method. The results are compared with the performance of two other commonly used bit synchronizer circuit topologies on the basis of either 1) equal equivalent signal to noise in the loop bandwidth in the linear region, or 2) equal loop bandwidth at each input signal-to-noise ratio Rs. These comparisons are made as a function of Rs. In both cases, the absolute value type of early-late gate yields the best performance (in the sense of minimum phase noise) at every value of Rs."
"The advent of large-scale integration has suggested new approaches to signal processing problems. In the data transmission field, for example, a complete modem can be built entirely of digital circuits. Not only is this approach technically feasible, but it is economically attractive, if the inherent speed of the digital devices is utilized by time-sharing the hardware among a large number of channels. This paper describes, an entirely digital multichannel narrow-band frequency-shift-keying data receiver. Input signals from each channel are converted to digital form and processed sequentially by a time-shared arithmetic umt composed of recursive digital filters. A prototype has been built and tested. If offers performance comparable to existing analog equivalents, while allowing extensive size and cost potential reductions."
"A simple unstable second-order digital filter with one variable multiplier can provide a source of frequency-modulated signals. This modulator is readily time-shared and should prove attractive when a large number of transmitters are required. A system consisting of a multiple installation of identical binary frequency-shift keying data transmitters is described and analyzed. A refinement which totally eliminates amplitude and phase discontinuities is also presented."
"A sequential circuit for the control of an all-digital multiline data set is presented. Such a circuit, operating in conjunction with a digital modulator and demodulator, is necessary to provide the scanning, timing, display, and interface control features associated with the exchange of information betweenmvoice-band communication channels and their associated business machine ports. This paper discusses the design of the control circuit as a sequential machine, traces its development starting with a word statement of the problem in the form of flow diagrams, and ends with the logic equations upon which the hardware design is based."
"In phase-coherent communication systems which use phase-locked loops to provide synchronization of the data detector, the communications engineer is frequently faced with the problem of determining the effects which noisy timing has upon detection efficiency. This paper is concerned with determining these effects when second-order phase-locked loops, operating in the presence of frequency detuning, are used as a means of providing phase synchronization. The results are also applicable to the problem of establishing noisy reference losses in a broad class of coherent PCM telemetry systems, e.g., PCM/PSK/PM. Also presented are results which can be used to determine steady-state statistical dynamics of second-order loops."
"Path intermodulation (IM) data was derived from noise power ratio measurements taken over five tropospheric scatter paths during system acceptance tests. Path lengths of the five links range from 176 to 515 miles, and the links are operated at frequencies of 600 MHz, 900 MHz, or 2 GHz. Path locations vary from a subtropical environment to overland paths near the Arctic circle. The data is presented in the form of scatter plots of path IM versus transmission loss, with a linear least squares fit to each set of data. A regression of path IM on transmission loss is shown for each individual path, and the regression of path IM on transmission loss is shown for all paths as a function of path geometry. A comparison of measured data with prediction indicates that for long paths the magnitude of path IM is usually underestimated."
"An analytical and numerical investigation of the performance characteristics of partially coherent system techniques which consist of 1) the squaring-tracking loop, 2) the pilot-tone tracking loop, and 3) the differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) technique is discussed. Performance characteristics (error probabilities) are obtained under a unified receiving systems framework, with commonality expressed in terms of the receiver data and reference acquisition channel bandwidths and equal total transmitted power conditions. The modulation addressed is binary phase-shift keying (PSK), operating over a Gaussian noise channel with nonstationary phase characteristics. System performance is expressed analytically, computed numerically, and illustrated graphically with the following conclusions. The squaring-tracking loop technique provides the best performance and closely approximates coherent PSK performance when reference smoothing over several bauds is employed. The performance of the squaringtracking loop system and the DPSK system are comparable within a decibel for tracking loop averaging over 1 baud. Performance of the pilot-tone system depends critically upon the tracking loop bandwidth and the power allocation between pilot carrier and information sidebands. In no case considered does the pilot-tone system outperform the squaring-tracking loop system. On the basis of minimum error rate, the systems can be ranked as follows: 1) the squaring-tracking loop system, 2) DPSK, and 3) the pilottone system. At large signal-to-noise ratios, pilot-tone systems can outperform DPSK."
"It is well known that the optimum receiver for pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) signals, transmitted over a single channel, consists of a cascade of continuous and transversal filters. It is shown that an extended structure of this type is also optimum for the completely general case ofMmultiplexed PAM signals transmitted over random-time and frequency-dispersive multichannel systems withIinputs andNoutputs, where each output is subjected to arbitrarily correlated additive noise. The random channels may also be arbitrarily correlated. In general, the receiver consists ofMNcontinuous filters andMtapped delay lines with M2sets of taps. An adaptive version is also described. The results include, as special cases, the situations considered by Gonsalves and Tufts [8], Shnidman [5], and Kaye [3]. Also, included as special cases are new results for diversity systems, multi-input systems such as multipair cables, and multiple-terminal systems such as multiple access repeaters in which cochannel interference occurs."
"Algorithms are given to synthesize optimally invulnerable directed graphs with an arbitrary number of vertices and a minimum number of branches. We give a decomposition of these graphs into a class of subgraphs called step-lcycles, of which a directed Hamilton cycle is a special case. The use of this property in simultaneouskcommodity flows is demonstrated."
"The problem of designing networks that can survive an enemy attack or natural disaster has received considerable attention in recent years. Work in this area has focused on the formulation of survivability criteria, the development of analysis methods to rank networks with respect to these criteria, and the generation of networks which are optimal with respect to these criteria. Many partial results for a variety of network models are available. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the most significant of these results, to link various models and approaches, and to indicate areas of study in which additional research seems both desirable and feasible."
"An analysis of the performance of a synchronous digital communications system in which the clock rate of each station is established as the average of the clock rates of all incoming signals to each station is presented. Using both-end control, the system frequency is the average of the free-running frequencies of the phase locked oscillators, weighted by the number of inputs to each station. In single-end control, the frequency is a similar average plus a term, which is a function of changes in transmission path delay. Rules are derived defining how a transmision path delay change will be reflected in changes of total phase difference at each transmission path terminal. These phase changes reflect requirements for elastic storage of data at each transmission path termination. The dynamic stability of a simple two station network is analyzed mathematically. A subsequent technical paper [7] will report on the extensive analysis of the dynamic behavior of various system configurations using a computer simulation of the time history response to various perturbations."
"Using the requirements of a quantized multiple access voice communications system as a base, an investigation of several methods of modulation was conducted. Two frequency modulation (FM) techniques and one amplitude modulation (AM) technique were investigated in detail. The AM technique is the quantized pulse position modulation-AM (QPPM-AM) method used in the U. S. Army random access-discrete address (RADA) communications system. The quantized FM techniques were investigated as possible alternates to the RADA technique. Comparisons between the techniques are made in the areas of required transmitter power, RF bandwidth, circuit complexity, and several other areas relevant to communications systems of this type. The results indicate superior performance of one FM technique in several areas."
"To overcome many difficulties besetting the design of a cost-effective stored-program telephone switch control, this paper proposes a systematic three-step approach: 1) selection from twelve basic subclasses of a software organization satisfying flexibility, reliability, and speed-of-service constraints; 2) estimation of program size and processing load assuming a rudimentary processor architecture; and 3) determination of an optimal stored-program-wired-logic boundary and a minimum cost processor architecture. The last step is simplified by using a quantitative criterion called speed-size ratio."
"In several space relay communication channels signal energy can be described as following two transmission paths. The first is the direct path from the transmitter to the receiver in which the signal is corrupted only by additive Gaussian noise. The second is the reflected path involving a reflection boundary, which may distort and delay the signal in that path. At the receiver the combined signal from the two paths exhibits multipath effects (primarily signal fading). In addition, substantial Doppler is frequently encountered so that the carrier frequency can be treated as a random variable. This paper describes a detailed mathematical model of this channel. This allows one to study the effects of such important parameters as Doppler, rate of fade, diversity, and the degree of correlation between the direct and reflected path transmission. The envelope of the reflect signal is assumed to be statistically described as a Rician random process and the modulation is assumed to be frequency shift keying (FSK). The model is used to derive performance equations for this system. It was found that a priori knowledge of the nature of the fade is necessary to determine whether diyersity is advantageous. Thus, for example, reflections from extremely smooth boundaries (specular reflections) show small degradations in performance with the use of diversity, while for most diffuse reflection cases, a significant improvement can be achieved through the use of diversity."

"In this paper we introduce the concept of a quasisingle-sideband frequency modulation (SSB-FM) signal and show that this signal has approximately the same bandwidth as an SSB-FM signal but does not fade and peak as sharply as an ordinary SSB-FM signal. The threshold of a sinusoidally modulated SSB-FM signal is calculated and is shown to be significantly poorer than the threshold of an ordinary FM signal. In addition, the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) above threshold is calculated for a Gaussian modulated SSB-FM signal. The output SNR is smaller than that obtained for ordinary FM. It is concluded that SSB-FM offers many disadvantages and few advantages when compared to FM."
"Earlier results are applied to a class of random input signals possessing a certain symmetry, yielding a generalized expression for the mean-square error as well as a relation for the equivalent gain."
"The mutual coupling effects on anM-branch maximumratio combiner with correlated signal fading in general are considered. The results in the mobile radio case show that the average power delivered to the receiver becomes less as the antenna spacing of an antenna array decreases (i.e., the mutual coupling increases) with either an optimum load network or an optimum resistive load network connected to the antenna array at the front end of the receiver. However, there is not much effect on the power as long as the antenna spacing is equal to or greater than a certain value dependent on the number of the branchesM. ForM \\leq 4, the required antenna spacing is equal or greater than 0.2λ. The value forM > 4increases gradually asMincreases. It can be obtained following the same technique. The mutual coupling effect on the cumulative distribution of the signal from anMbranch mobile diversity array is also small. Hence for an in-line array withM \\leq 4, the antenna spacing of 0.2λ can still provide most of the usual diversity advantage."
"The effects of fading on the error-rate performance of a multihop line-of-sight PCM radio system, operated with or without diversity, are theoretically analyzed. A set of approximate formulas for the distribution of error probability has been established. These formulas can be used to determine the necessary carrier-to-noise power ratio in a noncoherent frequency-shift keying or coherent phase-shift keying system in order to meet the specified error probability and percent outage time."
"A central office crossbar switching system with functionally separate electronic common control units is described. The common control subsystem is divided into routing control, trunk supervision control, and data storage functions. Routing control is performed by a stored program controlled electronic processor. Trunk supervision control is accomplished on an optional basis either by a common wired logic electronic control unit or by logic in individual trunk circuits which can have access to the routing control processor for trunk identifying purposes. Data storage is provided in electrically alterable ferrite core memory banks. All common control subsystems are redundant with automatic switchover in case of failure. Crossbar switches are used in the switching matrix. Marker logic and simple switching functions in trunk and receiver/sender circuits are designed with conventional relay techniques. The switching system incorporates new custom calling and Centrex features. It provides for improved administrative capabilities and can be used as an integral part to expand an existing electromechanical crossbar system in an evolutionary fashion."
"The noise bandwidth BNof Butterworth, Bessel, and Chebyshev filters is tabulated. The Butterworth filter is shown to have the minimum BNto 3-dB bandwidth ratio for any secondorder filter. It is proven that BNis invariant when a low-pass to bandpass transformation is made. An error is corrected in recent tables of Chebyshev filters."
"Assuming bit errors are independently distributed with a constant probability of error pe, it is shown that a simple estimator is highly efficient for estimation of pe. The estimator is based on a simple function of the number of sync words containing no bit errors. The estimator is shown to be maximum likelihood, minimum chi-square, and modified minimum chi-square when the quality index reported is simply the percent of frames containing zero errors. An approximate confidence interval for peis obtained, and a determination of the number of sync words to observe in order to obtain an approximate confidence interval of fixed length is indicated. The method of scoring which can be used to obtain a more efficient estimator of peis described."
"Low data rate communications are of considerable interest for applications in which the received signal-to-noise ratio is very low. At data rates below the neighborhood of 5 bit/s, coherent communication techniques become inefficient, and noncoherent techniques such asm-ary frequency shift keying (MFSK) become attractive. In this paper, the design of an MFSK low data rate communication system is discussed. The problems of synchronization in time and frequency are analyzed, and experimental results of successful laboratory tests of the system are presented."
"This paper is a sequel to a previous paper which considered the error performance of binary DPSK transmission for the case of noise and general cochannel interferences. The present work extends that analysis to include multiphase signaling. Whereas the binary analysis produced exact expressions for the probability of error, the extension toM-ary DPSK considered here leads to upper and lower bounds to the symbol error probability. The bounds have a ratio of 2. However, by a heuristic argument it is possible to estimate the proximity of the error probability to one of the bounds, and so the uncertainty in the approximation is small enough to make the results quite usable for systems design. Computations are displayed for quaternary (M = 4) single difference (conventional) DPSK."
"This paper explores various factors to be considered in the application of computer techniques to radio engineering functions. A general outline of the radio engineer functions related to system performance, layout engineering, frequency coordination, and administration are included. The interrelationship of the decision parameters of manpower, economics, work volume, work complexity, and computer development are discussed. Consideration is given to the productivity and economic aspects of computer application. Some potential problem areas are reviewed."
"A digital coded facsimile system has been developed employing redundancy reduction techniques to reduce the timebandwidth product requirement over conventional facsimile by a factor of 5 to 1 for an average complexity document. Experimental results are presented which illustrate the feasibility of technique using subframe variable velocity raster scanning, fiber optics contact printing, and a simple, but efficient, coding algorithm whose choice was based on the results of an extensive statistical analysis program. The terminal operates at two data speeds 50 Kbit/s and 4800 bit/s and can transmit an average8\\frac{1}{2}- by ll-inch document, scanned at 135 lines per inch resolution in 7 seconds over group channels and in 70 seconds over voice bandwidth channels."
"Loss of Synchronization may have a number of effects on the decoding process of a convolutional code. At best there will be a transient effect on the decoder; at worst error propagation will be initiated; or the information sent Will be made worthless by a loss or gain of digits during transmission. A method for detecting and correcting slippage similar to that used for cyclic codes will be examined and applied to certain Specific convolutional codes. This method is such that there is no change in the code when synchronization is maintained. Only a modest amount of added hardware is needed. The procedures developed are applicable to codes wheren-data streams are sent in parallel. For interlaced serial streams, slippage correction ofsdigits can be corrected ifsis a multiple ofn; otherwise slippage can be detected."
"Specially designed HF ionospheric propagation measurements were made and analyzed to confirm the validity and bandwidth limitations of a proposed stationary HF ionospheric channel model. In the model, the input (transmitted) signal feeds an ideal delay line and is delivered at several taps with adjustable delays, one for each resolvable ionospheric modal component. Each delayed signal is modulated in amplitude and phase by a baseband tap-gain function, and the delayed and modulated signals are summed (with additive noise) to form the output (received) signal. Statistical specifications for the tap-gain functions involved three hypotheses: 1) that each tap-gain function is a complexGaussian process that produces Rayleigh fading, 2) that the tapgain functions are independent, and 3) that each tap-gain function has a spectrum that in general is the sum of two Gaussian functions of frequency, one for each magnetoionic component. Statistical tests were performed on daytime and nighttime measurements confirming the validity of the three hypotheses, and thereby the validity of the model. For practical applications, the model can be considered valid over a bandwidth equal to about one fourth of the reciprocal of the effective (weighted) time spreads on the ionospheric modal components. The model should be useful both in theoretical analyses of communication system performance and for channel simulator designs."
"Expressions and curves of error probabilities of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) and noncoherent frequency shift keying (FSK) are obtained as a function of the pulse carrier frequency offset. These indicate that the frequency offset which causes the DPSK error probability to be larger than the FSK error probability is approximately\\Delta\\omegaT= 0.74. This crossover frequency appears to be a linear function of the signal-to-noise ratio over the range-4 dB to 14 dB. The crossover point is extended by sub-bit processing and the previous curves are modified for this case."
"It is shown that the expected number of clicks per second at the output of a conventional frequency modulation discriminator is smaller than the number given by Rice [1]. In any analysis of the discriminator the difference is small, and it does not affect the output signal-to-noise ratio appreciably. However, m the analysis of threshold extending demodulators, which remove a large number of clicks, the difference can become very important. The predicted results are experimentally verified using a simple but novel technique."
"A synchronization technique for use with noisy digital waveforms is developed. This is accomplished by determining a relationship for the evolution of the joint probability density of the epoch of the bit sequence and the bit sequence itself. A bit by bit decision criterion is then determined which is the optimum sequential estimator."
"This paper describes a system using an electronic stored program processor and ferrite core data memories to implement the routing control functions of a common control crossbar telephone central office. Of central importance to the design is provision for the system to be applicable both for new installations and for expanding existing offices without obsoleting equipment already in service. Processor hardware characteristics and maintenance features are discussed along with interface circuits, inputoutput equipment, and relay adapters. Operation of the system for routing of calls through the network is explained. Modularity of the system is such that it can be economically configured to encompass a wide range of office sizes. Provisions for achieving this modularity are discussed. Reliability considerations and switchover philosophy are explained for the system which has internal redundancy with duplicated processors."

 "Provides an overview of the technical articles and features presented in this issue."
"A method for recursively determining the Laplace transform of the state transition matrix for a linear time-invariant system is presented. The method does not require matrix inversion, nor does the complexity of the operations involved increase with the dimensionality of the system. It is equally applicable to systems with distinct or multiple roots."
 "The maximum likelihood estimation of the coefficients of multiple output linear dynamical systems and the noise correlations from the noisy measurements of input and output are discussed. Conditions are derived under which the estimates converge to their true values as the number of measurements tend to infinity. The computational methods are illustrated by several numerical examples."
   "An identification procedure for determination of coefficients of pulse transfer function is proposed. This procedure is applicable for the case when measurement noises of input and output are independent of input to a process and the variances of the noises are known only in the form of the ratio. The noises can be colored. The criterion used for identification is given by extending the mean-square equation error. The optimal estimates are obtained from the eigenvector of a linear operator which corresponds to the least eigenvalue. The theoretical analysis is given and the direction for the practical usage is suggested to use the least-square error criterion."
"The problem of identifying Green's function of a linear time-invariant distributed parameter system is considered. A discrete lumped version of the distributed system is developed for which a pointwise approximation of Green's function is the state transition matrix. A stochastic approximation algorithm is presented for the identification of the pointwise approximation of Green's function in the presence of additive measurement noise."
"The theory of nonlinear filtering (Stratonovitch, Kushner, and Bucy) is applied 1) to real-time identification of the covariance matrix of the input noise in the process model used by Kalman and Bucy [1] and 2) to adaptive mechanization of the matrix Riccati equation and the gain matrix in the Kalman-Bucy filter."
"A linear differential game whose payoff is determined by a convex function of the state vector at a given terminal time is investigated. An explicit expression for the greatest lower bound of the value of the game is obtained. A simple condition which guarantees the existence of the value of the game is derived by a geometric approach. Under this condition, instead of solving the Bellman equation, the value of the game can be calculated by maximizing a function on the unit sphere of the output space whose dimension is usually much less than that of the state space. The method of synthesizing the optimal strategies is also derived. Another game called a minimax energy game whose payoff is given by the difference between the consumed energies of both players is treated briefly, and an extension of the concept of controllability is discussed."
"The problem of designing a compensator to obtain arbitrary pole placement in the system consisting of the plant and compensator in cascade is considered. The design uses only those state variables which can be measured. It is shown that for a controllable observable plant a compensator of order\\beta = \\min(\\nu_{c} - 1, \\nu_{o} - 1)is sufficient to achieve this result. Here\\nu_{c}(\\nu_{o})is the controllability (observability) index of the plant. This result is obtained by first showing that any multi-input multi-output linear time-invariant system may be made controllable (observable) from a single input (output) using only output feedback. The main result is then proved in a constructive manner which explicitly relates the compensator parameters to the coefficients of the desired characteristic polynomial."
"A recursive estimation scheme suitable for real-time implementation is derived for a class of nolinear systems and observations expressed as nonlinear functions in discrete time, corrupted by a non-Gaussian mutually correlated random white noise sequence. The probability densities are expanded as a Gram-Charlier series and a Gauss-Hermite quadrature formula is used for computing the expectations. In the multidimensional case an expansion about a density of mutually independent Gaussian variables is used instead of a general multidimensional Gaussian density, which may result in a poorer performance in linear systems with Gaussian noise. However, in the case of nonlinear systems and non-Gaussian noise, the computational simplifications which result, outweigh the impairment in performance if any. A computational example is included."
"Let the measurementz(i)at instantibe of formz(i) = y(i) + \\eta(i)where\\eta(i)is the noise andy(i)is the signal obeying a system of coupled linear difference equations. A method is given for computing the gains of the predictor and filter for the signaly(i)and the corresponding statex(i). The gains are computed recursively from the previous gains without involving the covariance matrix of the state. The computational advantages of the scheme are also discussed."
"Stability regions for induction motors are plotted by using the linearized equations of the machine. The parametric plane stability criterion which is extensively used for the study of control systems has been employed. This method gives valuable information on the bounds of the different machine parameters which are essential for the design."
"Engels described in the gain versus phase plane the behavior of a complicated on-off nonlinearity-limited-range integrator driven by a tristable characteristic. The same system is studied here in the complex plane, allowing simpler results. Two curves are also drawn which summarize the working of this nonlinear system."
"An automatic method is presented for the identification of time delays and parameters in linear systems. It is assumed that processes to be identified can be described by linear differential-difference equations. Unknown parameters in these equations are determined by a continuous steepest descent minimization of an error function. If the process parameters are constant, a region exists in the parameter space in which the tracking paramters converge to the process parameters. If all process time delays are known as well, the tracking parameters will always converge. Two examples are presented which show that the method may be used to identify slowly varying parameters. A third example indicates techniques leading to a more economical implementation of the method."
"A general result in linear system theory concerning the controllability and observability of multi-input multi-output systems is presented. Specifically, it is shown that any controllable observable linear system can be made controllable from any input and observable from any output using output feedback."
"Work concerned with the state estimation in linear discrete-time systems operating in Markov dependent switching environments is discussed. The disturbances influencing the system equations and the measurement equations are assumed to come from one of several Gaussian distributions with different means or variances. By defining the noise in this manner, periodic step changes in the inputs which cannot be feasibly measured for economic or technical reasons can be detected and corrected. These changes can be in the amplitudes of the inputs or in the variances of stochastic inputs. A Bayes estimation procedure is applied to the problem of filtering the observations of the system so that an estimate of the system state is obtained. Computer simulations for the optimal and suboptimal estimators are also presented."
"A class of singular control problems is made nonsingular by the addition of an integral quadratic functional of the control to the cost functional; a parameter\\epsilon > 0multiplies this added functional. The resulting nonsingular problem is solved for a monotonically decreasing sequence\\{\\epsilon; \\epsilon_{1} > \\epsilon_{2} > ... > \\epsilon_{k} > 0\\}. Ask \\rightarrow \\inftyand\\epsilon_{k} \\rightarrow 0the solution of the modified problem tends to the solution of the original singular problem. A variant of the method which does not require that\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0is also presented. Four illustrative numerical examples are described."
"Satisfaction of the generalized Legendre-Clebsch condition is known to be a necessary condition of optimality in singular control problems. Recently, a new additional necessary condition of optimality was discovered. In this note, we demonstrate by means of an example that together these two necessary conditions are, in general, insufficient for optimality in singular control problems."
"An approach using statistical linearization to an optimization problem for stochastic systems with bounded control is presented. The cost functional to be minimized is the stationary expectation of a quadratic function of the state and control variables. The class of control laws to be considered is a nonlinear function (saturation or bang-bang) of a linear combination of the state variables. Via linearization, the problem is then reduced to a parameter optimization problem. For the class of saturation functions, a property of the linearized gain is used to establish the unique minimum of the cost functional. The solution for the class of the bang-bang control functions is obtained by a technique using a Lagrange multiplier."
"The optimal control of linear time-invariant systems with respect to a quadratic performance criterion is discussed. The problem is posed with the additional constraint that the control vectoru(t)is a linear time-invariant function of the output vectory(t) (u(t) = -Fy(t))rather than of the state vectorx(t). The performance criterion is then averaged, and algebraic necessary conditions for a minimizingF\\astare found. In addition, an algorithm for computingF\\astis presented."
"The optimal control of a system whose transitions through time are described by a finite state stationary Markov chain is studied. It is assumed that there are two boundary states which are to be avoided and a single calibration state to which the system is contolled by resetting. The determination of an optimal reset policy is formulated as an ordinary linear programming problem. It is shown that under certain symmetry and regularity conditions the optimal control rule has a simple and intuitive structure, while examples are given to show that relaxation of these conditions leads to the need for more complex control."
"The problem of assigning pulses of an array radar which is engaged in tracking a possibly large number of targets simultaneously is discussed. It is assumed that the various targets may follow different trajectories and that the tracks are initiated and completed at possibly different times in each case. An arbitrary but known configuration of targets is treated. The problem is first formulated as a discrete-time dynamic optimization problem with constraints. The applicability of the discrete-time maximum principle to this problem is established, and necessary conditions for optimality are derived. This results in a set of coupled matrix two-point boundary value problems. An algorithm is then suggested for the solution of these equations. Several examples are included to illustrate the application of the results."
"Applying nonlinear filtering techniques to the attitude computation in a strapdown inertial navigation system is discussed. A special class of nonlinear filtering problems is formulated to accommodate the physical problem involving the attitude computation. Recursive filtering algorithms which take advantage of the special characteristics of this mathematical model are derived. Numerical works based on the Monte Carlo simulation are given and comparisons are made with a commonly used algorithm."
"It is shown that the minimization of\\parallel k \\parallel_{2}with respect to λ results in a set ofmequations which are linear in (m - 1) lambdas and nonlinear in the minimum time. These equations can also be obtained by satisfying the terminal conditions subject to the condition,\\lambda \\cdot e_{d} = 1."
"The viewpoint that a hysteresis synchronous motor operates similar to a phase-locked loop of the type common in communications applications is discussed. This viewpoint leads to a simple electrical equivalent circuit model for the motor. The model adequately describes the motor's motion with respect to synchronism and, specifically, the well-known hunting characteristic phenomenon. The motor's hunting characteristic cannot be tolerated in systems which require very accurate speed control. It is then necessary to employ external phase-lock control to eliminate the motor's hunting. A two-loop approach is suggested which effectively dampens the motor's response to a torque disturbance. A classical linear analysis of the motor embedded within the control system is given. The results of the analysis establish the overall response as being virtually independent of the motor's hunting characteristic, i.e., in the absence of transport lag. It is further shown that transport lag within the loop eventually limits the system's performance."
"A stochastic analog of the Newton-Raphson gradient search method may be used under certain conditions to accelerate convergence of a stochastic approximation algorithm to a local minimum. The method depends upon an iterative technique for determining the Hessian matrix. This paper presents a simplified algorithm which in some design problems sharply reduces the calculations required to determine the matrix. An application of this method to an attitude controller is explored in detail."
"A linear discrete-time system with constant coefficients has an information pattern that does not grow in complexity with time, an information state. This paper shows that a particular canonical form for such systems, the phase-variable model, retains this property when coefficients vary as Gaussian time series with rational spectra. The distribution of the output conditional on past data is normal, and its parameters, being functions of the information state, can be calculated in real time in a simple way. The property is fundamental for effective optimal control. A priori characteristics for the Gaussian time series must be specified, but a maximum likelihood method is proposed for estimating any unknown characteristics from a long sample of input-output data. Also, a parameter-free statistic is found for testing the validity of the phase-variable model in actual cases."
"The random-input describing function is the best linear approximation to an instantaneous nonlinearity in the sense of minimum mean-squared error. It is shown here that the describing function also satisfies a more comprehensive criterion which is important to the accuracy of approximate analysis and synthesis techniques for systems with nonlinear elements."
"It is shown that a fairly general class of nonlinear control laws is optimal (with respect to a certain class of functionals) for a large class of nonlinear systems. The work generalizes previous studies on the optimization of asymmetrical space vehicles."
"An algorithm is developed for determining a sub-optimal control of a linear time-invariant system with incomplete feedback. The set of admissible controls is constrained to be a constant linear feedback control of the system output. The merits of the control thus developed relative to that of known techniques are discussed, and two examples are solved to illustrate the method."
"A general first-order example for an optimally sensitive system is considered. It exhibits two interesting properties: the optimal control is a constant, and it has an explicit solution."
"The origin of multiple constraints on a control function in both lumped and distributed systems is investigated. Equivalence and comparability notions are discussed. It is pointed out that multiple constraints have a special significance in optimal control problems of infinite-dimensional systems."
"Sufficient conditions for the one-dimensional time intercept problem are derived for two multi-input systems where the admissible control vectors belong to either hyperspheres or hypercubes."
"The pertinent algorithms are developed for determining the steady-state covariance matrices associated with continuous measurement Kalman filtering, prediction, and smoothing of time-invariant systems. The formulas represent closed-form solutions to the problem as opposed to recursively derived asymptotic solutions. They can be used as a single unified set of algorithms."
"In a recent paper Johnson [1] outlined certain qualitative equivalences between linear deterministic control systems and linear stochastic optimal control systems. This note analyzes the equivalence properties in more detail and establishes a theorem on the inverse stochastic optimal control problem. This theorem is equivalent to Kalman's circle criterion [2] for the restricted stationary case."
"A method of describing systems by sets of second-order differential equations is suggested. In this second-order state-space formulation the states are defined in a manner slightly different from the conventional one. It is shown that this modified procedure reduces the order of matrices, renders easier the evaluation of the characteristic equation and the system solution, and provides some additional insight into the relative stability of system states. Procedures of characterization and analysis of systems by this modified method are indicated, and an example is considered to illustrate the advantageous features of the method in contrast with the normal procedure."
"This correspondence deals with a method for generating a discrete Volterra type series expansion for certain non-linear difference equations describing a class of nonlinear discrete-data systems. The method permits the formulation of a criterion for the convergence of the series via the contraction mapping principle."
"In a previous paper [1], a new method called the dual input discrete describing function (DIDDF) was presented, which enables one to determine the minimum amplitude of sinusoidal dither to be applied, to stabilize a relay type sampled-data control system. In this correspondence Popov's method is used to find the minimum amplitude of the dither to be applied to quench the limit cycles occurring in relay type nonlinear control systems. Furthermore, the dependence of the minimum value of the dither on sampling time is explicitly seen in Popov's method."
"The controllability, observability, and canonical decomposition of a class of linear systems is considered. The zero input system is constant, and the zero state system is time varying. The elements of the input matrix are assumed to be polynomials of time. Controllability of composite systems is also discussed. The results are similar to those presented in [3]."
"Comparison between a system identification method using the fast Fourier transform and one which is optimal is made. The comparison shows that for systems with long settling times the transform method possesses computational advantages but at the cost of accuracy."
"The irreducibilities of dynamical equation realizations of sets of linear time-invariant differential equationsD(p)y(t) = N(p)u(t)are studied. It is demonstrated that a realization ofD(p)y(t) = N(p)u(t)can be irreducible only if the degree of the determinant ofD(s)is equal to the degree of the rational matrixD^{-1}(s)N(s)."
"In a recent paper, Wonham and Morse [1] have presented geometric conditions for the localization of disturbances in multivariable systems. In this correspondence, some algebraic conditions for this problem are presented. In addition, a state feedback matrix for disturbance localization is presented. Contrary to the result in [1], the conditions presented here are only sufficient. However, they do establish an interesting correspondence between the decoupling and disturbance localization problems for multivariable systems. In fact, it is shown that if the scale matrix for the disturbance satisfies a null space property, then the state feedback matrix of a particular matrix pair which decouples a system localizes its disturbances."
"The problem of expanding the matrix equationPA + A'P = - Qinto a system of algebraic equations is considered. Starting from the previously published results, it suggests an alternate approach which is rather simple and very effective in computer applications. This approach is particularly useful when the given equation has to be solved iteratively which is the case in solution of the algebraic matrix Riccati equation appearing in optimal control problems."
"A class of random binary signals have statistical properties which can be considered a first approximation to the Gaussian ones. These binary signals are suggested to be used for the identification of nonlinear systems. For that a design of a cross correlator is proposed which takes advantage of the simplicity in handling these signals."
"The effect of a zero in the right-half plane on the controller derived through the stability theorem of Lyapunov is considered through a simple illustrative example. It is shown that the controller should have the form of a linear saturating function instead of the bang-bang form for the minimum-phase systems."
"Singular fuel-optimal solutions are considered for a class of nonlinear systems with differentiable nonlinearity. A partial differential equation is derived, which must be satisfied by the nonlinearity if singular solutions are to be possible."
"The transformed state equation is used to determine switching times fornth-order optimal control problems, provided that the control is bang-bang with a maximum ofn - 1switches."
"A method of designing linear regulators with incomplete state feedback has been suggested by Rekasius [1]. Ramar and Ramaswami [2] have pointed out the difficulties encountered in applying this method. This correspondence presents, briefly, an alternative approach to this problem in two cases of a) unknown initial state and b) known initial state statistics, viz., mean and covariance matrix. Solution for the control law utilizing only the available states is obtained by minimizing an upper bound on the ratio of the suboptimal to optimal cost in case a). In case b), the expected value of the suboptimal cost is minimized. It is assumed that the available states are sufficient to make the feedback system stable. The solution is in the form of necessary conditions and results in a set of simultaneous polynomial equations but the solution to the optimal control problem is not required."

"A region in the complex plane is given so that the translation of the coordinate axes into it will make all the coefficients of a polynomial nonzero. Moreover, some stopping criteria are obtained which effect the critical transition between the quotient-difference (QD) algorithm and methods with a higher order of convergence."
"A saturating nonlinearity contained in a stable feedback system can be considered to lie within the sector [\\varepsilon,k]. Thus all the well-known Popov-type stability criteria are applicable for the saturating nonlinear feedback system."
"Stability of a distributed parameter system which is described by nonlinear parabolic equations with constant coefficients is studied by using Lyapunov's method. Sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability of the null solution are reduced to the conditions related to the system matrices and the positive definite condition of a certain matrix in the frequency domain."
"Some earlier results [1] are extended to a mode of control for the system\\ddot{\\theta}(t) - M_{\\alpha}\\theta(t) = \\ddot{\\theta}_{T} u(t)when the command is zero, that is, the on-off-on limit-cycle mode which is quite popular with missile control designers. Measures which describe the performance of this system during the on-off-on mode are tabulated as functions of the limit-cycle's switching amplitudes\\theta_{s}and\\dot{\\theta}_{s}. An application is given."

"In a recent paper, a sufficient condition for controllability (observability) of two systems connected in tandem having the most general Jordan form of representation was given. In this correspondence, a counterexample to this sufficient condition is given and further assumptions under which this condition is necessary as well as sufficient are indicated."
"Using the Popov approach, new absolute stability conditions in multiplier form are derived for a single-loop system with a time-invariant stable linear elementGin the forward path and a nonlinear time-varying gaink(t)\\phi(\\dot)in the feedback path. The classes of nonlinearities considered are the monotonic, odd monotonic, and power law. The stability multiplier contains causal and noncausal terms; for absolute stability, the latter give rise to a lower bound (which is believed to be new) ondk/dtand the former, as in earlier investigations, to an upper bound ondk/dt. Asymptotic stability conditions for a linear system are realized as a limiting case of the absolute stability conditions derived for the power law nonlinearity."
"The basic concept of learning control is introduced. The following five learning schemes are briefly reviewed: 1) trainable controllers using pattern classifiers, 2) reinforcement learning control systems, 3) Bayesian estimation, 4) stochastic approximation, and 5) stochastic automata models. Potential applications and problems for further research in learning control are outlined."
"In a previous paper [1], the conventional optimal linear regulator theory was extended to accommodate the case of external input disturbances\\omega(t)which are not directly measurable but which can be assumed to satisfyd^{m+1}\\omega(t)/dt^{m+1} = 0, i.e., represented asmth-degree polynomials in timetwith unknown coefficients. In this way, the optimal controlleru^{0}(t)was obtained as the sum of: 1) a linear combination of the state variablesx_{i}, i = 1,2,...,n, plus 2) a linear combination of the first(m + 1)time integrals of certain other linear combinations of the state variables. In the present paper, the results obtained in [1] are generalized to accommodate the case of unmeasurable disturbances\\omega(t)which are known only to satisfy a given\\rhoth-degree linear differential equationD: d^{\\rho}\\omega(t)/dt^{\\rho} + \\beta_{\\rho}d^{\\rho-1}\\omega(t)/dt^{\\rho-1}+...+\\beta_{2}d\\omega/dt + \\beta_{1}\\omega=0where the coefficients\\beta_{i}, i = 1,...,\\rho, are known. By this means, a dynamical feedback controller is derived which will consistently maintain state regulationx(t) \\approx 0in the face of any and every external disturbance function\\omega(t)which satisfies the given differential equationD-even steady-state periodic or unstable functions\\omega(t). An essentially different method of deriving this result, based on stabilization theory, is also described, In each cases the results are extended to the case of vector control and vector disturbance."
"The measurement problem in distributed system feedback is posed as an observability question. Sensor location and the information content of the resulting signals relative to a partial differential equation model are the primary questions. A new definition of observability is introduced which allows the specification of the space-time domain where the system is observable. The definition is also applied to the problem of observing a particular set of solution modes. Observability results are given for particular classes of equations. Examples indicate a rationale for using the results in selecting measurement locations in distributed systems."
"This paper presents a method for designing an approximate minimal time closed-loop controller for linear systems with bounded control amplitudes and rates. The method is based on obtaining an approximate functional expression (explicitly in terms of the state variables) that describes the minimal time isochrones of the system. This expression is obtained by a series of least-squares fits to the computed system states on the various isochrones. The computation of the system states on the isochrones and the determination of the approximate expressions are achieved off-line. For on-line operation, it is only required to store a limited number of coefficients of the approximate expressions, and to compute the closed-loop control function by some algebraic manipulation. Consequently, the on-line computer storage requirement as well as the on-line computation requirement is relatively small. Thus, the method is feasible for high-order practical systems. To evaluate its usefulness in applications, the scheme is used to design a fourth-order Ranger Block III Attitude Control System. The results are compared to those obtained by applying the minimal time open-loop control."
"The structure of a matrix derivative on a matrix valued function is defined. Matrix product and chain rules are developed which provide significant simplifications for obtaining derivatives of compound matrix structures, and some closed-form structures for Taylor's expansions of a matrix in terms of derivatives and elements of a second matrix are given."
"A method is proposed by which a large linear dynamical system can be reduced to a number of simplified models by dividing the total time of response into a number of smaller intervals. This reduction is based on retaining only those eigenvalues of the system which have a dominant effect on the transient response during the time interval of interest."
"A new frequency-domain stability criterion employing a Popov-type multiplier is obtained for a class of nonlinear sampled-data control systems containing a monotonically nondecreasing nonlinearity. This criterion is an extension of previous results, in that unlike other criteria of this type, no upper bound is placed on the derivative of the nonlinearity. An example is given in which this new criterion is used to obtain stability conditions for a non-linear sampled-data system. These conditions are less restrictive than those obtained using other stability criteria."
"A new method for optimal control of nonlinear systems with input constraint is discussed in this paper. The system is optimized by minimizing a quadratic performance index. Considering this problem as a nonlinear programming problem, the necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal control are derived, which are later simplified to an integral equation. This integral equation becomes a necessary condition. The existence of a solution of this integral equation is studied, and a method of solving it is discussed. A numerical example is worked out at the end."
"The control of dist,ributed parameter (DP) systems represents a real challenge, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view, to the systems engineer. Distribut.ed parameter systems arise in various application areas, such as chemical proms systems, aerospace systems, magneto-hydrodynamic systems, and communicat. ions systems, to ment.ion just a few. Thus, there is sufficient motivation for research directed t,oward the analysis, synt.hesis, and design techniques for DP systems. On t.he surface, it. may appear that t.he available theory for distributed parameter systems is almost at the same level as that associated with lumped systems. However, there exists a much wider gap between the theory and its applications. In the remainder of this correspondence, we shall briefly discus the reasons for this gap and suggest, certain tentative approaches which may contribute to the development of a theory and computat,ional algorithms which take into account. some of the practical problems associated with the design of controllers for DP systems. In order to make these concepts clear it. becomes necessary to briefly review, in an informal manner, what a DP system is and in what sense it differs, from both a mat,hemat.ical and a practical point of view, from a conventional lumped system."
"It is the purpose of this correspondence to show how filtering theory based on a Bayesian approach may be used to solve the problem of optimally controlling a linear discrete stochastic system in which the additive Gaussian plant noise has fixed but unknown variance.

From this theorem conditions are derived which allow one to verify whether a linear time-varying system admits a realization in which either the state matrixAand the state-input matrixB, or the state matrixAand the state-output matrixC, are constant."
"In this correspondence, we dualize the definition of controllable space introduced in [1], and exhibit the geometric structure of minimal-order dynamic observers of Luenberger's type [2]. For notational reasons we start with the control situation, then dualize results to obtain the observer."
"The purpose of this correspondence is to report some relations that can be used to extend the scope of a computational algorithm for the suboptimal design of linear regulator systems. This algorithm was presented in [1], and can be used to determine suboptimal piecewise constant feedback gains to be used instead of the optimal continuously time-varying ones [3]. This correspondence deals with the extension to the case where, in addition to the piecewise constant gains, the switching times are also optimized."
"Davison and Chidambara have exposed methods [1], [5] for approximating a linear dynamic system of high dimension by a model of lower dimension, neglecting the fast decaying modes associated with eigenvalues of high magnitude. In spite of a number of correspondence items from the authors it is not clear which model should be used since the examples given might as well show that either method is correct or incorrect according to the cases. In fact it will appear in the following that the problem lies in the existence of null eigenvalues and that a modification of Davison's model in that case will solve the problem, at least for step inputs; for general inputs it will also be clear that some care must be taken, which was not evident in the previous papers."
"The purpose of this correspondence is to explain the surprisingly simple feedback laws derived by Debs and Athans in their paper, and to indicate a broader class of systems that can be solved by this approach."
"A Kalman filter requires an exact knowledge of the process noise covariance matrixQand the measurement noise covariance matrixR. Here we consider the case in which the true values ofQandRare unknown. The system is assumed to be constant, and the random inputs are stationary. First, a correlation test is given which checks whether a particular Kalman filter is working optimally or not. If the filter is suboptimal, a technique is given to obtain asymptotically normal, unbiased, and consistent estimates ofQandR. This technique works only for the case in which the form ofQis known and the number of unknown elements inQis less thann \\times rwherenis the dimension of the state vector andris the dimension of the measurement vector. For other cases, the optimal steady-state gain Kopis obtained directly by an iterative procedure without identifyingQ. As a corollary, it is shown that the steady-state optimal Kalman filter gain Kopdepends only onn \\times rlinear functionals ofQ. The results are first derived for discrete systems. They are then extended to continuous systems. A numerical example is given to show the usefulness of the approach."
"A brief development of necessary conditions for an extremal path in the case where the system equations and the performance index contain a time delay in both the state and the control variables is given. An analytic solution is also presented for a linear system with a quadratic performance index in the case where the control variable appears in the system equations evaluated both at the present time and at a previous time. Unspecified constants in the solution are obtained by the inversion of a specified matrix. Results for some examples are illustrated."
 "It is shown that certain results on inverse systems derived recently by several authors [1]-[4] can also be obtained as a special case of the optimum filtering and smoothing results of Bryson et al. [5]-[8]."
"For a stable linear system with a random input, expressions are derived for open- and closed-loop trajectory sensitivity. A condition is derived under which a closed-loop system is superior to the open-loop system."
"This correspondence deals with the controllability of the sensitivity system associated to a given linear discrete system. It is proved that, apart from exceptional cases, the sensitivity system is always uncontrollable provided that the number of the parameters is sufficiently large. The results presented here have a structural nature since they involve only the dimensions of the state, control, and parameter vectors."
"The pursuit-evasion differential games considered in this paper involve two linear dynamical systems containing both the state-dependent and the control-dependent noises. The quadratic form of the \"miss\" and the time-average control energies are used as the performance index. The optimal strategy is shown to be linear in the state vectors of the two systems."
"A method is developed for the numerical approximation of the Laplace transform of a function of time. The Legendre-Gauss quadrature formula is used to derive a multiple interval sampling technique which is an improvement over the previously published technique. An example is included for comparison with the previous technique."
"This correspondence points out the inadequacy of the discrete describing function method in predicting certain modes of oscillations in a class of relay sampled-data systems. These modes, however, do not exist in this class of systems. This must be ascertained before the previously mentioned method could be applied to determine all the possible modes of a system. Furthermore, the necessary change in critical regions is suggested for this class of systems to predict the correct mode of oscillation."
"In this correspondence, feasibility of generation of rational Lyapunov functions (LF) from any given Lyapunov function, and any RL, RC, or LC immittance function is shown. Extensions of these general results are made. Some methods of generating transcendental Lyapunov functions are also mentioned."
"In a previous correspondence, stabilization of relay-type discrete systems using high-frequency sinusoidal dither, by the method of a dual input discrete describing function was discussed. The dual input discrete describing function reduces to the ordinary describing function of a saturating amplifier and a relay with dead zone when triangular and square wave stabilizing signals are used."
"Using Bucy's representation theorem for conditional density functions, a finite-dimensional solution for a system identification problem is derived. The derivation displays how, for this nonlinear estimation problem, the function-space representation for the posterior density can be greatly simplified."
"An on-line performance measure for adaptive Kalman estimators is derived which is shown to be an optimal mean-square estimate of actual system performance. The proposed measure utilizes quantities readily available from the adaptive estimator, and hence a minimum of additional computational effort is required for its evaluation."
 "An alternate derivation of the feedback gains in explicit form for the single equivalent input modal control technique described by Simon and Mitter [3] is presented here. This derivation has the important advantage of being able to handle repeated eigenvalues of the open-loop system."
"A servosystem containing a relay with dead zone and hysteresis is considered. A new frequency-domain stability criterion is given by taking into account the particular characteristics of the nonlinearity, and it is shown that if the linear subsystem in the feedback loop contains a free integrator and its frequency response satisfies this criterion, then the error settles within the dead zone after a finite time."
"A frequency-response design technique is presented for multirate digital controllers that does not require the system to be low pass with respect to the slow-rate sampling frequency."
 "This correspondence extends two algorithms for unconstrained minimization in Rn, Davidon's method and a projected gradient algorithm, to optimal control problems. Both require only the value and gradient of the functional being minimized; both find the current search direction by operating on the negative gradient with a dyadic operator; and both generate conjugate directions when applied to a quadratic functional. To compute the direction of search at iterationi, the Davidon algorithm requires that2i + 2functions, generated in past and current cycles, be stored. The projected gradient method requires onlyi + 2. Both decrease the value of the functional being minimized at each step. The storage demands will require that both methods be restarted periodically. However, recent computational results indicate that this may improve the rate of convergence."
"This correspondence considers a system with a linear time-invariant part and a nonlinearity or time-varying gain in a feedback loop, and obtains conditions for the exponential boundedness of the signals, utilizing the passive operator technique. It turns out that the transfer function of the linear part shifted in argument has to satisfy the same conditions as for stability in order to ensure exponential boundedness."

"Analytical expressions have been obtained by Mendel [1] for performance cost functions that describe the behavior of a reaction-jet-controlled system during an on-off limit cycle. The cost functions are expressed in terms of the amplitudes of the limit-cycle switch states\\theta_{s}and\\dot{\\theta}_{s}. No structure is assumed foru(t)in [1]. In this paper,u(t)is chosen to be an asymmetrical deadzone function that is proceeded by aT-second time delay. Contained withinu(t)are three design variables: control gainsK_{\\theta}andK_\\dot{\\theta}, and asymmetryl. This paper shows how\\theta_{s}and\\dot{\\theta}_{s}can be obtained from prespecified values ofK_{\\theta}andK_{\\dot{\\theta}}, and howK_{\\theta}andK_{\\dot{\\theta}}can be obtained from prespecified values of\\theta_{s}and\\dot{\\theta}_{s}; thus, it provides one with the means for utilizing the results in [1] for a specified controller. In addition, conditions are obtained for the existence of an on-off limit cycle. These conditions are interpreted in the phase plane; that is to say, each condition is viewed as a phase-plane constraint or constraints between\\theta_{s}and\\dot{\\theta}_{s}. It is shown how to construct the admissible regions for\\theta_{s}and\\dot{\\theta}_{s}ahead of time. It is also shown how to choose the asymmetry variablelso that limit-cycle existence is assured. All of the results are brought together first as a synthesis procedure, and then as an analysis procedure. Details of both procedures are given. This paper provides the control system designer with new tools for: 1) better understanding the limitations of a fixed controller for the reaction-jet-controlled vehicle; 2) more efficient ways to analyze choices of the controller's parameters on system performance; and 3) more efficient ways to choose these parameters."
"Sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability in the large of pulse-modulated feedback systems are developed from the operator theoretic viewpoint. Stability here requires that the pulse-modulated feedback system be a Lipschitz continuous operator on the extended spaceL_{1e}. This strong definition of stability is motivated by an examination of a first-order pulsewidth-modulated system. To provide a unified format for the main development two distinct general classes of pulse modulators are defined. Type I includes the pulsewidth modulator and more general pulsewidth frequency modulators that contain a sampler. Type II includes, for example, the integral pulse frequency modulator and its generalizations. For elements of Type I conditions are derived to bound the incremental gain (onL_{1e}) of the modulator in cascade with a linear element; a standard transformation of the feedback loop similar to that used in the derivation of the Popov criterion yields sufficient conditions for stability of the feedback system in the above strong sense. Type II modulators are discontinuous on any normed linear space and thus, only conditions for boundedness of the closed-loop system as an operator on L1are given for this case."
"A novel system is discussed for measuring the auto-correlationR(\\tau)of a random process. The system consists of a scaling device and a filter whose output equalsR(bt). Thus,R(\\tau)is determined not by a succession of discrete values but as a continuous signal in real time. It is also shown that the instrument can be used to determine the impulse responsey(t)of a dynamic systemN. The unknown responsey(t)is exhibited as a continuous signal."
"Zero-sum differential games are considered in which one or both of the players are restricted to use open-loop control. It is shown that the first-order necessary conditions for such problems are identical to the first-order necessary conditions for the usual form of a differential game, where both players use closed-loop control laws. An investigation of the conjugate point condition for a special class of games shows that this condition is not the same but depends on the type of solution sought. For games where one or both of the players use open-loop control, there are two conjugate point conditions that must be satisfied. This differs from games in which both players use closed-loop control, where there is only one conjugate point necessary condition."
"The Nyquist stability criterion and the notion of typensystems have been extended from lumped parameter systems to a larger class of linear single-loop single-input single-output time-invariant systems, with constraints presented in the text."
"The concepts of specific optimal control, trajectory sensitivity design, and perfect model following are integrated to develop a general design technique for the linear servo model following problem. Control laws designed by this procedure are characterized by partial state feedback, perfect model following when theoretically possible, relative insensitivity of the compensated plant to mathematical modeling inaccuracies, and plant-model realignment in the presence of state disturbances. The feasibility of the design technique is demonstrated by the design of a nontrivial aircraft control problem."
"A method is given for choosing feedbacks from an output vector of smaller dimension than the state vector in such a way that a subset of the roots assume desired values. A sufficient condition for arbitrary placement of as many roots as there are feedbacks is proved. It is also proved that a root corresponding to a mode which is either uncontrollable or unobservable cannot be altered. It may be desired to place more roots than there are feedbacks, and it is shown that the method can be extended to give an approximate solution of this problem."
"Sequential estimation of the state of a linear continuous system from randomly sampled noisy measurements is considered. Reformulation of the original problem leads to an interesting correlation between plant and measurement noise, which requires a special sequential algorithm. Effects on estimation error variance by varying the ratio of the discrete sample period to the average of the random sample period are discussed. An example is given to illustrate the techniques presented."
"An easily implemented method for obtaining the reachable setR_{N}, N > n, of annth-order discrete system with constraints on the input is described. This method uses elementary matrix calculations at each step to construct the boundary hyperplanes of the reachable set. The result can be applied to determine the minimum control time required for a given terminal state. IfN \\leq n, the method of echelon matrix analysis is employed to solve the same problem."
"A model is developed for the subclass of pulse frequency modulation known as neural pulse frequency modulation (NPFM). It contains one nonlinear element with hysteresis and produces an output waveform which is a train of constant amplitude and constant area pulses with exponentially decaying trailing edges. This type of output waveform is a better representation of neural signals than those produced by models previously reported. A further advantage of this model is that it satisfies a less restrictive condition of the generalized Popov theorem when it is used for the stability analysis of a class of closed-loop systems containing an NPF modulator."
"The following system is considered:\\dot{x}= Ax + Buy = Cxwherexis annvector describing the state of the system,uis anmvector of inputs to the system, andyis anlvector (l \\leq n) of output variables. It is shown that if rankC = l, and if (A,B) are controllable, then a linear feedback of the output variables u = K*y, where K*is a constant matrix, can always be found, so thatleigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix A + BK*C are arbitrarily close (but not necessarily equal) tolpreassigned values. (The preassigned values must be chosen so that any complex numbers appearing do so in complex conjugate pairs.) This generalizes an earlier result of Wonham [1]. An algorithm is described which enables K*to be simply found, and examples of the algorithm applied to some simple systems are included."
"A second-variation approach to the minimal fuel problem is presented. The gradient and Hessian of the norm of the terminal error with respect to the final conditions of the costate equation are formed. The discontinuities induced by the assumed form of the control are treated using the theory of distributions."
"Learning heuristics for an on-line controller are presented, and various aspects of the problem are discussed. The controller is required to achieve optimal regulator control for an unknown process in the face of random disturbances. A computer method of two-stage learning is employed in which the first stage is coarse and attempts to satisfy the terminal boundary conditions on the basis of subgoal learning. This yields an approximation to the optimum control law. Rote learning is also carried out during this time. The second, or tuning stage, improves on this result by a technique of reinforcement learning applied to the integral performance criterion. The effect of varying the parameters associated with the learning algorithm is studied. A discussion of a hybrid computer simulation of a second-order plant subject to one input with two possible levels is presented."
"A second-variation descent search is proposed for computing time-optimal control functions for linear time-invariant plants. Since the piecewise constant structure of the optimal control function parameterizes the relevant two-point boundary value problem, the terms required in the variational analysis are simply first and second partial derivatives of an appropriate scalar cost function with respect to the parameters. Closed form expressions for these derivatives can be obtained. As a result, the second-order terms are incorporated into the analysis with only a modest increase in computational effort over that required for the first-variation methods appearing in the literature [1]-[4]. The usual second-variation algorithm can be applied only if the matrix of second derivatives is positive definite at each iteration. Since this condition generally fails to hold during the early stages of the search, a modified version of the algorithm is developed, based on the selection of a positive definite model for the matrix of second derivatives. Performance of the modified algorithm is shown to be significantly better than that of the familiar Newton algorithm in regions of parameter space far from the solution point. Particularly striking results are obtained when all the eigenvalues of the plant are real."
"Steady-state reaction control of the attitude of a spacecraft in the presence of environmental disturbance torquesTis usually accomplished by using the thrusters to establish limit-cycle motion of acceptable amplitudes about all three axes. For such strategies, the greatest lower bound for the propellant consumption is proportional to\\int\\min{t1}\\max{t2}\\|T\\|dt. The results presented in this paper show that when the disturbances are not unidirectional, the environment, consisting of gravity-gradient and aerodynamic torques, can be used to reduce this lower bound significantly. The linearized equation which describes the dynamics of an inertially referenced satellite has a periodic coefficient matrix and forcing vector. The existence of forced periodic solutions of such equations is established, and an algorithm for determining an initial point on the trajectory of these solutions in state space is provided. This defines a \"natural\" limit cycle, i.e., both turning points of this motion are produced by the environment. In particular, the periodic rotational motion about two of the spacecraft axes is produced by the aerodynamic torque, an effect which is usually neglected."
"A simple extension of the energy metric algorithm is presented which modifies the system equation so that the resultant form of the Lyapunov function generates the Routh-Hurwitz conditions for the reduced linear system. A third-order example is included."
"The exact method of calculating the amplitude of the dither signal from the dual input discrete describing function (DIDDF) portrait is pointed out. It is shown that a previously established relationship between φ and the system under consideration considerably simplifies its application. Further, it is established that only half the range of φ need be considered for a particular period of oscillation. Thus the utility of the DIDDF is considerably enhanced."
"In this paper, it is established that a necessary and sufficient condition for two monic polynomialsf(\\lambda)andg(\\lambda)to have a common root is that\\det [f(B)] = 0or\\det [g(A)] = 0, whereAandBare, respectively, the companion matrices associated withf(\\lambda)andg(\\lambda). The simplicity of this method is illustrated by examples."
"An approach is described for the study of the transient performance of a class of second-order limit-cycling control systems. The geometrical features of the problem are used to derive expressions relating the limit-cycle dimensions with the excess overshoot. An example of application is studied using this approach."
"Some comments on the low-order sensitivity model proposed by Wilkie and Perkins are presented. The structural controllability of this model and the analysis of its observability properties allow one to conclude that the model is optimum in the sense that no lower order sensitivity model exists that can generate all the state sensitivity functions for the class of systems for which the theory developed in Wilkie and Perkins holds."
"The problem of minimizing the cost functional corresponding to minimum control energyI = \\int\\min{0}\\max{\\infty}u^{2} dtfor the linear system with delay\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bx(t - h) + cu(t)is considered. From sufficient conditions for optimality, one obtains a set of algebraic equations. Numerical solution of these equations yields the optimal control law."
"This paper is concerned with the behavior near the terminal time of a fixed time fixed end point linear time-varying control problem with a quadratic performance index. In a previous paper [3], the asymptotic behavior of the gain matrix near the terminal time was found. These results are used now to obtain a constructive method for finding a convergent Laurent expansion of the gain matrix in some neighborhood of the terminal time."

It is shown that the revised system is more effective than the previously proposed system, especially with regard to passenger comfort because it takes into account jerk, the rate of change of acceleration and deceleration."
"A method is presented for finding closed-form solutions for a class of linear time-varying systems. The method results from performing a time-varying linear transformation on the original system and adjoining a differential equation constraint. A set of underdetermined auxiliary equations (i.e., more unknowns than equations) must be solved. An example is given to show the usefulness of the method."

 "The iterative procedure for the state estimation of a nonlinear discrete process is presented. The proposed method is proved to give the optimal estimate of the least-mean-square error criterion after infinite iteration for a class of optimal estimates. The calculation formula for the quadratic nonlinear process is presented to illustrate the procedure. In the formula, the coefficient of the iteration is calculated by assuming the estimation error is Gaussian. This assumption is found not to affect the convergence as long as the error caused by the assumption is less than 100 percent. The application to the identification is given, and it leads to satisfactory results."
"The preceding correspondence [1] gives a technique for correcting the feedback control coefficients with each change (in the mean of the model) provided by concurrent system identification. The new result here is a similar technique that incorporates changes in both the mean and covariance of the system model."

"A recent publication [1] proposes a solution requiring complete recalculation of a sequence of matrices (backward from the end of the interval) with each model change provided by the concurrent real-time system identification. The new result here is a control algorithm which incorporates the identification with a computationally simpler forward-calculation correction technique."
"A method of designing linear regulators with incomplete state feedback has been suggested by Rekasius [1]. Ramar and Ramaswami [2] have pointed out the difficulties encountered in applying this method. This correspondence presents, briefly, an alternative approach to this problem in two cases of a) unknown initial state and b) known initial state statistics, viz., mean and covariance matrix. Solution for the control law utilizing only the available states is obtained by minimizing an upper bound on the ratio of the suboptimal to optimal cost in case a). In case b) the expected value of the suboptimal cost is minimized. It is assumed that the available states are sufficient to make the feedback system stable. The solution is in the form of necessary conditions and results in a set of simultaneous polynomial equations, but the solution to the optimal control problem is not required."
"In this correspondence a new method is described for determining the impulse-response of an approximately linear system using the cross-correlation function between an input pseudorandom binary signal and the corresponding output signal of the system under study. A filter matched to a periodic pseudo-random binary signal is used to obtain the needed correlation function."

"Abstract-The effects of random variations of the plant parameters in multivariable linear control systems are analyzed in terms of stochastic sensitivity operators. Both tie-varying and time-invariant control systems are analyzed. Conditions are derived for the stochastic sensitivity operator which are sufficient to guarantee that the closed-loop realization of the control system is less sensitive to the random parameter variations than the nominally equivalent open-loop system."
"dbstmcf-In a high-performance aircraft, c h a n g e s i n M a c h number, angle of attack, and altitude can cause a large variation i n t h e short-period transfer function. To provide the pilot with a constant pitch rate control characteristic, an airborne computer with inputs of elevator deflection angle and pitch rate is used to identify and track changes in the elevator effectiveness. Empirical equations are defined to approximate the aircraft time constant, damping factor, and natural frequency as functions of elevator effectiveness in three difference equations, which are iterated to model the aircraft. Parameters in the difference equations are systematically perturbed until the equation, which uses a value of elevator effectiveness intermediate between the values in the other two equations, also has the smallest mean-square error from the actual aircraft response. The value of elevator effectiveness in this intermediate equation is then presumed to be the same as that of the aircraft and is used to set the loop gain to a pre-determined suitable value. Simulation with an aircraft whose elevator effectiveness varied over a range of 240: 1 showed that the desired loop gain was maintained within a factor of two for both pilot command inputs and for random wind gust disturbances of a root-mean-square magnitude of 20 ftjs."

The results achieved represent significant reduction of the computations compared to other existing methods."
"Jump resonance is a particular type of discontinuity, the absence of which may be predicted by using one form of the circle criterion. Another method of determining presence or absence of jump resonance is due to Fukuma and Matsubara [1]. These two methods are compared after rederiving the Fukuma-Matsubara criterion using different bounds on the nonlinearity. The Fukuma-Matsubara criterion is found to yield a critical region inside the critical circle. Furthermore, an example is given in which the Fukuma-Matsubara criterion predicts the gain needed to produce jump resonance."

"Two basic methods for designing feedback compensators which may be used to achieve arbitrary closed-loop pole positions are now available. This correspondence shows that when each method is used within the framework of optimal control the same compensator structure results, but the more standard approach using a state estimator and a linear law appears to be the more attractive from the information now available."

"An algorithm for constructing minimal linear finite-dimensional realizations (a minimal partial realization) of an unknown (possibly infinite-dimensional) system from an external description as given by its Markov parameters is presented. It is shown that the resulting realization in essence models the transient response of the unknown system. If the unknown system is linear, this technique can be used to find a smaller dimensional linear system having the same transient characteristics. If the unknown system is nonlinear, the technique can be used either 1) to determine a useful nonlinear model, or 2) te determine a linear model, both of which approximate the transient response of the nonlinear system."

"Algorithms are developed for the error analysis of the optimal filtering solution for colored noise. The types of error sources considered are those both in the imprecise specification of the model and in the improper choice of the noise statistics. The matrix differential equations have been derived permitting the calculation of the actual error covariance and the additional error due to the preceding error sources. For a case where only the error source based on the incorrect choice of the noise statistics is present, a conservative design criterion has also been established, which makes it possible to prescribe the performance of the filter for colored noise. A simple example demonstrates the utility of these results."

"The problem of realizing a near ideal predictor for use in compensation of error sampled linear systems is considered and a solution using fast-time simulation is proposed. Prediction theory is extended to include the near ideal predictor and analytical results are presented. A comparison is made between ideal and near ideal prediction as applied to the compensation of example systems. Near ideal predictive compensation is compared with conventional compensation; their combination provides a new and versatile approach to compensation. Errors in the fast-time simulation model are considered, and it appears that the fundamental advantages of using near ideal predictive compensation are retained even when the model is inexact. The ability of this new technique to provide, in effect, a zero without a pole in thezplane offers unique advantages in the compensation of systems containing a time delay."

A brief review of the development of sensitivity coefficients and the governing sensitivity equation is given. The desensitization problem is then formulated as an optimal control problem with a specified feedback structure and performance indices defined for both the state and sensitivity vectors. A method of iteratively finding the optimal feedback gains by simultaneous solution of the state and sensitivity equations via analog computer is described and an algorithm is given. This method of analog sensitivity design is then applied to a seventh-order model of a Saturn V booster with the frequency of the first bending mode serving as the unknown parameter. Analog sensitivity design is shown to produce a control system with sensitivity to the varying parameter greatly reduced over that of the corresponding system designed without using sensitivity considerations."
"This paper generalizes and unifies the concepts developed by Kalman and Luenberger pertaining to the design of discrete linear systems which estimate the state of a linear plant on the basis of both noise-free and noisy measurements of the output variables.

 "The performance of the inertial-grade floated rate-integrating gyroscope is critically dependent on the instrument surface temperature distribution. During operation, the instrument is degraded by distributed surface heat-flux disturbances, and it is desired to control the surface temperature distribution in a closed-loop feedback configuration such that the instrument degradation is minimized. This is achieved via optimal control theory, where a distributed feedback controller is determined such that the square of thermally induced drift rate is minimized. The structure of the resulting controller is examined, and various configurations for implementation are suggested."
"A new technique is described for filtering a pseudorandom binary sequence to produce pseudorandom noise that has a near-Gaussian amplitude probability density function. Its principal advantages are that the half-power bandwidth of the noise is approximately eight times that obtained with existing techniques, and the desirable autocorrelation properties of the binary sequence are retained. A practical design for a noise generator using the new technique is described. The results of simulation are given to substantiate the advantages claimed."

"Equations for the optimal linear control and filter gains for linear discrete systems with quadratic performance criteria are widely documented. A nonrecursive algebraic solution for the Riccati equation is presented. These relations allow the determination of the steady-state solution of the Riccati equation directly without iteration. The relations also allow the direct determination of the transient solution for any particular time without proceeding recursively from the initial conditions. The method involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the canonical state-costate equations."

"The Riccati equation associated with a class of discrete-time correlated noise problems is examined, and the concept of invariant directions for this equation is introduced. For single-output systems the set of such directions is completely characterized. Deletion of these directions by an appropriate transformation of the Riccati equation results in a minimal order equation for computation. This transformation also reveals the underlying structure of the optimal filter for the correlated noise problem."
"This paper examines in detail the estimation errors of two algorithms proposed by Koopmans [1] and Levin [2] for identifying linear systems described by annth-order scalar difference equation.

A priori error bounds on estimation error are obtained to provide a quantitative basis for comparing these algorithms in relation to the maximum likelihood estimates. Computational results are also presented to supplement the theoretical discussions."
"A method is presented for designing controllers for linear time-invariant systems whose states are not all available or accessible for measurement and where the structure of the controller is constrained to be a linear time-invariant combination of the measurable states of the system. Two types of structure constraints are considered: 1) each control channel is constrained to be a linear, time-invariant combination of one set of measurable states; 2) each control channel is constrained to he a linear, time-invariant combination of different sets of measurable states. The control system, subject to these constraints is selected such that the resulting closed-loop system performs as \"near\" to some known optimal system as is possible, i.e., suboptimal. The nearness of the optimal system to the suboptimal system is defined in two ways and thus, two types of suboptimal controllers are found."
"By introducing into a constant linear system (F, G, H) with input vectoruand output vectoryan open-loop controlu = Pvand observerz = Qy, a new constant linear system (F, GP, QH) results which has input vector\\upsilonand output vectorz. The problem investigated is one of constructing (F, GP, QH) so that\\upsilonandzhave minimal dimension, subject to the condition that the controllability and observability properties of (F, G, H) are preserved. It is shown that when the scalar fieldF(over which the system is defined) is infinite, the minimal dimensions of\\upsilonandzare essentially independent of the specific values of the input and output matricesGandH. It is also shown that this is not the case whenFis finite. Furthermore, an algorithm is presented for the construction of the minimal input (minimal output) (F, GP, QH), which is directly represented in a useful canonical form."
"An important class of optimal control problems, arising frequeutly in an economic framework, is characterized as having a cost functional that is continuous but has discontinuous partial derivatives with respect to the state variables. Such problems are said to have kinks. Along a kink the classical adjoint equation breaks down, and it is impossible to define a gradient. In this paper it is shown that the gradient can be replaced by a more general definition of the direction of steepest descent but that the adjoint equation must in general be replaced by an adjoint optimal control problem. This yields a complete set of necessary conditions for problems of this type. The results derived are then combined with the theory of penalty functions to convert a problem having state constraints to one without such constraints."
"In structuring tactics for evading a pursuing vehicleP, it is often the case that the evaderEdoes not know the intercept time.E's policy must by necessity be random, the precise definition being dependent upon the dynamic description of the vehicles and the geometry of the engagement. A method of designing efficient evasion tactics that apportions available maneuver effort over a time interval so as to make the expected pursuer miss distance independent of intercept time is presented. The evasion maneuvers are also structured so thatEreaches the confines of some defended region, his ultimate goal."

A scalar example illustrates the utilization of the algorithm."
"The problem of estimating the autoregressive parameters of a mixed autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) time series (of known order) using the output data alone is treated. This problem is equivalent to the estimation of the denominator terms of the scalar transfer function of a stationary, linear discrete time system excited by an unobserved unenrrelated sequence input by employing only the observations of the scalar output. The solution of this problem solves the problem of the identification of the dynamics of a white-noise excited continuous-time linear stationary system using sampled data. The latter problem was suggested by Bartlett in 1946. The problem treated here has appeared before in the engineering literature. The earlier treatment yielded biased parameter estimates. An asymptotically unbiased estimator of the autoregressive parameters is obtained as the solution of a modified set of Yule-Walker equations. The asymptotic estimator covariance matrix behaves like a least-squares parameter estimate of an observation set with unknown error covariances. The estimators are also shown to be unbiased in the presence of additive independent observation noise of arbitrary finite correlation time. An example illustrates the performance of the estimating procedures."
"Comparison between open- and closed-loop implementations have been made by Youla and Dorato [1] and Kriendler [2], etc., but the implementation with two degrees of freedom does not appear to have been considered. An attempt to reveal the potentiality of the implementation with two degrees of freedom in applying the configuration to reduce various sensitivities of an optimal system due to plant parameter variations is presented."

Necessary and sufficient conditions for complete controllability of such sampled-data systems in terms ofTandf(t)are given. This is a generalization of a well-known theorem for the special casef(t) \\equiv 1due to Kalman et al. The results may prove to be important if for practical reasons the shaping functionf(t) \\equiv 1cannot be realized."

"A nonparametric stochastic approximation type of algorithm for on-line identification is considered. By on-line, it is meant that the system is driven by an arbitrary, known input, the control, in addition to an input noise disturbance. Thus, the control effort proceeds in conjunction with identification and is in no way restricted by the requirements of identification. The system is assumed to be all-pole with unknown poles, unknown gain, and noiseless output measurement. Consequently, the procedure is useful when the degree of inaccuracy in the knowledge of the system is much larger than possible output measurement errors. Adaptive control using this procedure is discussed, together with a numerical example."
"A method for the determination of boundary lines that enclose the root contours of control systems is presented. The boundary lines divide thesplane into realizability regions within which the complex conjugate roots of the system characteristic equation must lie. The method is valid for positive and negative real values of two variable system parameters. Furthermore, the implementation of this method does not require the need for the tedious construction of individual root loci as is usually the case. Examples of the determination of realizability regions of a multivariable and multiloop feedback control systems are presented."
"A second-order nonlinear model of steel refining in an electric are furnace is formulated and optimized. Iterative computation using steepest descent shows the existence of an optimal singular arc, which is then found more precisely by directly applying necessary conditions for such an arc.

The dependence of the singular arc on problem parameters is explored."

 "The design of linear time-invariant dynamic compensators of fixed dimensionalitys, which are to be used for the regulation of annth-order linear time-invariant plant, is dealt with. A modified quadratic cost criterion is employed in which a quadratic penalty on the system state as well as all compensator gains is used; the effects of the initial state are averaged out. The optimal compensator gains are specified by a set of simultaneous nonlinear matrix algebraic equations. The numerical solution of these equations would specify the gain matrices of the dynamic compensator. The proposed method may prove useful in the design of low-orderscompensators for high-ordernplants that have fewroutputs, so that the dimension of the compensator is less than that obtained through the use of the associated Kalman-Bucy filternor the Luenberger observern - r."
"For feedback equations of the forme = x - He, in whichHis a linear operator, stability boundaries obtained by the circle criterion method can frequently be improved by finding a functionf(H)which conformally maps the spectrum ofHfrom its initial region in the complex plane into a more suitable region. This idea, which is based on the spectral mapping theorem of Banach algebras, is applied here to a class of equations consisting of a time-invariant part and a periodically time-varying gain. A stability bound is derived which has a minimum whenever the frequency response of the time-invariant part peaks at a frequency near one half that of the time-varying gain."

These missiles contain target trackers which provide angular information about the relative interceptor-to-target geometry. The performance criterion for this problem is quadratic, but the system equations are nonlinear. Suitable guidance mechanizations are obtained by applying the technique of quasi-optimum control. The efficiency of the resulting guidance system, relative to a linear optimum guidance system and a proportional navigation system, is demonstrated by simulations of attack situations in which the interceptor missile launch conditions depart from the nominal attack geometry."

An invariant set theorem for random systems [2] is used to prove convergence (in probability) of the identification algorithm proposed in [1]. Indeed, in view of the power of the deterministic invariant set theorem, it is of great interest to study methods of useful application of the stochastic analogy. One of the main contributions is the illustration of its potential power, via the vehicle of the identification problem."

"Lumped elements have found increasing use in microwave integrated circuits at low UHF and S-band frequencies. At this laboratory they have been used in various circuits such as filters, quadrature hybrids, and impedance matching networks for high-power transistor amplifiers. Limiting the use of lumped elements has been: (1) the uncertainties of the reactance and Q's of the elements at frequencies above 2.5 GHz, and (2) the difficulty of fabricating the high-Q components necessary for large impedance transformations to low-impedance active devices. The past difficulty in measuring the reactance and Q values above S-band has been the unavailability of a measurement system at high frequencies that is compatible with the size of the element. However, suitable resonant techniques have now been developed for frequencies from 1 to 12 GHZ. Lumped inductors and capacitors fabricated at this Iaboratory have been measured by these new techniques. The results demonstrate that high-Q capacitors have been achieved by recent improvements in thin-film dielectric processing, and that capacitors and single-turn inductors are \"truly lumped\" through 10 GHz."
"The dialectric resonator is the electromagnetic dual of the metal cavity resonator and has the advantage that miniaturization is achieved by dielectric loading without the corresponding reduction of Q, characteristic of metal cavities and transmission line resonators. This makes them an ideal candidate, when less temperature sensitive materials become available, to fill the need for a low cost, integratable, high Q, metal cavity replacement for microwave integrated circuit (MIC) applications. Considerable investigation of dielectric resonators has been done in waveguide structures. This paper presents design and fabrication techniques for incorporating them into MICs. External and mutual coupling coefficients are determined for C-Band rutile resonators mounted on MIC circuits and coupled to MIC microstrip lines. The effect of packaging on spurious transmission is shown. The performance of a C-Band multipole rutile resonator MIC bandpass filter is described. A simple tuning technique is also demonstrated."
"Dielectric resonators may be used as hybrid circuit elements in microstrip transmission line circuits. These resonators may function as bandpass filters, bandstop filters, passive stabilization cavities for solid-state diode oscillators, or as reference cavities for Pound discriminators. Dielectric resonators are small size and high Q which makes them desirable for microstrip circuits where deposited resonators are large at lower microwave frequencies and have limited Q's. The purpose of this paper is to present a simple design procedure for cylindrical TiO/sub 2/ resonators on microstrip and to illustrate the use of such a resonator in a practical Pound discriminator circuit."
"The increased use of microstrip transmission line for miniaturized printed microwave circuits has created a demand for a compact filter structure compatible with microstrip. The parallel coupled filter circuits developed by Cohn are very compact, but his design procedure does not apply to microstrip which has different even and odd mode velocities. This paper develops the theoretical analysis to compensate Cohn's procedure for even and odd mode velocity differences and develops design curves which permit the determination of the circuit geometry from the parameter K/Z/sub o/. The results only apply to filters with 50 /spl Omega/ impedance on 99.5% alumina substrates, but they can easily be generalized to other impedances."
"Typically loosely coupled backward wave microstrip couplers have directivities which decrease with increasing frequency. High directivity becomes more difficult to obtain as the coupling is loosened. The problem appears to be that the propagating velocities of the odd and even modes are not equal. This paper deals with a technique which equalizes these velocities up to an arbitrarily high frequency."

"The electromagnetic scattering from dielectric steps in waveguides is investigated using a new method based upon an extension of the modified residue calculus techniques. The major advantages of the method are its numerical efficiency and accuracy and that these characteristics are sustained at high frequencies as well as high permittivities."
"The ray optical technique has proved its computational advantages in high frequency scattering by objects in unbounded media and has only been recently applied to waveguide problems. Besides its simplicity, the method is surprisingly accurate in the short wavelength range and gives a physical insight into various complex propagation and diffraction mechanisms, Yee, Felsen and Keller used this technique to treat the reflection from an open-ended parallel plate waveguide. Later, Yee and Felsen solved the corresponding vector case for rectangular and circular waveguides. The agreement between theory and experiment was naturally better for shorter wavelengths. Yee and Felsen also treated waveguide discontinuities such as strips and bifurcation using the same technique. An excellent agreement wit:h the exact solutions, whenever possible, was noted in the multimode range with less accuracy in the range of propagation of the dominant mode and inaccurate results in the vicinity of the modal cut-offs. In order to improve the accuracy of the technique, a more accurate \"near field\" diffraction coefficient is necessary."
"Numerical calculation based on point-matching of electromagnetic fields can give accurate results, but the validity of the method depends on a basic formulation involving a complete expansion set for the fields. The validity of the so-called \"Rayleigh Hypothesis\", which attempts to avoid this issue by an analytic continuation of expressions for the fields, is questioned."
"Design details are presented for an open waveguide RADAR transmission line. This 94 GHz quasi-optical guide is presently in use at The Aerospace Corporation Laboratories, with two focusing mirrors and offset reeds providing power transfer and rotary joint action for a scanning 15' diameter parabolic antenna.

"With the advent of microwave integrated circuits many circuits which have been discarded in the early days of microwave theory and techniques are finding new applications. The bridged-T has been used for years in low frequency applications as attenuators. It actually is a much more general network and possesses some features which have not been utilized. Figure 1 shows a typical bridged T with a generator and load at Z/sub o/."
"In May 1968, a new active filter technique was reported to be suitable for UHF and microwave applications. A previously unexploited transistor mechanism, associated with the transit time properties of a transistor, is found to yield stable inductance with extremely high Q, or even negative Q; thus allowing a single transistor to be substituted for an inductor in conventional filter designs. Alternately, one transistor can be coupled to each filter resonator to raise its Q. As a result, microwave active filters can be made extremely small without insertion loss or selectivity degradation. For example, the volume per resonator of recent UHF filter designs is approximately 0.1 cubic inches. Subminiature active filters have been tested at frequencies ranging from low-VHF to S-band. Accomplishing a significant reduction in filter size makes possible a number of useful systems, such as lossless multiplexer with large numbers of contiguous filter channels. The ability to divide a frequency band into a large manifold of adjacent channels is a useful aid in the accurate processing of broad-bandwidth signals. The purpose of this paper is to present recent development in active filter designs with remarkably improved filter performance, and to discuss the application of active filter techniques to microwave frequency multiplexing."
"A type of elliptic-function filter is described that is easy to design and construct, has low passband loss, and is very compact. With simple scaling, a broad range of cutoff frequencies can be obtained with a limited number of standard parts. Experimental results are presented for three filters with cutoff frequencies of 0.75, 1.0, and 1.5 GHz. Each filter occupies a volume of about 0.5 in/sup3/."
"The theory and applications of Chebyshev functions are familiar in microwaves, circuit theory, and other fields. Less well known are the extensions of Chebyshev's theory by his student E. Zolotarev, whose work was described in detail and extended by Achieser. Some of these results have been found useful in the solution of certain problems in both distributed and mixed lumped/distributed component design. As originally presented, Zolotarev functions involve higher-order elliptic functions and require a good deal of interpretation and simplification, which has now been carried out. Several new results have been obtained, and the application to microwave component design, indeed possibly to any field of engineering, is probably novel."
"A new calculation technique is presented to minimize roundoff errors that occur in network synthesis of microwave TEM components. Both approximation and synthesis are accommodated in the complex W-plane, transformed from Richards' S = tanh /spl pi/s / 2/spl omega//sub o/ plane. The new technique has been applied to non-redundant bands top filters, to interdigital bandpass filters, and to diplexing filters. Results of calculations indicate that filters and other TEM components having two to three times as many elements can be synthesized in the W-plane as compared to similar calculations performed in the S-plane. The new method is particularly useful in the synthesis of complementary or pseudo-complementary diplexers."
"Techniques for the design and construction of compact multiplexing filters with minimum complexity, size, and loss are presented. The practicality and limitations of several types of filter forms at high microwave frequencies are demonstrated. Experimental results for four compact multiplexing networks covering L-band through K/sub U/-band are given."

"This paper describes a Ku-band nondegenerate parametric amplifier, using a new type of idler choke and a simple resonator, that exibits a nearly flat bandwidth of 550 MHz at 20 dB gain and a noise temperature of 280 /spl deg/K at room temperature ambient."
"System design of satellite communications utilizing millimeter wavelength is being studied. It is most probable that the down link frequency will be between 15 and 20 GHz. That system will require wideband, low noise (around 100 /spl deg/K) amplifiers at the earth stations. Only cooled nondegenerate parametric amplifiers are able to meet requirements. But bandwidths and noise temperatures of those amplifiers already reported on in this band were several tens of MHz and several hundred degrees Kelvin, respectively. This paper describes design and performance of a cryogenically cooled, wideband (600 MHz), low noise (100 /spl deg/K) nondegenerate parametric amplifier."
"In the past parametric amplification was limited to microwave frequencies, as varactors did not reach high enough cutoff frequencies and low enough parasitic reactance. Recently Au-GsAs Schottky Barrier junctions with cutoff frequencies f/sub c/ beyond 1000 GHz mounted in Sharpless-wafers have opened the mm-wave region for this device."
"Solid-state magnetoplasma devices have been recently proposed as phase-shifters, isolators, filters, and circulators for use at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. We herewith report observations of phenomena indicating that magnetoplasmas can also be utilized to efficiently transduce millimeter and submillimeter energy from one waveguide mode to another present microwave devices which accomplish this function are mechanical in nature and are thus subject to wavelength limitations imposed by dimensional tolerances. Besides circumventing such limitations, magnetoplasma mode-conversion devices have the additional advantage of being magnetically controllable. In the present paper, we consider one-port conversion from the circular TE/spl circle /sub01/ mode to the circular TM/spl circle over sub 01/ mode. The basic principle is, however, also applicable to two-port conversion and to several other choices of waveguide geometry and mode-pair."
"The object of this paper is to show that a switch using PIN diodes is especially well suited for mm-wave high speed digital modulation. The PIN diodes to be described have a switching speed of less than 0.7 nsec and a power handling capability in excess of 200 mW. The quoted switching speed is realized with a transistorized driver consuming 0.8W. The switching quality factor Q of the PIN diodes is approximately 40 at 55 GHz-including the loss in the diode mount."

"There is still a widely held view that the modern, high-speed, large storage digital computer is most effectively utilized as a tool for analysis, and that most, if not alI, decisions (even routine decisions) relating to optimal design are best left to the engineer himself. One reason for this view may arise out of the engineer's apprehension of a machine taking over the decision making process altogether. An alternative one may be that his system is so complex that even one analysis requires considerable effort. On a more mundane level, it may be that the engineer is so imbued by manual cut-and-try techniques as used in the laboratory under his control that he cannot envisage the possibility of fully automated design. Even the classicist must ultimately substitute numbers into his \"exact\" or \"closed-form\" solutions. It is probably some combination of such reasons that is inspiring the proliferation of effort devoted to the writing and implementing of general purpose circuit analysis programs."
"In recent contributions, Director and Rohrer discussed the concept of the adjoint network and its relevance to automated design of networks in the frequency and time domains. Employing Tellegen's theorem they demonstrated how the gradient vector for a least squares type of response objective function with respect to all existing (and nonexisting, if desired) elements could be evaluated from only two complete analyses, one of the given network and one of its topologicalIy equivalent adjoint network. In the frequency domain they considered both reciprocal and nonreciprocal lumped, linear and time invariant elements. More recently, it was shown how their approach could be implemented for least pth and minimax response objective functions."
"A great deal of work has been published on the design of broadband matching networks between fixed dissimilar impedances. Quarter-wave transformers and lumped-element low-pass filters have been analyzed thoroughly."

"Despite the widespread use of dielectric Ioaded waveguides in microwave components, their basic electrical properties are, in general, theoretically unknown. Analytic solution is prohibited, except for a few simple geometries, by the difficulty of matching electric and magnetic fields at the air-dielectric interface; consequently, recent efforts to find a solution have employed numerical methods. In this paper, the finite element method will be applied in an unrestricted sense to inhomogeneous waveguides and some computed results wilI be presented."
"The simplest and most frequently used method employed in the calculation of waveguide wall losses proceeds as follows: (1) solve the electromagnetic field under the assumption that the walls are perfectly conducting; (2) calculate the wall currents through knowledge of the magnetic field tangential to the wall; (3) square the current, at each point on the conductor surface, and multiply by the equivalent resistance due to skin effect R/sub s/ = /spl radic/ /spl omega//spl mu//sub o/ / 2/spl sigma/; and (4) integrate over the entire surface to obtain the total power loss. Note that the initial assumption of perfectly conducting walls excludes six-component hybrid fields from consideration --- which, in fact, must exist."

"Figures 1 and 2 give the FM and AM noise of typical X-Band and Gunn and avalanche diode oscillators. These data are typical and not essentially different from the early data presented by Josenhans. Most differences in the FM noise can be explained by the changes in circuit Q with great reduction in the FM noise obtained only by increasing the circuit Q by energy storage in an additional stabilizing cavity. Differences in AM data can usually be accounted for by the bias circuit impedance or by threshold problems in the AM noise measurement equipment. This is particularly true for the Gunn diode oscillator because the AM noise is low enough that only a Schottky barrier diode is capable of making the measurement."
"The FM noise spectrum of a Gunn diode operated in any microwave circuit may be calculated from three noise parameters and the results of simple microwave measurements. These three noise parameters, one describing thermal noise properties and two describing flicker noise properties are assigned to each diode as a result of noise measurements made in a standard test circuit."
"This paper shows cavity stabilization of microwave oscillators can be characterized by a Type O (AFC) servomechanism. Stabilized phase noise spectral density can now be analyzed as a function of modulation rate. Measured phase noise data of stabilized IMPATT and Gunn oscillators are compared with the new theory."
"Microwave solid state oscillators such as IMPATT and Gunn oscillators are coming into practical uses. These are very impressive devices, but having several practical problems. They include insufficient frequency stability for temperature variations, insufficient output power level as a transmitter oscillator, and higher noise level. Currently, the output power level of commercially available IMPATT diodes are improving, and more than several watts is obtainable in laboratory. If the frequency stability and noise problems are solved without much increasing the oscillator size, the IMPATT oscillator can replace conventional oscillators in many applications."
"To obtain the highly stable and low noise gunn or avalanche diode oscillator, there are two methods, the one is an injection locking to a master oscillator and the other is a cavity stabilization."
"It is well known that the noise factor of a linear two-port depends on the impedance (or reflectance) of the source connected to it. This is easily understood if the noise sources inside the device are replaced by equivalent amplitude sources, one at each port. These sources produce outward traveling waves which are, in general, partially correlated. Thus if the wave at port 1 is reflected by the source mismatch it will interfere with the wave at 2 in a manner that depends on the source reflectance W."

"By using Cohn's slotline in combination with a microstrip, simple 90/spl deg/ as well as 180/spl deg/ directional couplers of any coupling value can be made. As examples an ultra flat 10 db coupler for 1 - 12 GHz, an octave wide (2 - 4 GHz) magic tee and an almost lumped proximity coupler for 2 - 8 GHz (all on alumina substrate) have been made."
"The slot transmission line on high dielectric constant substrates provides a microwave medium for fabricating microwave filters that could have application to integrated circuits. Specifically, configurations which yield band-pass and band-stop filter characteristics are being investigated; coupling data has been obtained and several experimental filters have been constructed. The investigation was performed at frequencies near 3 GHz using circuits fabricated primarily on 0.063 inch thick, Trans Tech D-16, substrate material. The substrates were metallized using either aluminum sensing tape (3M No. 51) or using a combination of electroless and electroplating in order to deposit copper to a thickness of approximately 0.001 inch."
"A new type of planar balanced circuit, suitable for the realization of broadband microwave mixers and frequency multipliers, in integrated circuit form, was described in September 1969. In this circuit, a hybrid junction was formed by joining a slot transmission line and a coplanar transmission line. Four diodes were connected at the junction in the form of a ring to realize a balanced mixer."
"This paper describes a wideband X-band image rejection mixer constructed in microstrip using a thin-glazed alumina substrate. This mixer has a 10 to 11.3 dB noise figure and over 20-dB image rejection over an 8 to 12 GHz frequency band. Image rejection is achieved by using a pair of balanced mixers with signal and LO voltages fed in quadrature and in phase, respectively. Such circuits have been previously constructed in waveguide and conventional strip transmission line; the microstrip mixer described herein achieves comparable electrical performance in a much smaller volume and weight than X-band designs developed in these other transmission media."
"The availability of high dielectric constant substrates with superior electrical and physical properties is credited with the revival of microstrip designs. This paper demonstrates that it is also possible to successfully design microstrip circuits on metal clad plastic materials that have a low dielectric constant."
"In terms of the number of components, the tunnel diode amplifier is one of the least complex RF amplifiers available. It has never achieved broad acceptance because of high cost, poor reliability, and problems of instability. The recent success of planar fabrication techniques promises to eliminate these drawbacks. By integrating planar tunnel diodes with printed microwave circuitry, reliable low-cost, high-performance tunnel diode amplifiers should be feasible."
"Many methods have been devised to achieve accurate tracking capability in antenna systems. The sequential Iobing technique was one of the earliest methods and was commonly used in early airborne-interceptor RADAR. Sequential Iobing provides angle tracking information via amplitude comparisons between time shared antenna beam positions. This method has now been largely replaced by conical scan and monopulse tracking techniques. Conical scanning is achieved by mechanical or electrical rotation of the antenna beam axis. The output amplitude is then analyzed to provide directional error signals. The monopulse technique uses multiple, simultaneous beams to provide complete angular tracking information in real time."

"It has been reported that a parallel connected silicon avalanche oscillator produced 4.7 Watts of CW power at 13.3 GHz. The improved performance of this oscillator resulted from the reduction of the thermal resistance between a wafer and heat sink using a parallel connection of wafers on a diamond pellet. The thermal conductivity of type-IIa diamond has been reported to exceed that of copper. In this report, the type-IIa diamond has been applied to the heat sink of a Gunn oscillator diode in order to reduce the thermal spreading resistance under the wafer of the diode. And a single Gunn oscillator diode with high power output over 600 mW has been developed."
"In this paper we shall describe recent results with reflection type wide band solid state power amplifiers which show promise of replacing tubes in many microwave systems. These amplifiers are fabricated from epitaxial GaAs transferred electron devices which are stabilized through the use of low impedance circuits to form stable wideband linear cw amplifiers. Output powers in C-band of more than 250 mW over a 1 dB bandwidth of 3 GHz with a gain of 7 dB have been achieved. Saturated power outputs of 1 watt with 3 dB gain have also been achieved. In X-band, power outputs of over 150 mW over a 2 GHz bandwidth with 4 dB has been achieved."
"Relaxation oscillations in bulk GaAs diodes in high impedance circuits have been analysed by a computer simulation by B. I . Jeppsson, and by W. Camp. At frequencies lower than the transit time frequency they have been observed in lumped circuits by Lanza and Esposito. In this paper we report time domain observation of LSA-relaxation oscillations in distributed circuits which tune over a wide range and have high peak powers as predicted in this mode of oscillation."
"A reflection-type single-sideband modulator is described that uses two PIN diodes separated by /spl lambda/ / 8. The modulator can give satisfactory suppression of undesired sidebands in a noncritical circuit, and computer simulations indicate that 20-dB suppression of the unwanted sidebands can be obtained over an octave bandwidth. It can provide even wider bandwidths when conventional C-section differential phase shifters are used."

"During the last decade a large variety of inhomogeneous guided wave structures have been analysed in order to enable them to be used as microwave components. Circular or rectangular waveguides inhomogeneously loaded with dielectrics, ferrites or plasmas together with the conventional microstrip structures are probably the most common devices which have been analysed. However, few significant results have been obtained relating to the fundamental restrictions upon the behaviour of these classes of structures."
"When the physical dimensions are adjusted properly, the periodic linear arrays, commonly known as Yagi-Uda arrays, may possibly be used as open waveguides or directional antennas operating at two or more widely separated frequency bands.

"A method for designing a ridged waveguide transmission line so that its phase shift will be insensitive to temperature changes has been devised. Design equations and curves for choosing the ridge dimensions are presented, as well as curves of the guide attenuation and the compensation bandwidth. Experimental verification of the compensation effect by means of a resonant ridged waveguide cavity is shown."
"Basic capacitance matrix data have been computed for single, double and triple microstrip, using the method of moments. This basic design data has been computed for a wide variety of physical configurations and dielectric constants. Typical charge distributions have also been obtained. The method is applicable to a number of microstrip problems."
"This paper presents an effective method for computing the transient response of an n-conductor, coupled transmission-line system, which is characterized by multiple propagation modes of unequal phase velocities. To derive the computational algorithm, an equivalent circuit consisting of n decoupled transmission lines in conjunction with two congruence transformers was constructed and converted into two disjointed resistive n-ports. It is shown that the electrical behavior of the coupled transmission lines can be completely described by the static capacitance matrices of the conductor system. The experimental result obtained on a three-conductor, microstrip printed circuit was found to be in excellent agreement with the computed result."

"Efficient solid state X- band power generation can be accomplished by utilizing the negative impedance characteristics of avalanche diodes in reflection amplifiers. Breadboard 7 GC circuits have been constructed which exhibit low level gains of 13 db with 500 mc of bandwidth. Power outputs of 1 w cw, with 5 db of gain and 20% conversion efficiency have been realized in the same circuit."
"A method of measuring the rf impedance of an oscillating avalanche diode is described, and a technique for comparing calculated and measured rf impedance values for a variety of diffused Ge diode structures is considered. The value of this measurement method rests with its ability to provide values of the diode rf impedances under both large-signal and small-signal conditions for CW and pulsed operation in either the single-frequency or multifrequency mode of oscillation. The totality of these characteristics clearly delineates the uniqueness of this technique compared with conventional slotted-line measurements."
"Silicon IMP ATT diodes have been used in a reflectance amplifier circuit to achieve a DC to RF conversion efficiency of 50 percent at S-band with 8 to 10 dB gain and 10 watts peak output. The RF circuit used was a four slug coaxial structure similar to that used by others in the production of high efficiency oscillations. A pulse width of one microsecond at a repetition rate of 5 KHz was used. The circuit configuration of the reflectance amplifier is shown in Figure 1."
"Two types of avalanche diodes are presently being used for microwave generation and amplification, the Read diodes, which have either n+-p-i-p+ or p+-n-i-n+ structure, and IMPATT and high-efficiency diodes which are simple p-n junctions usually with p+-n-n+ or n+-p-p+ structure. These devices are conventionally fabricated by diffusion techniques with the first layer epitaxially deposited on the substrate. Two other fabrication techniques which promise better device characteristics for junction devices are the ion-implantation and multiple-epitaxial techniques. This paper describes the fabrication, characteristics and performance of both Read and IMPATT diodes fabricated by the multiple-epitaxial technique."
"It is often required that a microwave source be of high power and fixed frequency and at the same time give low noise and be highly stable. Conventional coaxial circuits are somewhat impractical at millimetre wavelengths. The \"hat\" has been used with some success but its tuning characteristics are not readily understood, and so it is difficult to design for specific applications. A new coax-waveguide configuration has evolved which, it is believed, satisfies these requirements rather well in the 3-7 mm band, and it has accordingly been adopted for the power source of a path-length modulation transmitter. Results obtained have shown powers of 200 mw at 5% efficiency, temperature sensitivity as low as 300 kHz/ /spl deg/C, and external Q factor around 200."
"A new form of microstrip isolator is described here which was discovered during our search for an improved technique to obtain stable amplification with negative-resistance diodes distributed along a transmission line. We also report its successful application to that problem. This device uses a principle of nonreciprocal wave propagation which is also suitable for circulators. It may find other applications."

"This paper will describe a family of Surface Wave accoustic delay lines in the 100 MHz to 1100 MHz frequency range which offer a practical way of satisfying many system delay line requirements more easily than with conventional bulk type delay lines. Microwave surface wave delay lines are made by evaporating metallic thin film interdigital transducers on a polished surface of a piezoelectric single crystal material such as lithium niobate. The transducer, whose impedance is determined by the coupling constant of the piezoelectric substrate and the geometry of the transducer electrodes, is matched to system impedances with relatively simple matching circuitry. The transducers are composed of a properly interconnected sequence of parallel lines which may be .85 - 6 microns wide, depending upon the frequency range. In contrast, microwave bulk wave transducers are made by either depositing an oriented piezoelectric thin film on the polished end of a single crystal rod, or by diffusing an insulated layer into the polished end of a relatively high conductivity piezoelectric semiconductor."
"Microwave delay lines are of considerable interest because of the large time-bandwidth products that can be realized. Recently it has become possible to extend acoustic surface-wave technology into the microwave frequency range using the sub-micron capability of the scanning electron microscope. This paper reports the design and fabrication of a broadband multi-tapped delay line, centered at L-Band. Emphasis is placed on the microwave characterization of the low-frequency transducer circuit model, performance as strong and weak wideband taps, analysis of transducer and propagation is unique to loss contributions, as well as the fabrication technology which the realization of long, low-loss microwave delay lines."
"The effect of beam steering on the design of microwave acoustic surface wave devices is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Transducer, pure mode axis misalignment and misalignment of the propagation-plane perpendicular can both add significantly to delay line insertion loss. Beam steering losses are particularly high on Y-cut, Z-propagating LiNbO/sub 3/."
"Frequency coding of acoustic waves through the use of multi-element arrays has provided a unique solution to RADAR systerns requiring pulse compression. The recent advance in efficient coupling to surface acoustic waves on single crystal piezoelectric materials has resulted in the simplification in design of these devices. This simplification occurs because the transducer is made up of a two dimensional conducting metal film array which is produced by the standard photo-etch technique used in microcircuits. This paper discusses the control of phase and amplitude variations in a dispersive delay line using such an array and the resultant side lobe suppression achieved."

"Magnetic ceramics of the ferrimagnetic structure are widely used in the microwave field. Many types are used so little attempt will be made here to cover all aspects of microwave ferrimagnetic ceramic materials. Three basic types or classes of magnetic crystal structures have found wide application in microwave components. These three classes of ferrimagnetic oxides are ferrites (spinels), garnets, and hexagonal materials. Each of these types contains families of completely different compositions, all of which possess their unique properties and characteristics applicable to microwave uses."
"The characteristics of ferrite materials desired for microwave devices with the material operated in the remanent state have been reviewed by Ince and Temme. The major deficiencies in the material for such applications have been the sensitivities of the remanent magnetization to both temperature and stress. Of the two most commonly used material systems, Mg-Mn ferrites and yttritum-iron garnets, the temperature sensitivity of the remanent magnetization of the garnet is less severe, particularly at low magnetization values. However, the stress sensitivity of the garnet is significantly greater than that of the ferrites and consequently, presents a serious problem for latching devices. Following earlier attempts to reduce the stress sensitivity through rare earth additions, which proved lossy, Dionne, et al. have shown that a small manganese addition to yttrium-iron garnet is effective for the reduction of magnetostriction. They have presented data suggesting that the microwave characteristics would also be satisfactory."
"Past investigations of reciprocal, ferrite microstrip phase shifters have been concentrated on the effects of longitudinal magnetization (parallel to the microstrip) on the phase-shifting properties of linear sections of microstrip. The effect of a transverse magnetization in the plane of the substrate on the phase velocity of the propagating fields has been assumed to be nil. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the phase shift induced by transverse magnetization has both a reciprocal and a non-reciprocal component and the composite phase shift induced by transverse magnetization is in the direction opposite to the phase shift generated by the longitudinal magnetization. Some non-reciprocal phase shift has been previously reported for widely spaced meander lines, but the effect was attributed to coupling between the lines. The presence of the non-reciprocal phase shift in a single linear section of microstrip is evidence of the fact that the propagating microstrip mode is not purely TEM in nature. This TEM approximation is generally made, although it has long been known that the wave is not pure."
"An attractive method for producing reciprocal phase shift is to use a pair of identical nonreciprocal phase shifters with circulators at input and output, as shown in Figure 1. In this scheme, signals passing from left to right are sent through the lower phase shifter, while signals passing from right to left are sent through the upper phase shifter. By switching the phase shifters in a complementary manner, equal variable insertion phases can be provided for either direction of propagation. This approach to achieving reciprocal phase shift yields the desirable bandwidth, figure of merit, and temperature stability advantages of nonreciprocal phase shifters, except that it is more complicated and has the additional losses of the input and output circulators. However, the added complexity can be significantly reduced by employing a dual-mode transmission line in which the two nonreciprocal phase shifters occupy the same physical space. It is the purpose of this paper to describe the principle of operation, physical realization, and performance parameters for a reciprocal phase shifter of this latter type."
"Industry has given considerable attention to the development of low-cost phase shifters to be used as beam steering elements in phased array RADARs. Latching reciprocal ferrite phase shifters have received special attention because of the following considerations: (1) they can handle relatively high peak and average power levels, (2) they require no bias to maintain a phase setting, and (3) their reciprocal nature allows transmitting and receiving functions to occur without resetting the array. This paper presents a technique for obtaining a low loss X-band reciprocal latching ferrite phase shifter. The phase shifter is described by first considering the propagation constant of the circularly-polarized phase shift section and then discussing the nonreciprocal circular polarizers which are necessary to obtain reciprocal phase shift. The theoretical and experimental results of the phase shifter are then presented."
"This paper describes a new dual mode reciprocal phaser which operates at peak power levels of 100 kW and average power levels of 1500 watts over a -65/spl deg/C to +85/spl deg/C ambient temperature range. The device operates over a 370 frequency band centered at mid S-band. The total phase dispersion for the device is <5/spl deg/ for 200/spl deg/ differential phase shift. Details of the thermal design and ferrimagnetic materials selection are presented. Experimental data are given which indicates that the total insertion phase of the device varies less than 10/spl deg/ when incident average power is varied between 100 and 1100 watts. Little, if any change in differential phase shift is observed over this power range. Other similar phase shifters which provide up to 1000/spl deg/ differential phase shift at lower peak power levels are discussed."
"The evolution of airborne phased arrays has created a need for small, lightweight phase shift elements, capable of high switching speeds and offering the prospect of quantity production at moderate cost. Microstrip diode phase shifters have been developed to meet these needs with peak power handling capabilities up to a hundred watts. This paper describes a novel extension of the use of these circuits to kilowatt power levels."
"The electronically-scanned antenna, for which this phase-shifter was designed, requires the ability to switch the sense of circular polarization radiated or received by each antenna element. This necessary feature, together with the ability to control each antenna element phase in steps of 45-degrees, is provided by one microwave assembly, shown in Figure 1."

"One of the exciting new possibilities in the microwave field today is that of true microminiaturization with acoustic surface wave circuitry. Two of the possible acoustic surface waveguides which have been proposed are shown in Fig. 1. The behavior of these waveguides and of the circuits which could utilize them are not well understood, however, because of the complexity associated with boundary value problems involving acoustic waves in solids."
"When a Rayleigh wave is generated on a piezoelectric substrate, coupling to the Rayleigh wave on an adjacent piezoelectric substrate can be effected via the evanescent electric field in the air gap when the two substrates are brought close together. If the adjacent substrate is not piezoelectric, however, this method is no longer feasible and an alternative scheme must be employed. Such a scheme has recently been proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The coupling under these conditions is achieved by inserting a layer of fluid or solid between the two substrates, and energy is transferred via the mechanical rather than electric field."
"Research in the past several years on bulk acoustic devices, notably on delay lines, is now broadening to include a much larger family of devices because of recent developments in surface wave acoustics. Publications by White and Tiersten have shown that the elastic surface wave (Rayleigh wave) can be guided by a superficial layer which is about one wavelength thick. Tiersten provided a theoretical analysis for two types of guides, a strip guide in which a narrow film is deposited in the desired direction of propagation and a slot guide in which the film is deposited everywhere except in the desired direction of propagation. Tiersten's theoretical dispersion curves are presented along with a description of the useful single mode region which establishes a bandwidth limitation much as in conventional waveguide."
"A theoretical and experimental investigation leading to the design and fabrication of surface wave directional couplers is discussed. A simple theoretical model for surface acoustic waveguides developed by Adkins and Hughes serves as the foundation for the present investigation. In this model guidance is achieved by thin gold strips deposited on fused quartz. This single guide model was then extended to the double guide structure which serves as a basis for coupled mode devices. A preliminary account of this work has been previously reported. Calculated coupling lengths, decay lengths, and modal amplitude ratios were found to be in good agreement with experiment. The double guide model was then employed for the design and fabrication of directional coupler devices. A brief account of this work is reported in Ref. 3. The general agreement between theory and experiment indicates that the model constitutes the basic foundation for design of practical coupled mode devices."
"In this paper we report the results of an investigation of the propagation of ultrasonic surface waves In \"Y\"-cut lithium niobate crystals which have geometrically shaped thin gold film structures similar to optical prisms placed in the propagation path of the sound wave. The method of investigation using a pulsed argon laser is a variation of the CW laser optical spatial filter imaging technique recently developed here for optically recording the propagation paths of surface ultrasonic waves in piezoelectric and non-piezoelectric media."
"The realization of complex microsound circuits would be greatly facilitated if one were able, efficiently to reflect the surface waves. For example, such reflectors are required for making a \"short-circuited\" stub, or for a low mode-order resonator. It is known that the interdigital transducer can reflect a surface wave, with rather low losses; however, this approach involves the use of an external inductive tuning circuit, which must be attached to the transducer in order to resonate its self-capacitance. It is therefore a method which cannot be used in those situations where the primary objective is the achievement of very large component densities."

"Many broadband 3-port waveguide circulators have dielectric spacers between the ferrite and the broad walls of the waveguide junction, as shown in Figure 1. In terms of the two-resonant mode theory employed to explain the Y junction circulator, these spacers were regarded as impedance adjustments which were needed to produce broadband circulation."
"A thin film lumped element circulator using only cross-over capacitances and a single capacitor comon to all three ports, the equivalent circuit of which is shown in Figure 1a, has yielded a 20 dB bandwidth > 30%."
"Two classes of spurious response in waveguide circulators are described. Examples of these responses from previous work are shown. One class of spurious response is a well known \"spiking\" phenomenon which has not previously been discussed explicitly. This type of response is identified as one or more resonant modes of the open post resonator formed by the cylindrical ferrite/dielectric configuration between the conducting top and bottom walls of the circulator cavity. The second class of spurious response is related to the h-port circulator problem which gives good agreement between theory and experiment for unmagnetized ferrite, and good agreement near the maximum-isolation frequency for magnetized ferrite, but gives generally poor results outside this frequency range. Directions of continuing work are indicated."
"Recently many latching switches are investigated and reported on. The switch proposed here is a kind of circulators but a new one which has different structure from usual switches. This switch has relatively compact dimensions as a high power switch, and gives little variation of VSWR during switching, and makes it possible to divide out-put power between two ports at arbitrary rate. This paper describes the structure, the principle of operation, the numerical estimation of isolation characteristics and the experimental results of this switch."
"Some progress has been reported in the development of nonreciprocal and magnetically variable devices in the microstrip transmission medium. Further investigation and analysis remain in order for optimum performance to be characterized theoretically and achieved in practice. The objectives are to achieve favorable performance in insertion loss and bandwidth of phase shifters and other components, an acceptable combination of microwave characteristics and switching properties in variable devices, and freedom from spurious interactions between these components and the circuits in which they are imbedded."
"The recent discovery of amplified ferrimagnetic echoes (AFE) suggests that a number of microwave signal processing applications may be realized to advantage with this new technology. These include pulse amplification and delay, pulse compression, frequency multiplexing, and spectrum analysis. The results described below were obtained in YIG crystals at room temperature in the frequency range 8 - 12 GHz."
"The epitaxial growth of yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films on gallium garnet (GGG) has allowed the construction of microwave gadolinium devices compatible with current microwave integrated technology. This paper describes the construction and operation of a bandpass filter and a band-sectioning filterbank."

"Recently, there is much renewed interest in dielectric surface waveguides in view of their potential application in communications at the millimetric and optical frequencies. Many of the theoretical and practical problems involved were discussed in an informative survey by Kao. Among them, the excitation of surface waves on these waveguiding structures is, evidently, of much importance. One of the simplest structures, which is, nevertheless, of great practical utility, is the circular dielectric rod. The excitation of circularly symmetric surface waves on a dielectric rod by an elementary source, for example, a nagnetic current ring, has been investigated previously. However, a similar treatment for the HE/sub 11/ dipole mode is not available. The excitation of the HE/sub 11/ mode is of great practical importance, since it is the dominant mode and the easiest one to excite in a pure form if a single-mode operation is desired. Consequently, the HE/sub 11/ mode has been widely used. Snyder used an asymptotic approach in dealing with the excitation of modes on a semi-infinite dielectric rod, since the exact Green's functions for the fields were not known except for the circularly symmetric modes (TM/sub Om/ or TE/sub Om/). It is the purpose of the present paper to present a theoretical study of the problem of exciting the HE/sub 11/ mode."
"Recently an X-band, dual-channel rotary joint was needed for the airborne terminal of a satellite communication link. Low losses were necessary in the high average power transmit channel (l2.5 KW, CW) to avoid excessive temperature rise, and in the receive channel to reduce the noise temperature of the system. Other important considerations were: no liquid or forced-air cooling; restricted size limitations; low cross-coupling between channels. A new type of rotary joint combining the TM/sub 01/ mode and the circularly-polarized TE/sub 11/ mode in circular waveguide was developed which satisfied the electrical, thermal , and size requirements of the system."
"Summary form only given, as follows. A record of the panel discussion was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. The purpose of this panel is to discuss some of the most recent applications of microwave integrated circuits in the design of microwave components and systems. The basic questions to be answered are (l) what are some of the real and practical applications of MIC's today, and (2) what applications are planned for the immediate future? Each member of the panel will make a brief formal presentation discussing some of the principal applications and some of the problems involved in using microwave integrated circuits. Members of the audience are encouraged to participate in the discussion. Facilities to show slides will be available for everyone."

"In this paper \"inverted common collector\" transistor resonator filters will be analyzed. Simple formulas will be presented for the input immittance parameters, in terms of the bridged-T equivalent network and in terms of the common-emitter Y parameters. A design procedure is suggested, and a design example given. Stability of the resultant circuitry is discussed."
"A consideration of the field distribution and the characteristics of an H guide with a laminated dielectric bar composed of an arbitrary number of dielectric strips separated by air layers is presented. Low-loss wave modes with the electric field intensity predominantly parallel to the sidewalls are analyzed. Approximate thin-layer equations are derived which indicate methods for improvements of the attenuation of the H guide."
"The problem of finding a characteristic polynomial to provide equiripple delay characteristics in commensurate TEM microwave networks is solved numerically. These polynomials enable the synthesis of such filters in the form of cascaded transmission lines or in the form of stub filters to be undertaken. Results for the orders 2 through 6 are presented. The synthesis of constant delay all-pass networks can also be performed and the method for doing so is presented. The attenuation characteristic corresponding to the equiripple delay filter does not, of course, possess a sharp cutoff, since these filters are of the minimum phase type."
"The complete performance of a lossless three-port H-plane waveguide junction loaded coaxially with various inhomogeneous ferrite cylanders has been evaluated over the waveguide bandwidth and compared with experiment. Qualitative agreement between the predicted and measured performance was generally good using only the first three modes, n=0/spl plusmn/1. It has been shown theoretically and verified experimentally that if the 4/spl pi/M/sub s/ of a homogeneous rod or the internal field is increased, the circulation frequency f/sub 0/ increases; conversely, if the pemittivity is increased, f/sub 0/ decreases. These conflicting effects are modified when the magnetization 4/spl pi/M/sub s/ and permittivity /spl epsiv/ are inhomogeneous. For example, if the 4/spl pi/M/sub s/(/spl gamma/) is small at the outer surface of the rod (with permittivity held constant), the effect on f/sub 0/ is very small; but if 4/spl pi/M/sub s/(spl gamma) approaches zero for /spl gamma/ small, then f/sub 0/ may decrease significantly. On the other hand, if /spl epsiv//sub/spl gamma//(/spl gamma/) approaches unity near the outer surface of the rod, f/sub 0/ may increase significantly; but if /spl epsiv//sub/spl gamma//(/spl gamma/) approaches unity near the center of the rod, f/sub 0/ is affected relatively little. The inhomogeneous structure has also shown that decreasing the ferrite volume may improve the performance, and high-power applications are suggested. With a conducting pin down the center of the ferrite, relative bandwidths of 40-50 percent are predicted."
"A method is given for the numerical determination of the coefficients of capacitance for a class of multiconductor transmission-line systems. This class includes systems without ground planes, or with one or two ground planes, with the lines embedded in one or two layers of dielectrics. The conductors can be of any cross section that can be approximated adequately by polygons. The method is a refinement of the subareas method in which the assumption of a \"staircase function\" surface charge density, that is, constant charge density over each subarea, is replaced by the assumption of a piecewise linear charge density over the conductor surfaces, and the charge density parameters are determined by making a least-squares fit to the potential to the boundary conditions of the problem."
"A circuit is described which uses an abrupt junction varactor to electronically tune an IMPATT oscillator. Linear voltage frequency tuning is obtained over a 10 percent frequency band."
"A small analog X-band stripline phase shifter using commercially available ferrites provides a figure of merit of 300/spl deg/ /dB, average coil drive power of 30 mW and element weight less than 4 oz. Experiments on an element using a new zinc-doped magnesium-manganese ferrite have given a figure of merit of 450/spl deg/ /dB."
"This note considers the approximation problem encountered in the synthesis of branch-guide couplers. An alternate solution to that proposed by R. Levy and L. F. Lind is considered and shown to give generally inferior performance. It is inferred then, that an important design criterion is the requirement that the passband of the coupler contains the maximum number of frequencies of perfect match consistent with elements that are a quarter-wave-length long at midband."
"This correspondence describes some measurements of intermodulation product and switching noise amplitudes at UHF in a p-i-n diode switch."
"One form of the lumped-constant circulator consists of a mesh arrangement of three short-circuited striplines arranged at 120/spl deg/ which are insulated from each other. If the mesh arrangements are electrically short the energy within the disk geometry is essentially magnetic. In this correspondence the inductance associated with this magnetic energy is calculated by forming the input impedance of the mesh. Because of the geometry used the characteristic impedance and phase velocity of this transmission line are those associated with the even-mode excitation of two coupled lines. Graphical results are given for both the stripline and microstrip cases."
"It is verified experimentally and theoretically that highly reflective out-of-band characteristics are inherent in the usual stripline circulator, and follow a certain regularity. It is then described how a small-sized additional network to the circulator can improve its out-of-band characteristics. Using the improved circulator with this network, it is shown how to design a small-size wide-band TDA."
"In this correspondence, numerical calculations have been carried out for the reflection and transmission coefficients of various order fields scattered from strip gratings. The work is based on an integral equation formulation followed by Galerkin's method of solution. The results exhibit the occurrence of Wood anomalies at the so-called Rayleigh wavelengths."
"Even mode impedances of coupled pairs of microstrip lines have been computed, and corresponding odd mode impedances have been empirically estimated. The analysis is based on the superposition of solutions for single rnicrostrip lines."
"A new form of quasi-optical waveguide component has been designed that is based on use of the Brewster angle and on the rapid variation of reflectance and change of phase near the critical angle. An attenuator was built in S-band waveguide and its performance measured at 35 and 94 GHz. Diffraction is the limiting factor on the device operation, so practical device applications will likely be limited to 1-mm wavelengths and less."
"This correspondence describes the design of a high intermediate frequency mixer based on the use of a broad-band stripline magic T. Advantages of the design include the ability to process RF signals down to the upper IF band edge without diplexer crossover loss. Experimental results are presented."
"A variational bound (minimum) principle originally introduced in quantum mechanical scattering problems is here adapted to the scattering of electromagnetic waves by a nonsymmetric obstacle in a rectangular waveguide. Numerical results are given for a simple case."
"This correspondence describes experimental results in the 50-GHz band on one-resonator and two-resonator maximally flat directional filters. The center frequencies of these filters can be smoothly changed over a wide range by means of two kinds of novel tuning mechanisms."
"It is shown that a medium whose dielectric constant has a square-law distribution with complex coefficients possesses guided mode solutions even under the extreme condition that both the real and the imaginary part of the index of refraction have their lowest value at the axis of the waveguide. However, the resulting modes are unstable (pseudomodes). Stable guided modes exist if the imaginary part of the refractive index has its highest value on axis."
"The inverse iteration method of analyzing an isotropic waveguide is reexamined with a view to finding the higher order modes. It is shown that the problem may be formulated in terms of a generalized biharmonic operator, which is always at least semidefinite. Several finite-difference representations are given for this operator. Of these, two possess property A, a point of fundamental importance for iterative solution by successive overrelaxation."
"A low-noise microwave detector has been developed for use with high CW carrier power and low modulation frequency. Under some conditions, the sensitivity and noise temperature of this device are better than those exhibited by the best crystal video detectors."
"The \"method of moments\" is used to calculate the capacity per unit length of a microstrip transmission line. The characteristic impedance is obtained by assuming TEM mode of propagation. The values of the impedance calculated by this method are in good agreement with the results reported by Wheeler and Sobol."
"The dominant mode of the open-sided shielded stripline is TEM and has rightly received considerable attention. Few analyses of its non-TEM properties are available. Oliner and Samuilov have assumed the existence of higher order modes and calculated cutoff frequencies through a transverse resonance approach. Brackelmann et al. have made computations through series-matching, and report that non-TEM modes do not exist for open-sided shielded stripline. Bolle and Eaves, through a Wiener-Hopf technique, have made calculations that substantiate this. Ilenborg and Pregla have made calculations through series matching for a stripline of two strips and report H modes. However, such numerical results allow strict conclusions only for the specific parameters chosen, and, furthermore, the conclusions are subject to computational error. These practical considerations along with the aesthetic make a non-numerical investigation desirable. It will be shown that the shielded stripline, and indeed a general class of parallel-plate waveguide structures, do not support non-TEM modes."
"Attention is called to the fact that most planar ferrites are not adequately described by a single crystalline anisotropy constant. The presence of higher order terms in the anisotropy is important if resonance with the static field out of the easy plane is considered."
"This correspondence deals with the analysis and measurement of TE/sub 11/ /spl deg/ /spl rarr/ TM/sub 11/ /spl deg/ mode conversion by circularly symmetric transducers in a circular waveguide. Two types are considered, the simple step change in radius and a discontinuity covered by a dielectric ring. For the first type, experimental results for both amplitude and phase are compared with predictions made on the basis of a computer program, with excellent agreement. The dielectric loaded transducer is of great interest since measurements have shown that such a device can be designed to launch the two modes with a relative amplitude and phase which is essentially independent of frequency over a very wide range. This configuration is therefore an excellent candidate for use in low-noise microwave antenna systems."
"To facilitate the study of wave propagation along curved structures, such as curved waveguides and antennas, it is desirable to have an orthogonal coordinate system for an arbitrary smooth curve. Such a coordinate system can be derived from the Serret-Frenet frame of the curve."
"A set of three nomograms yields directly the phase and amplitude of the output signal in terms of the two input signals for an ideal and symmetric hybrid combiner."
"This correspondence summarizes some consequences of \"skin effect\" for high-frequency IMPATT diodes. The enormous current densities, well in excess of 10/sup 5/ A/cm/sup 2/, currently employed in high-frequency IMPATT diodes are shown to cause nonuniform current distributions due to skin effect in diodes of conventional dimensions. These nonuniformities in turn preclude high efficiency. They also provide an explanation for the small increase in output power attained in pulse operation, in which even higher current densities are experienced than in CW operation. Practical means of reducing these effects exist within semiconductor technology and are briefly discussed."

"When finite difference techniques are applied to the solution of coupled-line parameters for microstrip transmission lines, the computation times become prohibitively long. This paper describes an analytical method for calculating such parameters if TEM propagation is assumed. The method is applicable to a wide range of planar TEM mode transmission line calculations where the boundaries and dielectric interfaces are rectilinear. The accuracy of the analytical technique has been verified by experimental work on 10 dB and 6 dB coupled-line directional couplers and a parallel-coupled Cohn type 6 resonator filter."
"The structure consisting of an E-plane dielectric slab partially filling a rectangular waveguide is examined with attention on those higher order mode propagation characteristics that are relevant to the design of nonreciprocal remanence ferrite phase shifters. The validity of the model is established by introducing experimental comparison in the form of VSWR measurements for both pure dielectric loading and an actual composite ferrite phase shifter. Emphasis is placed on the consideration of possible mechanisms for the elimination of LSE/sub 11/, LSM/sub 11/, and LSE/sub 12/ modes, since certainly the first, most probably the second, and quite possibly the third will propagate in a practical device. Experimental verification of theoretical predictions is established and phaser design guidelines are drawn. Some additional topics, such as slabcorner chamfering and the effect of the switching wire, are included for completeness."
"A numerical procedure is described for processing the data of a microwave measurement in which the measured points are distributed in a form of a circle in a complex plane. Instead of plotting the measured data on a Smith chart and analyzing them by graphical methods, the data are analyzed by the method of least squares. The result of this analysis consists of three complex numbers K, L, and M, which define the bilinear transformation in question. The procedure is illustrated on the example of impedance versus bias measurements on a varactor diode which was recently described by E. W. Sard. The necessary formulas are derived for computation of elements of the equivalent circuit from the above constants K, L, and M. The procedure is well-suited for programming a digital computer."
"The equivalent circuit of an orthogonal-loop-coupled magnetic resonance filter is shown to consist of a gyrator, two ferrite-induced inductances, and two coupling loop inductances. The effects of the coupling inductances on the passband and stopband responses are shown to be significant by means of calculations based on this equivalent circuit. It is proved that the maximum passband bandwidth /spl Delta//spl conint//sub -3dB/ = /spl conint//sub 0/ (L/sub f/ / L/sub c/), where /spl conint//sub 0/, is the center frequency, and L/sub f/ and L/sub c/ the ferrite-induced and the coupling-loop inductance, respectively. Other unusual insertion-loss characteristics of this filter which differ from those of a conventional reciprocal-element bandpass filter are shown. Finally, a test circuit for determining experimentally the coupling inductance ratio L/sub c/ /L/sub f/ and the external Q, Q/sub f/ of a ferrite resonator is presented."
"Traditionally the phenomenological constitutive relations for piezoelectric materials explicitly relate the electric displacement D/spl ovbr/ the electric intensity E/spl ovbr/, the stress tensor, and the strain tensor. This paper presents a new formulation for the theory of coupled wave interactions in a class of important hexagonal piezoelectric devices; here an equivalent dielectric description explicitly involving only D/spl ovbr/ and E/spl ovbr/ replaces (without approximation) the traditional formulation. The new formulation supplies the foundation for a new determination of power flow and energy storage on a basis broad enough to include the effects of diffusion and collisions on multivelocity multispecies carrier streams. The results, when specialized to a single-velocity single-species carrier stream, differ significantly with others recently proposed for those circumstances. The general results display a considerable degree of compactness and simplicity and are \"electrically invariant\" in that they hold for insulating, photoconducting, and semiconducting piezoelectric materials without any change in basic form."
"Analysis of calibration data of a rotary-vane attenuator has yielded closer agreement between the recently developed off-null and the proven power ratio methods of attenuation measurement. A constant bias was discovered in the measured valures of attenuation difference, and a procedure is described to correct for this bias. After the correction is applied, the average agreement between the two methods of measurements is improved an order of magnitude, namely, from a former 2.0 percent to 0.17 percent."
"The attenuation constant for microstrip lines on fused quartz and their effective relative dielectric constant were measured and the results are discussed. The propagation losses in these lines proved to be smaller than those mentioned in the literature. The effective relative dielectric constant is found to be independent of frequency up to 12 GHz. The conductors were deposited without an adhesive layer but with sufficient adhesion for pressure bonding semiconductor chips."

"A relatively simple method is presented for analyzing coupled transmission-line networks by using network graphs and graph transformations. The network graph symbolism is easy to draw and to manipulate. All the graphs consist only of inductor, capacitor, and transformer symbols, and straight lines, which represent unit elements. The method of analysis is illustrated by several two-wire-line and multiwire-line examples. Also presented are several new useful transmission-line transformations and a graph equivalent for the general coupled transmission-line network. The graph-transformation method has four principal advantages: 1) explicit open-wire-line equivalent circuits of coupled line networks can be obtained relatively easily and without knowledge of network synthesis techniques; 2) the form of equivalent circuits can often be obtained without using any algebra; 3) at each step of the analysis, a positive-real network in graph form is available; consequently, in many analysis problems several equivalent circuits for the same network are derived; and 4) multiport networks are as easily dealt with as two-port networks."
"The characteristic impedance and phase velocity of a dielectric-supported air strip transmission line with side walls and with center conductors having zero thickness have been obtained by means of the variational method. Green's functions are used for setting up the variational expression. Using a 22-term expansion for the charge distribution on the center conductors, the Rayleigh-Ritz method is then applied in the calculation of the characteristic impedance and phase velocity of the strip transmission line. Design curves are presented and a correction factor is derived that can be applied when the thickness of the center conductors is not zero. The design curves are quite general and apply equally well to any isotropic dielectric material that is used as a support, regardless of its dielectric constant. The experimental data presented verifies the theoretical results."
"A new method is presented for calculating the charge and potential distribution in shielded microstrip lines with stratified dielectric fillings. The boundary value problem associated with this structure is formulated in a rigorous manner and the solution is constructed by an extension of the function-theoretic technique. Several advantages of this method are pointed out. The most important of these is its numerical efficiency. Numerical results are presented for charge and potential distributions for several choices of design parameters. The characteristic impedance and the guide wavelength are obtained from the knowledge of the charge distribution. Comparisons are made with the published data and the agreement is found to be very satisfactory."
"This paper describes a method of determining the junction parameters of an IMPATT device from basic microwave measurements through the use of a computer program. The technique, which evaluates the parasitic without the use of substituted impedances, and the computer program are described. Typical small and large signal results obtained on Ge and Si IMPATT devices are presented."
"Complex microwave conductivity of 9 /spl Omega/ /spl dot/ cm p-type silicon samples has been measured using conventional reflection and transmission bridges to examine their relative advantages and disadvantages. An attempt has been made to improve the reflection results from an analysis of the parameters of a circle diagram for reflection coefficient obtained on using a variable reactive termination after the semiconductor-filled waveguide section. In conformity with the calculated accuracy attainable from different types of measurement under the actual experimental condition, using commercial standards, the dielectric constant for the sample was found to be scattered over a region of /spl plusmn/0.4. It has been concluded that because of lack of accuracy in commercial standards for attenuation and phase shift, the potential accuracy of the conventional microwave methods falls too short of its mark to make any detinite conclusion about the effective mass of carriers in semiconductors at room temperatures."
"The problem of the junction of two rectangular waveguides partially filled with dielectric slabs is considered and a comparison with previously obtained results is carried out. A new and more approximate method is suggested and compared with the others."
"A radiometer using noise from a neon discharge tube to effect gain stabilization of a 13-cm maser radiometer is described. A balancing technique is used to make the output insensitive to gain and bandwidth fluctuations. The output does, however, depend on the total system noise temperature, and the technique is best suited to a receiver using a low-noise traveling wave maser, whose effective noise temperature is inherently stable."
"In some practical cases modified circular-package versions of parallel-coupled stripline fiIters might be more convenient than the conventional flat-package ones. This letter describes a design method for round-package interdigital, comb-line, or similar structures. The method is based on the conformal mapping of a flat filter into the desired configuration."

"A large-signal analysis of the high-frequency quenched-domain mode (Q-mode) of Gunn-effect devices has been developed. This is a phenomenological model and includes such effects as distinct domain formation and quenching processes, domain behavior in the presence of an RF voltage, displacement current, voltage dependence of the domain width, and others. The basis of the analysis is to obtain an instantaneous current-voltage transfer characteristic for the device and use it to generate the current waveform corresponding to a given periodic voltage waveform. The basic results of the large-signal analysis are then obtained from these current waveforms. The analysis reveals the distinguishing features of Q-mode oscillators. Admittance measurements on the oscillating device have been made and support the theoretical results for single-frequency operation. Applications of this analysis for investigating other nonlinear properties of these devices are suggested."
"The boundary value problem of a rectangular waveguide loaded with a thin slab of transversely magnetized semiconductor is solved with the help of a variational method. An electric field distribution showing strong nonreciprocal characteristics is obtained theoreticrdly, and is in good agreement with the experimental results performed with very thin slabs of n-InSb at room temperature."
"The theory of microwave transmission through thin-film screens of finite conductivity which contain circular, elliptical, and rectangular apertures and which are placed in the transverse plane of an X-band rectangular waveguide is developed. The theory is an extension of Bethe's work in which only screens with infinite conductivity were considered. Experimental verification of the theory is achieved by use of vacuum deposited thin-film screens, and the results are compared with the transmission properties of identical screens of thick foils of the same material. Significant differences are noted in the real and imaginary components of impedance presented by the thin-film and the foil screens with identical apertures. The finite conductivity of the screen is low enough to support an appreciable tangential component of electric field at the film surface."
"YIG filters covering the frequency ranges 12 to 18, 18 to 26, and 26 to 40 GHz have been designed and developed. The filters in the 18- to 40-GHz range were of three sections and achieved 80-MHz bandwidth and greater than 40 dB of higher order mode rejection. The filter in the 12- to 18-GHz region was of four sections utilizing staggered spheres in order to achieve a larger bandwidth filter with a minimum magnet gap. The bandwidth of this filter was 50 to 60 MHz with greater than 55 dB of higher order mode rejection. Useful information for the design of these filters was obtained with a special test fixture built to measure mutual coupling between spheres as a function of the angle between the line joining the sphere centers and the dc magnetic field. This data is reported for various iris sizes, shapes, and sphere spacings and indicates large differences in mutual coupling as the angle is varied from 0 to 90/spl deg/. The effect of various types of discontinuities and iris sizes and shapes on higher order mode excitation and coupling are discussed as well as constructional problems and the design of high field magnets from vanadium permendur."
"This paper presents the performance and normalized design parameters for a latching ring-and-post ferrite circulator in waveguide. A C-band circulator has provided an insertion loss of 0.35 dB and a 20-dB isolation bandwidth of 17 percent. When the circulator was matched for higher maximum isolation (50 dB) but narrower bandwidth (10 percent) at room temperature, the 20-dB isolation bandwidth was 7.8 percent across the -40/spl deg/ to +75/spl deg/C temperature range. Low-loss operation was obtained at pulsed powers up to 7.5 kilowatts, and at least 20 dB of isolation was maintained up to 100 kilowatts. This performance, in conjunction with a switching speed of a fraction of a microsecond, permits the use of these circulators for transmitting-receiving functions in high-reliability RADARs."
"This paper consists of two parts. In Part I, coupled-mode theory is employed to determine the effects of reflection at the various ports and unequal inductive and capacitive coupling coefficients on the coupling and directivity of two coupled lines. Since couplers utilizing microstrip lines generally have unequal inductive and capacitive coupling coefficients, the results presented here should be useful in explaining the behavior of microstrip coupled lines. It is shown how the difference in the coupling coefficients leads to finite directivity and, under certain conditions, to \"codirectional\" instead of \"contradirectional coupling.\" In Part II, the coupling coefficients and other parameters of various microstrip-line geometries are presented. Using these parameters in the results obtained here leads to an improved understanding of and design criteria for coupled microstrip lines."
"This part of the paper presents the parameters of coupled microstrip lines which are required in the equations and results derived in Part I for determining the characteristics of coupled lines. Several geometries are considered and the inductive and capacitive coupling coefficients, the effective dielectric constant, and the characteristic impedance for various dimensions of these geometries are presented."
"Summary form only given. Formulas for the Q-factor and the resonant-frequency shift of a perturbed reflectiontype cavity have been derived recently and presented in the above-mentioned paper [ibid., vol. MTT-17, pp. 339-344, June 1969]. For the assumption that the external Q-factor, Qext is the same for the unperturbed and the perturbed cavity, a quadratic equation (14) for the unloaded Q-factor has been formulated. It has been pointed out that two values of Q, are obtained which are, respectively, smaller and greater than Q0, the unloaded Q-factor of the unperturbed cavity. However, by inspection of (14) it may be seen that one of the roots of the quadratic equation is always equal to this Q0. The other root is Q1 which is given by a formula where Ω01, and Ω02 are the values of the tuning parameter at which the resonant curves of the reflection coefficients of the unperturbed and the perturbed cavity intersect. This result shows that there is no ambiguity in the evaluation of the Q-factor of cavities when no change of the external Q-factor, Qext occurs during perturbation."
"The above-mentioned paper by E.W. Sard [ibid., vol. MTT-16, pp. 849-860, October 1968] claims rigor in the procedure. Although Sard mentions the possibility of variable resistance in the varactor, he does not discuss completely the effects this might have on his analysis, and the commentor (N. Houlding) contends that the reason why \"(previously) losses in the external transformation circuitry must be either neglected or nonrigorously corrected for\" is that the assumption of constant resistance is not justified. The commentor thinks that the problems of circuit loss and variable resistance can not be attacked independently; and, in particular, that there is no justification for assuming the varactor will not contain loss terms which will simulate the behavior of losses in a matching network. The commentor believes it is misleading to imbed the varactor in a circuit which is not the minimum-loss form and to perform an analysis assuming that the varactor resistance is constant. Houlding's detailed argument is provided. In replying, the original author (Sard) states that subject to the assumed equivalent circuit described in his Fig. 1, he still believes the method described to be completely rigorous."
"The commentors (J.A. Saxton and J.A. Lane) have read the above paper [ibid., vol. MTT-16, pp. 938-943, November 1968] which makes extensive references to their earlier work. Several comments are provided. The method followed by Thompson, Silberberg, Gray, and Hardy (the authors of the above-named work), although identical in principle Saxton & Lane's free-wave method, incorporated several features of microwave measurement technique developed in recent years; whereas the original experiments were carried out in 1944 to 1945 with relatively simple equipment. The commentors agree that, with modern techniques, the free-wave method may with care be as accurate as the absorption-cell method for deriving reflection coefficients, and of course the former can provide data for rough surfaces. On the other hand, the cell technique requires a relatively small quantity of liquid which is a considerable advantage in that the temperature of the liquid can be varied rapidly and conveniently. In replying, the authors note that they believe that Saxton and Lane's sensitivity on this matter is due to the fact that they missed the basic point of our work which was, as clearly stated in our paper, to refine the freewave method to make it suitable for the precision measurements of reflectivities of roughened water surfaces. The authors have examined carefully Saxton and Lane's information, which includes their antenna patterns, and we must conclude that it is highly unlikely that the direct coupled component is significant in their experiment and, furthermore, that it is very likely that the standing wave between horns and target is in fact present in their system, given that our geometry was made to correspond as closely as possible to theirs. The authors note that in the commentors' paper, Saxton and Lane also express surprise that such a direct coupled component could exist in view of the observed radiation patterns of their antennas."
"The great difficulty in solving for the propagation constant and effective characteristic impedance for microstrip transmission lines is invariably avoided by assuming quasi-TEM propagation and solving Laplace's equation rather than the wave equation. Deschamps and Wu have qualitatively discussed aspects of the hybrid-mode problem. Zysman and Varon have presented a solution for the related but distinctly different problem of closed microstrip. In this communication we present the basis through which the quasi-TEM analysis may be justified for the limit cases of guided waves on microstrip in which the dielectric constant approaches that of free space or becomes very large. The guided wave problem is formulated exactly in terms of longitudinal electric and magnetic field components satisfying the wave equation and coupled through the boundary conditions at the dielectric interface."
"A millimeter wave down-converter was built utilizing adhesive-backed copper tape for the microstrip circuit construction. The down-converter incorporated an IMPATT diode local oscillator and a Schottky barrier mixer diode hybrid mounted in the circuit. The performance of the unit was two dB worse than its waveguide counterpart. Optimization of the individual circuit components should permit the performance of a microstrip down-converter to approach very closely that of its waveguide counterpart."
"Two quasi-optical components operating at 90 GHz which use the effects of a metal plate on total reflection are described. A circular polarizer and, with the addition of a metal plate grating, a device having properties similar to a tuned turnstile junction were constricted. Experimental results showed better than 99 percent polarization conversion for the polarizer."

"A general method is proposed for analyzing the transmission line characteristics of strip lines with rectangular outer conductor and multidielectric layers within a TEM wave approximation. This method uses Green's function for formulating the problem and a variational principle for obtaining practical solutions. The case of the microstrip line is first discussed, and numerical results are found to be consistent with other theories and experiments. The case of strip lines with a rectangular outer conductor and three dielectric layers is examined for various combinations of dielectric materials. Other applications of Green's function and the theoretical limitation of this method are also described."
"In this paper a plane-parallel, perfectly conducting, zero-thickness grating is analyzed by an integral equation procedure. This procedure generalizes the well-known single-mode method by taking multimode propagation into account. The grating is located in free space; viewed transversely to the plane of the structure, it is a zero-thickness shunt discontinuity in the free-space waveguide. The solution of the integral equation is obtained for E (or TM) mode excitation, when the spacing between conducting strips is small compared to a period, and it is interpreted in network terms. Finally, an explicit equivalent network is presented for the grating under multimode conditions."
"Two forms of quasi-optical filters are discussed herein for use at millimeter-wave frequencies and possibly for far infrared frequencies. One form consists of metallic grids with intervening dielectric support material which forms a quasi-optical filter analogous to the inductively coupled waveguide bandpass filter. Because of dielectric losses, the relatively weak upper stopband, and the rapidly repeating passbands, this type of structure leaves much to be desired as a bandpass quasi-optical filter. However, when designed for wide bandwidth, it makes a very good pseudo-high-pass filter. For moderate- to wide-band bandpass applications, pseudo-high-pass filters of this type can be designed to match with a form of quasi-optical low-pass filter previously treated by the authors, in order to give a bandpass filter with strong, broad stopbands on both sides of the passband. Design principles, computed performance, and experimental results are presented for both pseudo-high-pass and bandpass structures."
"It is pointed out that parallel-connected baluns (4:1 impedance transformation) have approximately four times the operating bandwidth of series-connected baluns (1:1 impedance transformation). The simple theory of uncompensated resonant baluns is discussed, and design curves are presented which may be used to design any balun of this type. Experimental results are given on one type of parallel-connected balun showing it capable of a 25:1 operating bandwidth as predicted by theory. Operating over this bandwidth, the balun is only /spl lambda/ / 25 in length at the lower band-edge frequency. Because of its 4:1 impedance transformation, the balun should be very useful in the feeding of frequency-independent antennas with high impedance, such as the conical spiral."
"The 1:1 balun constructed of a bifilar delay line and an inverse 1:1 transformer is analyzed for its input characteristics. As a main result of the analyses, the following results were obtained about the balun in this paper. 1) Resonance occurs when the line length is equal to n (any positive integer) times half of a wavelength of the unbalanced transmission mode. 2) The lower cutoff frequency is determined by electromagnetic coupling coefficient \"k/sub m/\" when L/sub sigma/ and /spl iota/ are constant. 3) The upper cutoff frequency is also given by a combination of k/sub m/ and k/sub e/, etc. 4) Shortening of the distance between the balun and the ground makes the resonant frequency lower when the balun has a magnetic core or when the electrostatic coupling coefficient \"k/sub e/\" becomes smaller and k/sub m/ is kept constant. /spl omega//sub OI/ becomes lower. 5) In order to realize a wide-band balun, /spl beta//sub b/ / /spl beta//sub u/ shouId be larger and and /spl beta//sub b/ / /spl omega/ should be kept constant."
"The following sections describe two techniques for interconnecting the input ports of microwave filters suitable for sorting signals into large numbers of contiguous frequency bands. Both techniques are capable of extension to very large numbers of channels, and both are believed to be new and useful. Both have been tested at microwave frequencies and give results in reasonable agreement with those predicted. One technique uses the impedance transforming property of a uniform transmission Iine to achieve the equivalent of the directional filter. It has proved especially valuable in the design of practical filters providing large numbers of channels in several microwave frequency bands. The other is based upon a width-tapered waveguide, which serves as a space-distributed high-pass filter."
"The performance of a two-idler parametric amplifer is compared with that of a single-idler amplifer with a broad-banding resonator at its input. Both circuits contain the same varactor and are pumped at the same frequency. For most of the cases considered the two-idler amplifier gives a somewhat narrower bandwidth, slightly higher noise temperature, but lower sensitivity to variation of m/sub 1/ (the pump modulation rate) than the single-idler amplifier. The comparison is made over a range of pump and varactor cutoff frequencies"
"Two frequency transformations are given which enable microwave filters to be realized with coupled lines and lumped capacitances from a characteristic prototype lumped network to a good approximation. The procedore includes filters originally proposed by Matthaei and CristaI, and enables realizations for large bandwidths. A number of examples demonstrate the efficiency of the procedures."
"A novel method for spectral analysis of nanosecond pulse-modulated microwave signals is presented. The technique is based on the dispersion of waveguide. It is applied to a case of microwave emission from InSb. The calibration procedure makes use of the modulating capability of the semiconductor samples themselves."
"Further results are presented obtained with experimental tests on an X-band model of Fabry resonator having mirrors with step or sloped rims. A periodical trend of the power losses per transit as a function of the step rim thickness for both positive and negative values of the thickness is noted. This behavior is observed also in the mode pattern configuration. An oscillating trend of the power losses versus slope angle with smoothing maxima and minima is also observed for the sloped rim resonator. The possibility of independent field control at each side of the mirrors has also been proved."
"The microwave limiter described in this correspondence is ideally reflectionless at all power Ievels. The matched limiter is achieved by simply adding a miniature 50-ohm rod resistor to a conventional dual-diode limiter. Although the resulting match is unilateral, it can be made bilateral by adding another diode-resistor combination. Response data of an S-band prototype unit illustrate its capabilities."

"A new approximation theory is presented for a low-pass prototype filter which simultaneously optimizes both the passband amplitude and phase response of the scattering transfer coefficient over the same finite band. This closed form solution is expressed in terms of single polynomial, which is readily generated through a simple recurrence formula, and has been termed the equidistant linear phase polynomial since its phase deviation from linearity vanishes at equidistant points along the real frequency axis. A synthesis procedure is presented for the realization of this transfer function using a resistively terminated, symmetrical, lossless, two-port network where extensive use is made of the immittance inverter concept. The even-mode admittance, which defines the network, possesses a simple closed form representation in terms of the equidistant linear phase polynomial and its derivative, and consequently, the entire theory is derived in an analytic form. Typical performance characteristics are graphically presented for networks of up to 14th degree, illustrating the superiority of this new approach over any other known form of approximation theory for selective linear phase filters."
"The design theory is presented for narrow-band generalized interdigital linear phase filters which consist of a pair of identical cross-coupled interdigital lines. The procedure for the determination of the characteristic admittances of the elements which describe the structure based upon the element values of the low-pass linear phase prototype network is given, from which the physical dimensions of the filter may readily be obtained. The measured performance characteristics of two filters are presented. The first is a 2.5 percent bandwidth 14-element filter based upon the maximally flat prototype operating in L-band, and the second is a 1 percent bandwidth 18-element version based upon the finite band prototype in S-band. Both filters are shown to be in excellent agreement with theory, with the latter exhibiting transfer characteristics considerably superior to those obtainable from any form of conventionally equalized filter of similar overall degree."
"A procedure is described whereby narrow-band waveguide generalized direct-coupled cavity linear phase filters may be designed from a low-pass prototype linear phase network. The structure is comprised of two identical conventional half-wave direct-coupled cavity filters with shunt inductive irises, cross coupled by small apertures in the narrow wall between adjacent cavities. Explicit formulas for the susceptances of the irises, the cross coupling apertures, and the electrical lengths of the cavities are given in terms of the element values of the low-pass prototype. Measured results on two X-band filters are given with fractional bandwidths of 0.15 percent and 0.85 percent. Both were designed upon the maximally flat prototype, the former being an 8-cavity filter while the latter is a 14-cavity version and illustrates the dispersion effect due to the frequency-dependence of the inductive irises."
"Integral equations are obtained for the currents induced on an infinite perfectly conducting grating by a plane wave. The integral equations are approximated by matrix equations which are readily solved for the currents. Once the currents are known one can obtain the strengths of the grating modes. Numerical results are obtained for specific cases which have been considered previously in some optical experiments by Madden and Strong. The theoretical results are consistent with the conservation of energy. However, there are discrepancies with the experimental results. An equivalent problem of reflections in a terminated waveguide is also considered and good agreement between theory and experiment is obtained. The technique is extendible to dielectric gratings."
"Design information for coplanar-waveguide directional couplers has been calculated using quasi-static zeroth-order approximations. Experimental results on a 10-dB directional coupler designed from these calculations have shown reasonably good agreement with predictions. The smaller difference in even- and odd-mode velocity in a coplanar-waveguide directional coupler leads to better directivity and better performance than a microstrip directional coupler."
"Any method used to measure the isolation provided by a ferrite component at high pulse powers must also consider the effect of possible distortion to the pulse shape owing to the nonlinear phenomena in ferrites. When such pulse shape distortion occurs, measurement methods based on average crystal current measurement or temperature rise in a calorimeter yield erroneous results. It is necessary that the method of measurement of isolation must be one which finds the difference between the maximum heights of the input and output pulses to the component irrespective of the pulse shape at the two ports."
"The effects of video detector saturation on the overall linearity of a radiometric receiver are analyzed. A simple model of the detector is used and the stochastic nature of the signals is allowed for. A useful design formuIa is derived."
"The numerical solution of boundary value problems for the Helmholtz equation by the point-matching method presupposes the legitimacy of a specific representation of the solution. A necessary and sufficient condition is given for its validity. Earlier arguments purporting to show that the representation is valid only for circular cylinders, or for cylinders possessing certain symmetries, are shown to be unsound."

"A discrete reflecting beam waveguide with parabolic cylindrical reflectors, proposed by M. Kamimura, is theoretically analyzed. Electric field elementary waves on the reflector and the exciting primary electric field from the launcher are represented in the elliptic cylindrical coordinate system, and boundary conditions on the reflector are introduced to derive simultaneous integral equations regarding the reflector current. By solving these integral equations approximately, the integral representation of the secondary electric field in the beam waveguide is obtained, and poles and residues of the integrand are calculated to obtain the propagation constant of the beam waveguide and beam waveguide modes. The beam waveguide mode reflected toward the transmitting side when an obstacle is placed in the beam waveguide is obtained."
"The new beam waveguide with parabolic cylindrical reflectors, analyzed in another paper, has been constructed and experimentally investigated. The measurement of the attenuation is in fairly good agreement with the theoretical attenuation constant if surface roughness and installation error of the reflector are taken into account. By the fundamental experiment for train RADAR application, with various obstacles placed inside this beam waveguide, it is shown that the measured reflection from metallic obstacles is in good agreement with theoretical calculations."
"Two-dimensional field equations are reduced to Fredholm integral equations of the second kind. The integral equations are solved by matrix methods. The convergence of the matrix solutions is discussed. The matrix methods are applied to calculating the cutoff wavenumbers of waveguides. A method of estimating the errors is proposed. A method of correcting the matrix solutions is described and applied to a field problem in which the boundary is large compared with the wavelength. It is pointed out that for the commonest method of solving integral equations numerically (the method of subsections), the accuracy depends strongly on the position in each subsection of the point to which the field is referred. The dependence of the error on position is examined quantitatively."
"Attenuation of millimeter wave energy through light-illuminated semiconductor panels is determined. The expressions for the attenuation are applied to cases of uniform circular light excitation and laser beam excitation of the panel. Families of curves are given for the attenuation as a function of ratio of distance from the center of excitation to the diffusion length of the semiconductor material. The effect of surface recombination velocities of semiconductor panels is also considered."
"It is shown that inattention to the limits of validity of a field expansion can lead to field matching along impermissible boundaries. Nevertheless the error may not show up in any obvious way, since the method amounts to an expansion in terms of an incomplete modal set. The \"diffusion\" of a discrete mode into a continuum takes place in a distance which may be of the order of a tenth of a wavelength or more, so that in fact fairly accurate numerical results can nevertheless ensue over quite a range of parameters. This would seem to be the case for some examples taken from the literature in which the analysis has apparently been undertaken on the assumption that the initial formulation was exact."
 "In a lens waveguide with a curved axis, light beams appreciably different in frequency split and take different paths due to the effect of chromatic aberration of lens. The deviation from a main beam can grow cumulatively through the curved lens waveguide. This effect knits permissible bandwidth to be transmitted without loss of beams. For bends having tilts and offsets at the connections to the straight waveguides, the deviation of the light beam from the guide axis due to the effect of chromatic aberration is derived. With random circular bends the bandwidth is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of bends and proportional to the average radius of curvature. For a normal design of the curved waveguide the allowable bandwidth is expected to be sufficiently broad for signal transmission, but it is narrow in the sense of optical frequency."
"The microwave properties of a slab of uniformly magnetized material filling the cross section of an infinite, lossless rectangular waveguide operating only in TE/sub NO/ modes are discussed analytically. The material is assumed to have a scalar permittivity and a permeability describable by a tensor of the Polder form. A dc magnetic field is applied normal to the broad wall of the waveguide. Two cases are treated in detail. 1) The slab is placed against a metal shorting wall. 2) The slab is placed with empty waveguide on each side. A general analytical solution is obtained for both cases. Numerical values are computed for MnF/sub 2/, an easy-axis antiferromagnet. The computed values for the second are compared with values calculated on the basis of a plane-wave approximation and with experimental data. Applications of the technique to experimental measurements are described."
"A generalized coupled-mode formulation is presented for propagation in nonuniform media, where the modes are those associated with both the discrete and continuous eigenvalue spectrum. The theory includes metallic and dielectric waveguide non-uniformities as special limiting cases. Analytic results are presented for a multimode linear tapered dielectric cylinder excited by the HE/sub 11/ mode."
"Fluorescent lamps were once used as standard noise sources for microwave measurements. Because of unpredictable noise output, they were abandoned in favor of pure-gas discharge tubes. It is shown that the unpredictability resulted from changes in Hg vapor pressure which were indirectly caused by cataphoretic pumping of the Hg ions. Data are presented which give excess noise as a function of discharge current and as a function of bulb temperature. These data were obtained for normal and abnormal lamps at 147 MHz."
"An infinite, lossless, rectangular waveguide semi-infinitely filled with a transversely magnetized magnetic material is discussed. With the limitation that only TE/sub no/ modes are incident, an analytic solution for the transmitted and reflected energies is presented. Numerical computations near resonance are presented both for a ferrite and an easy-axis antiferromagnet."
"Element value tables for optimum microwave bandstop filters consisting of quarter-wave spaced shunt open-circuited stubs are given. Both the stubs and the connecting unit elements contribute to the attenuation response. The tables give element values for 0.01dB, 0.10 dB, and 0.25 dB ripple Chebyshev designs with up to twenty-three elements, and for bandwidths between 30 percent and 150 percent."
"A closed form solution for the TE/sub lo/ mode in a rectangular waveguide partially filled with a linearly inhomogeneous dielectric is obtained. The dielectric is assumed to vary linearly in one transverse direction. The theory developed for the partially filled waveguide is extended to consider the characteristic equation of the completely filled waveguide with a linearly inhomogeneous dielectric. The phase velocity of the fields in the waveguide is studied by considering the /spl omega/ / /spl beta/ diagrams."
"Comparisons are made of the losses of two precision waveguide sections that were calibrated by three independent attenuation measurement methods. The loss measurement systems involved were the 1) dual-channel system which uses thermistors and a dc potentiometer test set, 2) dual-channel system which uses barretters and an ac ratio transformer test set, and 3) Nationaf Bureau of Standards reflectometer system which utilizes a quarter-wave short circuit and an IF attenuation standard. Loss values of about 0.05 dB, as calibrated by the three independent methods, typically agreed to within 0.0006 dB. It is believed that the results of these calibrations are representative of the best that can be achieved with current state-of-the-art techniques and available instrumentation for low-loss waveguide measurements."
"A single-tuned parametric amplifier was experimentally demonstrated at 18 GHz. A coaxial signal circuit and a radial idler cavity were used to obtain a large voltage-gain bandwidth product of 1440 MHz and a low noise temperature of 245/spl deg/K including the circulator loss contribution."
"A simple method for making real-time measurements of complex reflection coefficient p/sub x/ is described. The technique uses a hybrid tee and two crystal detectors to provide analog outputs from which the reflection coefficient is obtained. Sample measurements of p/sub x/ made at 34.3 GHz are presented which indicate a precision of greater than 0.02 units and 0.05 radians in magnitude and argument, respectively, for 0.1 /spl les/|p/sub x/|/spl les/ 1.0."

"A simple formula is derived for calculating the amplitude of the field that is due to an elemental radiator which radiates into a particular waveguide mode. The method used is based on rather elementary principles, and appeals readily to physical intuition. In this technique, the field radiated into an infinite-length waveguide is obtained from the expression for the field developed by the radiator in a traveling wave resonator formed of this waveguide, where this expression is found by use of the Poynting theorem. While derived for the electromagnetic system, the method and formula can be applied to other waveguide systems, such as mechanical, mixed, or others. Several examples are given to illustrate the use of the method."
"A device is described which performs the operation of correlation at microwave frequencies (L-band). Signal delay is provided by two transmission mode yttrium-iron-garnet delay lines magnetically biased for magnetoelastic wave propagation. Variation of delay is effected by electronically changing the magnetic bias on each delay line. Because group and phase delay are different functions of applied magnetic field, the autocorrelation function obtained for band-limited signals exhibits a sidelobe structure dependent on group delay variation and a fine structure which depends on phase delay variation. Calculations and experimental results are given for a sinusoidally frequency-modulated signal of large modulation index. This signal has a power spectrum with sharply defined frequency limits, easily variable bandwidth, and provides an autocorrelation function with a zero-order Bessel function amplitude variation."
"The possibility that a radially nonuniform dielectric might enhance the propagation characteristics of a surface wave line is discussed in terms of the axial cylindrical surface wave on a cylindrical structure. Attention is given to the field structure in the dielectric to determine the effect of the nonuniformity on the dielectric loss. Conclusions are deferred, however, until the change in surface impedance is also examined, since it essentially determines conductor loss and decay coefficient. The surface impedance is examined using the radial transmission line formalism of Marcuvitz. The modified field structure in the nonuniform dielectric and the concomitant change in dielectric loss is found to be most important for the surface wave structure; the nonuniformity changes the surface impedance only slightly since it is already highly reactive."
"A finite-difference Green's function method for solving time-harmonic wave guide scattering problems involving metallic obstacles of finite size by computer is described. The method is applied to the two-dimensional problem of a TE/sub 10/ mode impinging on cylindrical metallic posts of arbitrary shape in a rectangular waveguide. The equivalent susceptance of a transverse semidiaphragm computed using a 50 point approximation for the induced current distribution is found to be 1.5 percent less than the exact value. The S matrix of a thin bent window versus wavelength is also presented."
"The theory of modal expansions in an ideal cavity, in the presence of low-frequency current and charge distributions, is developed using the scalar and dyadic Green's functions. The case of a vertical antenna in a rectangular cavity is solved in detail, and the need for irrotational as well as solenoidal eigenvectors in the solution is established. The solutions are obtained in double-sum form, achieving an important computational advantage. Finally, the theory is checked against experimentally measured field distributions, obtaining excellent agreement and shedding light onto the unique behavior of the fields inside a cavity at frequencies below the first resonance."
"The radiation characteristics of 360/spl deg/ circumferential slots in rigid dielectric-coated coaxial cable are studied both theoretically and experimentally. The ultimate aim of this work is to use an array of such slots to launch a surface wave on the Goubau line formed by the outer conductor of the coaxial cable and the concentric dielectric coating. The possible advantage of this method over that of the flared horn is that the launching efficiency is controlled by the length of the launchlng section and is relatively independent its cross-sectional area."
"For propagation in lossless waveguide, the rigorous impulse response function is given. It is shown that its instantaneous frequency is that which has reached the output at that time by propagating at the group velocity. For a square envelope pulse with a carrier frequency /spl omega/ above the cutoff frequency /spl omega//sub c/, the propagation of the envelope and of the phase are essentially described by the group and phase velocity, respectively. In addition, however, the bulk of the pulse is preceded by the so-called Sommerfeld precursors having an increasing amplitude and a frequency which decreases from a high value to /spl omega/. Similarly the bulk of the pulse k followed by the Sommerfeld postcursors in which both amplitude and frequency decrease, the latter from /spl omega/ to /spl omega//sub c/. The analytic results are illustrated by computed examples of waveguide transients."
"The problem of electromagnetic wave propagation in a rectangular waveguide containing anisotropic slabs was considered by several authors. Their treatments, however, only cover particular cases (lossless media, TE/sub m0/ modes); they do not provide all the information required for the design of microwave devices such as ferrite isolators, which are still developed by empirical methods. The treatment presented here brings closer together the basic theory and the actual design work. A rectangular waveguide having any number of linear anisotropic and isotropic Iossy slabs extending across it, is considered. It is shown that an exact solution for the fields of all the modes can be obtained when the material properties meet certain requirements. A matrix formalism is used to derive the dispersion relations, which are then solved with the help of a computer program. Experimental results show good agreement with the computed values."
"An approximate technique for eigenvalue equations, the variation-iteration method, is commonly used in theoretical physics. Through an adequate numerical treatment it reduces to the inverse iteration method. It is shown here that this technique is most promising. Starting from an initial trial function, iterates are calculated, in which the components relative to the unwanted true eigenfunctions are eliminated. Both an upper and a lower bound of the unknown eigenvalues are calculated. This leads to an approbate eigenvalue within a specified accuracy with respect to the exact (unknown) eigenvalue. An extrapolation technique further accelerates the convergence. The computation time is shorter than when using the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure. The method is applied here to the dielectric-slab loaded waveguide, because the exact solution is available to check the validity of the method. The influence of the geometry, the dielectric constant, and the frequency is evaluated."
"Theory and experimental results are presented to show the possibility of using a resonant post technique for characterizing dielectric and magnetic materials at microwave frequencies. Results of the temperature dependence of the relative dielectric constant of nonmagnetic materials with /spl epsilon//sub r/, varying from 4 to 60 are presented and also loss tangent measurements at room temperature. The complex permittivity and permeability of a number of garnet materials has also been measured with 4/spl pi//spl gamma/M/sub s/ / /spl omega/ varying from 0.25 to 0.8. The measured real part of the permeability is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of Schlomann and the imaginary part of the permeability agrees with measurements by Green et al. on similar materials."
"The distraction of a plane light wave incident obliquely upon an isotropic dielectric layer traversed Iongitudinally by an acoustic microwave is examined by means of a guided-wave approach. In addition to a considerable amount of physical insight, this approach provides a wide range of techniques that have already been developed extensively in the area of electromagnetic microwaves. As a consequence, available methods can be used to explain and express known aspects of the diffracted light in terms of simple guided-wave concepts which are applied herein to derive results that have not been available. It is shown that the diffracted field within the dielectric layer, as well as in the exterior (air) medium, can be described by means of two alternative modal representations: 1) a description in terms of characteristic modes which progress independentiy of each other, and 2) a description in terms of coupled modes which interact with each other in the presence of the acoustic wave. While the two representations are equivalent, each has its own advantages and both are discussed in detail. It is also shown that these representations lead to equivalent networks that maybe utilized to account for boundary conditions and for other features of the scattered field. In particular, diffraction phenomena in a Bragg regime are carefuly investigated; qualitative and quantitative results are presented for situations wherein the orientation of the optic-acoustic interaction occurs at a Bragg angle of arbitrary order."
"Two pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) methods by a high-efficiency frequency multiplier with varactor diodes are compared. Typical results achieved for an X-band to Q-band tripler prove that the direct PAM is better than the indirect one under the same conditions. The former acts as a pulse shaper (PS), and has an output rise time smaller than the rise time of the output voltage of the modulator chain."
"A criterion is presented for establishing the required degree of isolation between injection-locked microwave oscillators to prevent reverse Iocking. In particular, the effect of circulator directivity and oscillator harmonics on the performance of the locking circuit is discussed. The injection-locked performance of pulsed and CW transferred electron oscillators is used as an example."
"An open-type X-band resonator was constructed of two cylindrical reflectors with crossed axes, separated by half the radius of curvature. The diffraction loss of this structure was found to be several orders of magnitude less than when the axes of the cylinders were made parallel, while the otherwise equivalent flat-flat resonator had the highest loss of all. A formula for the resonant frequencies of spherical confocal resonators, suitably modified, was found to predict the lowest mode resonances of the crossed-cylinder resonator with good accnracy."
"This correspondence describes a perturbation technique for obtaining the spinwave linewidth of polycrystalline garnet spheres with large values of /spl Delta/H/sub k/. Conventions waveguide cavity techniques require power levels in the kilowatt region to excite the parallel-pump instability. By using a dielectric resonator, large RF magnetic field intensities can be generated using relatively low-power levels, and the presently available low-loss dielectric materials enable high Q-values to be attained in the resonator. Since the sensitivity of cavity perturbation techniques depend on high Q-values, the ferrite sphere can be made small enough so that perturbation assumptions apply. Results are presented for some representative polycrystalline samples. The largest spinwave linewidth measurement required a RF magnetic field intensity of approximately 27.0 Oe."

"This paper gives the theory of spinwave instability under parallel pumping in hexagonal Zn/sub 2/Y ferrites with planar anisotropy in the case of a sphere. The configuration considered in this paper is the one in which the dc field makes an angle /spl beta/ with the easy plane and the resultant magnetization lies at an angle /spl alpha/ to it. To obtain parallel pumping with this arrangement it is necessfly to align the RF field along the magnetization. This leads to a new spinwave spectrometer which allows the dependence of the spinwave linewidth upon the angle /spl alpha/ which the unstable spinwave makes with the c axis of the crystal to be determined. The experimental results obtained on two Mn-Zn/sub 2/Y single-crystal ferrite spheres show that the spinwave linewidth increases with the angle /spl alpha/."
"To date an enormous amount of work has been done in the field off ferrite-junction circulators, but as yet no up-to-date bibliography is available. The present bibliography has been compiled to cover the period from January 1956 to September 1969 in order to help researchers working in this field. The bibliography provides references on ferrite circulators including entries for theory, stripline and waveguide versions, low and high powers, low-temperature circulators, lumped-element circulators, switching circulators, slot circulators, microstrip circulators, etc. It also includes references for typical designs and constructions as well as for experimental results and applications. As in the compilation of any bibliography, some valuable and pertinent article may have been overlooked."
"Synthesis techniques are presented for realizing arbitrary transmission-line reactance functions in four common forms of arrays of coupled lines, together with minor variations of these forms. These are two types of interdigital lines and dual forms of half-wave parallel-coupled lines. Design examples are presented for each form of coupled-line network and variations. Although the synthesis procedures are developed from the point of view of applications to equalizers, the procedures are completely general."
"A computer-aided design approach is developed for the analysis and design of broad-band amplifiers with complex terminations, e.g., an antenna. The transfer scattering parameters are used for the analysis of a cascade connection of distributed lines and amplifiers. A modified version of Rosenbrock's minimization procedure is used to find the optimum lengths and characteristic impedances of the lines which minimize the reflection losses and realize a desired gain characteristic. Several examples are given."
"The propagation of electromagnetic waves in a hollow perfectly conducting pipe with an elliptical cross section and the results of numerical calculations of the cutoff wavelength of nineteen successive modes are presented. Some inaccuracies in the usual mode classification are proven and corrected. As a large number of numerical calculations are required to determine the cutoff wavelength for a single set of dimensions and a single mode, approximate formulas for the eight lowest order modes are suggested. These formulas are of a simple algebraic form and give a relative error smaller than 0.25 percent. With the exact succession of the different modes it becomes possible to compare the bandwidth of an elliptical waveguide to the bandwidth of the rectangular and circular guide. The measured values of the cutoff wavelength of different modes agree very well with the theoretical calculated values."
"To promote the development and understanding of microwave magnetic devices, especially in the millimeter and submillimeter range utilizing quasi-optical techniques, a discussion of propagation and polarization of plane waves and narrow rays in gyromagnetic media in an arbitrary direction is considered. It is assumed that the medium can be described by a permeability tensor of the Polder type. The approach is structured after classical crystal optics but yields significantly different results since each of the two permitted rays is elliptically polarized. The ellipticities are derived. The phase surfaces are discussed for the lossless case. There are no optical axes but ranges of forbidden directions exist for one or both rays. D, B, and the wave vector n form an orthogonal set at all times. H is confined to the B, n plane; it gyrates along an ellipse such that the Poynting vector traces in time an elliptical cone which contains the wave vector as one mantle line. Therefore, a narrow ray can be understood to proceed along a helical path."
"The properties of the axially symmetric normal modes of a circular waveguide containing an axially magnetized gas or solid-state plasma (i.e., the so-called Faraday configuration) are examined. Of particular interest is the fact that transverse electric fields demonstrate a characteristic twisting wave motion rather than the more familiar rotating motion of the circularly polarized TE/spl deg//sub 11/ limit modes or the undulating motion of the normal modes of an empty waveguide. Modes demonstrating this unique wave motion are termed \"twist\" modes. Within a restricted range of magnetic field, twist modes divide into evanescent (TE-limit) modes and low-loss propagating (TM-limit) modes. Since wavelengths of propagating modes depend on the axial B field, twist modes in solid-state magnetoplasmas such as InSb may find applications in magnetically tunable millimeter and submillimeter devices."
"An experimental and theoretical investigation of the propagation of axially symmetric (\"twist\") modes in an axially magnetized sample of indium antimonide is described. Measurements of the TE/spl deg//sub 01/-mode reflection coefficient are shown to agree well with computer calculations based upon a convergent multimode analysis. Observed maxima and minima are seen to correspond to dimensional resonances and antiresonances of the two lowest order twist modes. These results are qualitatively explained in terms of twist mode standing waves. Under certain conditions of magnetic field and sample thickness, energy conversion from the TE/spl deg//sub 01/ mode to the TM/spl deg//sub 01/ mode occurs. This conversion has a maximum calculated efficiency of 95 percent under the conditions of the present experiment."
"A method is described whereby the coupling value of a TEM quarter-wave coupler can be continuously varied over ranges up to 100 percent of the nominal value. The method employs the change of even- and odd-mode characteristic impedance levels over the coupling region and as such is best suited to stripline and other configurations which use parallel ground planes as outer conductors. Because current lines are crossed only in regions of relatively low current densities and because physical realizations are mechanically simple and compact, reliability is assured. Its major disadvantage is that the voltage standing-wave ratio (VSWR) increases and the isolation decreases as the coupling is tuned away from the nominal value. However, the simple predesign procedures described in Section III can reduce or eliminate this problem. The device can be used as a variable attenuator, a variable sampler, and, in systems with couplers, a trimming device."
"Ray-optical techniques presented previously by the authors for study of mode propagation in homogeneously filled waveguides are extended to accommodate multilayered regions and regions capable of supporting multiple wave species. Emphasis is placed on a self-consistent ray treatment which illustrates alternative methods for dealing with ray coupling at boundaries and with the presence of multiple wave types, either in a single layer or in adjacent regions. Both closed and open structures are analyzed, with discussion of the latter limited to modes with small leakage due either to duct inhomogeneities or to curvature. Examples include layered dielectric waveguides with a straight or circular axis, and compressible plasma waveguides which are illustrative of media wherein two wave species (electromagnetic and electroacoustic) can propagate."
"Earnshaw's theorem, a characterization of potential functions equivalent to Poisson's equation, expresses a relation between the value of the potential at a point and an average of the function over a spherical surface centered at the point. The theorem therefore lends itself to use in numerical computation of the potential. A formulation of the theorem is presented with particular reference to determination of the potential in a region which is inhomogeneously occupied by dielectric media. This provides a rigorous basis for the formulas used to determine the potential at points on a dielectric interface, in that it avoids the ambiguity which arises in the evaluation of the finite-difference approximation to the Laplacian at such points. The use of the formulation is illustrated by examples of computer-generated graphs giving the potential in the presence of irregular dielectric objects."
"The effect of placing evaporated electrodes on the surface of thin-film microwave acoustic transducers is studied. In particular, it is found that the top electrode produces frequencies of infinite conversion loss (poles) within the usual operating passband of the transducer. The theory of thin-film microwave acoustic transducers is reviewed and utilized to find an analytic solution for the pole frequencies versus thickness of the top electrode. Theoretics results for Au, Ag, and Al top electrodes deposited on thin films of CdS and ZnO are presented. Experimental results for (Au/CdS), (Ag/ZnO), and (A1/ZnO) transducers are obtained by means of a novel swept-frequency pulse-echo method of measuring conversion loss. The theoretical and experimental results are found to agree within five percent. The relative advantages of transducers with the (Au/ZnO) and (A1/ZnO) configurations are compared, and designs for octave bandwidth operation are given for center frequencies ranging from 1.5 to 10 GHz."
"The total loss of the HE/sub 11/ mode to the radiation field of a finite dielectric rod with small amplitude surface irregularities is considered, and a simple approximate analytic expression for radiation due to sinusoidal roughness is presented. It is shown that radiation occurs only when the frequency of surface roughness /spl Omega/ is in the range /spl beta/-k/sub 2/</spl Omega/</spl beta/+k/sub 2/ where /spl beta/ is the modal propagation constant and k/sub 2/ is the wavenumber of the surrounding medium. An analysis of isolated irregularities and a linear taper with a small change in radius are also presented."
"An effective method for computing the transient response of an n-conductor transmission line system, which is characterized by multiple propagation modes of unequal phase velocities, is presented. To derive the computational algorithm, an equivalent circuit consisting of n decoupled transmission lines in conjunction with two congruence transformers was constructed and converted into two disjointed resistive n-ports. It is shown that the electrical behavior of the coupled transmission lines can be completely described in terms of the static capacitance matrices of the conductor system. The experimental results obtained on a three-conductor microstrip-printed circuit were found to be in excellent agreement with the computed results"
"A general solution to the problem of determining first the aperture field distribution and then the transmission and reflection coefficients of an infinite planar conducting sheet perforated periodically with apertures has been formulated. The excitation is considered to be a plane wave incident at any arbitrary angle. The aperture dimensions and array element spacings were assumed to be comparable with the wavelength of the incident electromagnetic field. The solution given can include the effect of a dielectric slab used to support the thin conducting sheet. The solution is obtained by matching the tangential field components at the surface of the screen. The resulting integral equation is solved by the method of moments which reduces the integral equation to a system of linear algebraic equations that can be solved with the use of a digital computer. Accurate results for both the magnitude and phase of the aperture field distribution and the transmission coefficients for the propagating modes are determined explicitly for a specific example of slots arranged in an equilateral triangular lattice. The balance of power flow between the reflected and the transmitted waves has been checked with satisfactory results. The solution can be applied to the problem of scattering from a conducting screen with periodic apertures and to the complementary problem of scattering from a set of conducting plates by the use of Babinet's principle."
"Tables are presented for the design of asymmetric nonuniform-coupled transmission-line directional couplers, having a high-pass Chebyshev equal-ripple coupling response. The coefficients of the continuously tapered coupling factor represented as a polynomial of sixth order are tabulated for mean couplings of -3, -6, -8.34, -10, and -20 dB and for a given ripple of the high-pass coupling response."
"A technique for the measurement of package parasitic and equivalent-circuit parameters of microwave semiconductor devices at the frequency of operation is presented. In this method a two-port coupling circuit is found which transforms the impedance measured in rectangular waveguide to the terminals of the equivalent circuit used to represent the semiconductor device. This approach combines known properties of radial transmission lines and of impedance measurement in the TE/sub 10/-mode full-height waveguide to obtain an analytical referencing technique for a diode mounted across a reduced-height waveguide. Application of this technique is illustrated by measurements of several varactor diodes."
"It has been shown that when the reactance at the electrical port of an interdigital surface-wave transducer is tuned out, near-perfect reflection of acoustic surface waves can be obtained at either acoustic port. An inverted common-collector (ICC) transistor circuit can be used to accomplish this tuning and simultaneously generate a negative resistance that can be used to provide reflection and transmission gain for the surface waves. Some theoretical and experimental results for such a situation in the case of surface waves propagating in the Z direction on Y-cut LiNbO/sub 3/ are presented. In particular, electrically controlled variable (digital) time delay has been demonstrated using this technique."
  "Boundary conditions describing perfectly conducting surfaces are developed for the four-component vector potential. The boundary conditions are nonunique and are shown to depend on the choice of the gauge. A physical interpretation is developed for the nonunique property. The results shown herein provide boundary conditions for the development of a computer approach to field problems in terms of the four-component vector potential."
"A very simple asymptotic solution to the eigenvalue equation of electromagnetic and acoustic surface waveguides is derived and shown to be accurate except where the mode has cutoff characteristics. The form of the solution is the same for both circular and planar geometries."
"The theory and design of a broad-band microwave frequency translator using diode-switched coupled-line phase shifters is discussed. Results indicate spurious sideband suppression greater than 30 dB out to the 30th harmonic of the translation frequency."
"An investigation of the limiting threshold in a subsidiary-resonance Iimiter was conducted. Particular attention was given to the effects of the demagnetizing factors on the limiting threshold. Demagnetization factors of 1/2 for N/sub x/ and N/sub y/, and O for N/sub z/ made it possible to achieve thresholds an order of magnitude lower than had been obtained previously. The above demagnetizing factors correspond to a long thin rod magnetized along the axis of symmetry. A limiter, utilizing alternate polycrystalline YIG rods and dielectric rods of the same dimensions for dynamic range, and alternate single-crystal YIG and dielectric rods for reduced threshold, was developed. The dielectric rods provided magnetic insulation for the ferrite material such that each ferrite rod was biased independently in order to maintain the proper demagnetizing factors. The final limiter had a threshold of 2.8 watts peak power and a dynamic range of 30 dB."
"A waveguide rotary joint for operation in the frequency range 28-31 GHz is described. The construction of the joint is simple, as the symmetrical excitation employed for mode conversion obviates the need for mode filters. The joint may be used without tuning at certain optimum frequencies such that insertion loss is always better than 1 dB. The joint may be tuned for operation at any required frequency within the band."
"Experimental results presented in a recent paper by Ishii and Jenners tend to show that the transmission through a reentrant hybrid tee is nonreciprocal. The derivation presented here shows that the device is always reciprocal, and that the particular effect noted in the paper under discussion was due to mismatches."
"The propagation of beams in optical waveguide is presented in a manner that allows beam trajectories and mode parameters to be calculated using the classical transmission-line equations. Transmission-line impedance-matching techniques are applied to mode matching in optical systems."
"The homodyne detection principle is applied to the measurement of microwave reflection coefficients. The system described is considerably more sensitive than video detection, is linear over a wide dynamic range, and allows simultaneous phase and amplitude measurements, with phase measurements amplitude insensitive. Two channels are used, one being amplitude modulated."
"The development of an X-band waveguide frequency discriminator is discussed. It is quite versatile and quite simple in construction. The mid-frequency of the desired bandwidth can be conveniently changed by easily changing the additional line length. Furthermore, the sensitivity, defined as change in the output power ratio per unit change in frequency, can also be conveniently varied by varying the additional line length. Higher sensitivity would result in a smaller bandwidth for a certain value of P/sub 2/ / P/sub 1/ depending upon the accuracy with which the power/power ratio can be measured."
"The described variable attenuator utilizes p-i-n diodes and three-port hybrids. Two arrangements of the diodes are investigated. The corresponding attenuators have basically different performances. An experimental device was built in stripline technique and a measured attenuation variable from 0 to 28 dB over the entire X-band was obtained."
"An inequality |S/sub 22/| is< or =1-(|S/sub 21/|/sup 2/ / |(1+\\ S/sub 11/ | )) is derived to simplify automatic testing of passive, reciprocal microwave two-ports."
"A concise and careful review of the Elliott analysis of how a pulsed carrier wave is distorted after propagating down a waveguide is given. This review, in conjunction with the more recent work of Haskell and Case, derives the time region for which the Elliott (corrected) solution is valid. It is shown that if the pulse contains a sufficient number of carrier cycles, and if the guide is long enough compared to a free-space wavelength at the carrier frequency, then the Elliott solution is valid for practically all times."

"An integrative graphical method of designing a broadband TEM-mode power divider of N output ports is presented. Each branch of the divider's circuit consists of cascaded transmission-line segments, and the corresponding segments of each branch are connected by resistors to a common junction. These resistors absorb the reflected signals due to mismatch at any of the output ports; they are therefore isolated from one another. The symmetry of this circuit permits the use of the method of even- and odd-mode excitations at the output ports. It was found that the even-mode circuit is the same as for a stepped-impedance transformer, which is well known. The odd-mode circuit lends itself to the determination of the isolation resistors using the iterative graphical procedure on a Smith chart. Numerical values of the isolation conductance for dividers of bandwidths up to 10:1, the maximum input VSWR, and the minimum isolation among the output ports are given."
"A rectangular carrier pulse is studied under the assumption of the propagation of a pure basic mode in a circular waveguide with low wall losses. An analytical expression of the electromagnetic field of an output pulse and an analytical expression of, the velocity with which the temporal center of gravity of the axial component of the Poynting vector of a pulse is traveling in a waveguide were derived for a not very high ratio of the input-pulse carrier frequency to the cutoff frequency of the given mode. A dependence is found of the above velocity on the wall losses, on the distance from the source, and on the duration time of the input pulse. The relation is found between the above velocity and the instantaneous phase velocity in the above center of gravity. The results obtained can be of importance in nanosecond pulse technique or for long-distance transfer of the pulses."
"A numerical-calculation method for rectangular waveguides containing a transversely inhomogeneous dielectric is presented. The method is not restricted to the cutoff case or to special inhomogeneities. The relative permittivity of the dielectric can be an arbitrary function of the cross-sectional coordinates. The electric-and magnetic-field strengths, the dispersion characteristics of the propagating modes, and the attenuation constants of the evanescent modes result from the solution of a matrix eigenvalue problem with typically 8000 matrix elements. Propagating and evanescent modes in a waveguide containing a longitudinal semicircular dielectric rod are calculated as examples. The accuracy of the calculation method is confirmed by measurements and by calculating a special example with an exactly known solution. The error of the field intensities is typically 5 percent; the error of the dispersion characteristics and of the attenuation constants is typically 0.5 percent."
"The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic procedure for the adjustment of the m-port single-junction circulator in terms of the scattering-matrix eigenvalues of the junction. The theory used starts by defining the initial location of the scattering-matrix eigenvalues before any adjustment to the junction is made and also by defining the eigenvalue arrangement of an ideal circulator. The initial set of eigenvalues is then perturbed in a systematic way by adjusting the phases of (m-1) of the eigenvalues one at a time until the final set of eigenvalues is obtained. This procedure leads to (m-1) distinct scattering matrices which can be obtained with (m-1) symmetric perturbations of the junction. This approach also leads to (m-1) distinct boundary-value problems each involving one independent variable instead of the more usual single-boundary problem involving (m-1) independent variables."
"The noise properties of amplifiers and oscillators are critical in systems applications. This paper describes a system for the measurement of AM noise in amplifiers and oscillators pulsed on for durations on the order of a microsecond or less. Such a system is useful in measuring AM noise in pulsed solid-state microwave devices such as avalanche- and Gunn-diode simplifiers and oscillators, where heat-dissipation limitations sometimes make continuous operation impossible."
"By refining the technique and analysis of an earlier paper, it is shown that a compensation method is the basis of the most precise measurement of noise temperature, especially for cryogenic noise generators. The measurement system is adjusted so that it is in thermal equilibrium with the generator under test. As is typical for the compensation method, the generator under test may be mismatched, and the comparison errors and detector limitations can be verified experimentally. For generators with small reflection coefficients (|/spl Gamma/|is<or =0.1), the comparison error is very close to the theoretical minimum, namely, twice the system resolution. For reflection coefficients as large as 0.5, the comparison error increases in a typical system to about four times the system resolution."
"A formulation is presented for the determination of variational bounds on the even and odd phase shifts that characterize the scattering of electromagnetic waves by symmetric dielectric obtacles in waveguides. The formulation is an extension of a technique recently developed in quantum mechanical scattering theory for the determination of variations bounds on partial-wave phase shifts for scattering by systems with internal degrees of freedom. As opposed to the usual variational principles which give values that may be below or above the true values, the formalism presented here gives results that are variational and represent rigorous bounds on the true values. The formulation is presented for a more general case, but for simplicity the method is applied to scattering from dielectric obstacles in a rectangular waveguide in which only the TE/sub 10/ mode is propagated. The method involves the use of a trial function orthogonal to the lowest mode with variational parameters and the introduction of a Green's function for a simplified problem in which the higher modes cannot be excited. Calculated values are presented for the phase shifts for the true problem and also for the series and shunt reactance of the equivalent network. The principle can be generalized to multimode waveguide problems."
"A Fourier-transform method is used for determining the frequency dependence of the transmission parameters for coupled micro strip lines. Experimental measurements of the even- and odd-mode velocities are described for substrates made of dielectric as well as demagnetized ferrite. The results show a significant difference in the amount of dispersion of the two normal modes of propagation."
"A delay line is described which uses longitudinal-to-shear wave conversion to achieve low acoustic loss in YAG with CdS transducers. This device provides 4 /spl mu/s of delay at 5 GHz with a 6-dB bandwidth of ~1.3 GHz and an insertion loss of ~65 dB."

"By using slope information obtained from Getsinger's or Gupta's charts, it is possible to calculate incidental loss in TEM coupled-line sections using the equation for /spl alpha//sub cc/ given in this correspondence. This value of loss factor can then be used to calculate incidental loss in components that include coupled-line sections for which Z/sub 0//sup 2/ = Z/sub 0e/Z/sub 0o/, such as 90/spl deg/ backward-wave couplers and microwave C sections. An example calculation is given for a single-section 90/spl deg/ coupler."
"A method is presented for finding, by inspection, the system function (i.e., the Laplace transform of the impulse response) of a cascade connection of equal-length TEM-mode transmission lines."
"A matrix formulation is given for the classical Taylor's series method of approximating differential operators by finite differences. This formulation lends itself to digital computation, so that automatic generation of finite-difference formulas becomes possible. A program to perform this task has been written and tested, with good results for those operators of particular interest in microwave theory (Laplace's, Helmholtz's, and related types). Following a brief description of the program, its use is illustrated for the case of the scalar axisymmetric Laplacian. It is concluded that a wide variety of special finite-difference operators such as recently devised for specific microwave problems can now be generated automatically."
"It is shown that a three-port stripline circulator can be constructed to operate in Z-band at 15/spl deg/K with 0.5 dB insertion loss and up to 20-percent bandwidth for the 20-dB isolation."

 "After more than five years of intensive research and development, avalanche diodes and transferred electron devices are established as useful and reliable microwave power generators. They have recently been employed increasingly in both military and commercial systems. Many manufacturers now have production capabilities for these devices, and fabrication technology has reached a sophisticated level. Volume production at relatively low cost is now feasible. Avalanche diodes and transferred electron devices now compete favorably on a cost and performance basis with vacuum tubes and solid-state harmonic generators in a wide variety of power-generation applications."
"The basic principles and characteristics of the various modes of operation of avalanche transit-time devices are presented. Theoretical and experimental results are also presented in order to indicate the present state of development and the kind of performance which has been achieved in these devices."
"The current status of transferred electron devices (TEDs) is surveyed. The physics of the transferred electron effect, the theory of amplifiers and oscillators, material growth, device fabrication, and the design of amplifier and oscillator circuits are discussed along with a presentation of the outlook for the near future."
"A method has been developed for the direct broad-band measurement of the impedance of a Gunn diode operating at a bias voltage exceeding threshold. This method is based upon determination of an equivalent-circuit model for the diode mount and package, which is found to be valid over the 1- to 20-GHz range. Using this circuit, the low-field diode equivalent circuit is found and takes the form of a parallel RC circuit as expected from the theory. An unusual result is that the low-field capacitance is found to be strongly dependent on the bias voltage; this dependence is presumed due to the free-carrier contribution to the effective dielectric constant. Some direct broad-band measurements are reported for an active Gunn diode biased beyond threshold. These measurements provide additional insight into the conditions under which significant parametric action may occur in a Gunn diode."
"The packages in which Gunn-effect devices are commonly mounted are found to have parasitic reactances which are significant at X-band. An accurate knowledge of the package equivalent circuit is essential. Precision measurements in a coaxial system have therefore been made over a very wide range of frequencies, and a consistent equivalent circuit has been derived. This differs somewhat from previously assumed equivalent circuits. The experimental results are analyzed in terms of a theoretical model based on the known structure of the package."
"Frequency-saturation effects have been observed in the mechanical tuning characteristics of transferred electron (Gunn) oscillators operating in conventional waveguide cavities at frequencies from 12 to 40 GHz. Their existence leads to a restriction in oscillator tuning range and enhances frequency switching and hysteresis effects in the oscillators. Investigation of oscillator behavior in coaxial cavities as well as in waveguide cavities of varying height has shown that frequency saturation is caused by a coaxial resonance along the mounting post, which in the limit of fully reduced-height waveguide becomes the resonance of the diode with the encapsulation itself, or by a frequency limitation imposed by the diode thickness and operating voltage. The transverse coaxial resonance will occur in any waveguide size at a frequency near to if not within the band of interest. Simulation of the encapsulated diode by a localized reduction in mounting-post diameter shows that the frequency of transverse resonance can be increased by moving the encapsulation to a central position in the waveguide cross section. It is suggested that this technique and that of using cavities with a local reduction of height will make an important contribution to improving the performance characteristics of waveguide-mounted oscillators."
"A simple equivalent circuit using lumped constant elements is developed for the post-coupled-waveguide-cavity Gunn effect oscillator. The circuit is used to predict with high accuracy the tuning characteristics, loaded Q, and mode-switching frequencies for the oscillator. Characteristic capacitance and negative-resistance values for low-n/sub 0/L-product CW devices are also presented."
"A detailed analysis of an experimental resonator as a basis for determining the output power and the tuning range of Gunn oscillators as functions of the fundamental resonant-load resistance. Differing n/sub 0/L products (1.2 and 4.8x10/sup 12/ cm/sup -2/) lead to strikingly different results which are related to the delayed-and quenched-domain resonant modes, respectively. Variations of the second-harmonic frequency termination cause the fundamental output power of Gunn oscillators to change by a factor of up to 5, this change being accompanied by a frequency pulling of a few percent. From detailed impedance measurements it is concluded that the maximum fundamental power occurs if the second-harmonic circuit is tuned near an open-circuit resonance, the total circuit susceptance being somewhat capacitive."
"Compact circuits for obtaining high-efficiency operation of high-power transferred electron oscillators (TEOs) in L-band are described. One is a coaxial resonator and the other employs coupled TEM lines. The circuits are shown analytically and experimentally to be capable of matching a wide range of fundamental device impedances. Provisions for independently tuning the second-harmonic impedance over a wide range are included in both types of circuits. Pulsed conversion efficiencies up to 32 percent have been obtained TEOs mounted in the coaxial resonators and up to 27 percent with TEOs in the coupled TEM-line structures. The impedance at the second harmonic has been shown quantitatively to be extremely important in controlling device efficiency. By varying the second-harmonic tuning the device performance can be varied from high-efficiency operation to no output. Oscillators using these cavities were temperature stable over a wide range. The operating frequency of TEOs in the coaxial cavity and the coupled-TEM-line cavity varied less than 30 and 40 kHz//spl deg/C, respectively, over the range from - 54/spl deg/C to +125/spl deg/C."
"The development of a lumped model for small-signal carrier-field interactions in an IMPATT diode results in a set of state equations. Using state-space analysis techniques, the equations are solved for the small-signal impedance of a general IMPATT diode as a function of dc bias current and frequency. Read, p-n, and p-i-n diodes are studied using realistic values for saturation carrier velocities and carrier-ionization rates. Curves indicating the influence of diode physical properties on the small-signal impedance are presented. By combining state equations describing the behavior of the external microwave circuit with the diode state equations, the small-signal oscillation frequency and threshold dc bias current of a coaxial IMPATT oscillator are determined."
"A large-signal analysis for IMPATT diodes is derived, which allows carrier multiplication by impact ionization to occur at every point in the diode. Therefore, the operating characteristics of IMPATT diodes with a wide range of realistic doping profiles can be investigated. For a given operating frequency, RF voltage, dc bias current, and doping profile, the admittance, power output, efficiency, bias voltage of a diode can be obtained. An equivalent circuit the diode package, microwave circuit mount and diode, is obtained experimentally. Using this circuit, the admittance of the diode is measured by a reflection-type circuit and an oscillator circuit as a function of the RF voltage, dc bias current, and frequency."
"Equivalent circuits are introduced for nonlinear operation of the avalanche transit-time diode at a single frequency and at two harmonically related frequencies. Parameters are derived that characterize the nonlinear interaction between the diode and the associated microwave circuit. Particular attention is devoted to the oscillator, the frequency multiplier, and the frequency divider. For the oscillator, parametric interaction with a harmonic of the desired oscillation frequency is shown to give possibilities of enhancing the output power and of significantly improving the noise performance. An experimental two-frequency oscillator is described that has confirmed the theoretical predictions."
"Simplified analytical treatments of the TRAPATT mode of operation in avalanche diodes do not consider in sufficient detail the initial starting conditions for this mode. This paper examines this question in greater detail by analyzing a number of diode structures using a large-scale computer program. The results of these computer experiments have indicated that the requirements for efficient TRAPATT operation and the requirements for IMPATT operation diverge with increasing frequency. Since the IMPATT oscillation is required to start the TRAPATT mode, self-starting TRAPATT oscillators are increasingly difficult to fabricate as the operating frequency is increased. A novel diode structure is proposed which eliminates this problem and is capable of high-frequency CW TRAPATT operation."
"A technique for measurement of the large-signal single-frequency microwave amplifier admittance of avalanche diodes is described, and results are presented for silicon and germanium avalanche diodes. Single-frequency amplifier operation can provide a unique characterization of diode-admittance variation with RF drive for diodes operated near the optimum transit angle (the case in which all harmonic voltages are negligibly small compared to the fundamental). Such characterization is useful for predicting diode performance for circuits in which the harmonic voltages are not large enough to have an appreciable effect on the diode admittance at the fundamental frequency. A process of matching quadratic forms to the above admittance data which may be used for calculation of diode terminal admittance and power output is discussed. The usefulness of the measurement technique is illustrated by the agreement of the calculated maximum power output with the measured power output in a single-transformer coaxial circuit. The corresponding circuit admittance may be used for circuit-design purposes and for evaluating variations in diode-assembly techniques. The ability to obtain the diode equivalent circuit as a function of incident power allows studies in the design of the associated semiconductor device. For example, one has the capability of obtaining an accurate single-frequency large-signal model near the optimum transit angle, a model which can be studied without building a circuit. With this model it is possible to carry out optimization procedures at considerable savings of time and money."
"The characteristics of bias-voltage-controlled AM and FM of a CW Gunn oscillator are reported. It is found that the loaded Q of the microwave oscillator circuit and the microwave impedance level largely govern these characteristics. Modulation mechanisms are discussed. A particular mechanism, due to the nonlinear I-V curve of the device, is shown to lower the oscillating frequency as the bias voltage is increased. Performance of an automatic frequency control loop (AFC) is also described."
"An X-band IMPATT oscillator having a stabilized output power of over 0.5 watt has been developed. The oscillator consists of a main cavity and a directly coupled reaction-type cavity for stabilization. The oscillator has a frequency stability of 2.6x10/sup -5/ over a temperature variation ranging from 0/spl deg/ to 50/spl deg/C and an rms noise deviation of 15 Hz/1-kHz bandwidth at 500 kHz from the carrier. Design considerations have been made concerning the admittance characteristics of the circuit and of the diode to determine preferable circuit conditions for stabilization. The output-power loss due to the stabilization is as small as 0.4 dB. The oscillator is capable of operation in a frequency range of 10.7 to 11.7 GHz."
"The design and resultant experimental investigation of a pulling mechanism for a highly stable X-band Gunn oscillator, stabilized by a high Q TE/sub 011/-mode reflection cavity, are described. The oscillator shows a temperature coefficient of less than -7 x 10/sup -7/ / /spl deg/C,a low FM noise of 8 Hz per 1-kHz BW at 100 kHz from the carrier, and a wide-band mechanical-tuning capability of several hundred megahertz. In addition, experimental results concerning the hysteresis phenomena of oscillating frequencies, power, FM-noise versus cavity-pulling frequencies, and bias voltages are described."
"Subject to a reasonable constraint on the frequency of the amplitude modulation of the injected signal, the reduced amplitude equation for an injection-locked oscillator, a nonlinear differential equation, is reduced to a nonlinear algebraic equation which is solved numerically. AM limiting, power limiting, and output-power increment are calculated as functions of injected-signal amplitude for several types of negative-conductance nonlinearities. A method of characterizing the conductance nonlinearity from the measured output-power increment is given and is used to characterize avalanche- and tunnel-diode oscillators. Excellent agreement between calculated and measured limiting is shown. In addition to clarifying the amplitude behavior of the locked oscillator, the results show what types of nonlinearities are desirable for limiter applications, that avalanche-diode oscillators have the potential for excellent limiting, and that the output-power increment is indicative of the oscillator impedance match."
"To meet certain requirements for system performance such as broadening the bandwidth, obtaining a high gain for the FM-and PM-signal amplifier, and increasing the power output, the \"locking amplifier\" composed of cascade-connected and hybrid-combined synchronizing oscillators is described. How the SNR of the amplifier is greatly improved and its gain increased by cascade connection and hybrid combination is discussed. These have been ascertained by experiments. In addition, another broad-band and high-gain synchronizing circuit and its application to pulse code modulation-phase modulation (PCM-PM) signal amplification are also discussed."
"Stable CW and pulsed linear-reflection-type amplification at C- and X-band frequencies using epitaxial-GaAs transferred electron devices is described. These devices have a doping density-length product (nl) greater than 5 x 10/sup 11/cm/sup -2/. Criteria for avoiding the normal instabilities are discussed with specific regard for the circuit impedance, operating bias-voltage material characteristics, and the device temperature. The active impedance of a stable device has been measured, along with the effects of the package parasitic. These data were utilized to design multiple-tuned wide-band circulator-coupled coaxial-amplifier networks. Instantaneous CW bandwidths of nearly 1 octave have been measured in C-band, and instantaneous bandwidths of 4 GHz have been measured in X-band with single-stage Iinear gains from 6 to 12 dB. A -1-dB gain compression power output of 250 mW, with a saturated power output approaching 1 watt, has been realized from a single device. The noise figure of a single-stage amplifier has been found to be 15 dB. The phase response of a typical amplifier has been found to be linear with a differential phase shift of less than 20/spl deg/ /GHz. The amplitude linearity has been related to third-order intermodulation distortion and found to be comparable to that obtainable from traveling-wave-tube amplifiers (TWTAs). In a two-stage configuration a small-signal gain of 22 dB and a fractional bandwidth of 35 percent have been realized in C-band. A novel scheme for studying the gain response of pulse-biased devices using swept-frequency techniques has been developed. Pulsed amplification has been obtained with a power output of 2 watts at a 5-percent duty cycle with a conversion efficiency of 6 percent and a bandwidth of 1 GHz."
"The effects of large signals on the performance of avalanche amplifiers under various operating and circuit conditions are investigated. Numerical results from a large-signal computer program based on an approximate nonlinear analysis are compared with experiment. It is found that the resulting distortions in the gain response are particularly pronounced in multiple-tuned amplifier circuits. Transfer characteristics of avalanche amplifiers are examined and intermodulation measurements compared with those of TWTs. Preliminary data indicate that avalanche amplifiers compare favorably with TWTs in their distortion characteristics."
"This paper contains both theoretical and experimental results on the gain-bandwidth optimization of avalanche-diode amplifiers. These comprise a class of reflection-type negative-resistance amplifiers using avalanche diodes operating in the IMPATT or normal avalanche mode. Theoretical results on gain-bandwidth optimization are derived using various equivalent-circuit models for the IMPATT diode. These results form the basis for a design theory for broad-band avalanche-diode amplifiers. The basic model of the IMPATT diode is that of a band-limited negative-resistance device. Explicit gain-bandwidth limitations are presented in this paper for classes of modified Butterworth- and Chebyshev-amplifier responses. This is then followed by a description of experimental results on broad-band avalanche-diode amplifiers."
"In this paper are described the analytical design and experimental performance of broad-band IMPATT-diode transmission amplifiers. These amplifiers are negative-resistance loaded waveguide bandpass filters which do not employ interstage isolation. Computer-aided-design techniques for single- and multiple-stage amplifiers are described in detail along with performance of simplifiers based on these designs. Typical performance at X-band includes large-signal gains of 5-10 dB, output power of 1 watt or greater, and bandwidths of up to 10 percent. These characteristics are in good agreement with the design values."
"A low-gain amplifier dc-to-RF conversion efficiency analysis is presented. Three power-amplifier-efficiency definitions are compared, and it is shown that the generation efficiency is a useful quality factor for low-gain power amplifiers only if it can be assumed to be constant over a wide operating range. In the most frequently occurring case the generation efficiency is a function of drive and the dc operating point, and no single number provides enough information to characterize amplifier-efficiency performance. A graphical technique is presented for selecting the most efficient operating point for an amplifier with variable gain and generation efficiency."
"The experiment described in this paper is performed for the purpose of obtaining additional information that might help to elucidate the operating principle of the anomalous mode. The diodes under investigation are of a silicon p/sup +/-n-n/sup +/ mesa structure. The breakdown voltage is 160 volts; the punch-through voltage is 60 volts. The test setup is similar to a conventional reflection-type amplifier with the diode mounted in a coaxial-cavity-like circuit. The reverse-bias pulse drives the diode to a low avalanche current level at which anomalous operation would normally commence. In this case, however, the tuning and loading of the cavity and its associated stubs is intentionally arranged to minimize free-running oscillations. Any residual RF power is reduced to the level of weak instabilities without any strong harmonics or subharmonic. Only in the presence of an input driving power with a frequency at or near the resonance frequency of the system, does an amplified power of the same frequency appear at the output port. Starting from the residual level the output power increases proportionally with the input power until at higher drives a saturation level is reached. In this particular case, operating at 410 MHz, saturation is reached at 18.5 watts with a maximum power gain of 12 dB and a bandwidth of 26 MHz. This output is approximately 20 to 30 dB higher in amplitude than any observable peak in the residual broad-band frequency spectrum Operating the diode as a free-running \"hard\" oscillator at the same current level and frequency, 18.8 Watts of RF power is obtained. The initial and steady-state power levels are substantially the same for both amplifier and oscillator. A plausible evaluation of these results can be obtained following van der Pol's differential equation for a forced negative-resistance oscillator."
"An X-band avalanche-diode amplifier circuit is described which provides accurate and independent in-band impedance control (R and +jx) and orthogonal second-harmonic reactance control. Low-level gains of 13 dB with 500 MHz of bandwidth have been achieved using this circuit. Power outputs of 1 watt CW with 5 dB of gain and 14.7-percent generation efficiency have also been realized by carefully controlling the in-band and second-harmonic load impedance."
"The oscillator circuit proposed by Rucker to combine the output powers from several devices is analyzed. Because of the symmetrical structure of his oscillator, an eigenvector approach is employed with special care to overcome difficulties due to the inherent nonlinearity of the devices. It is shown that under appropriate conditions Rucker's circuit offers very stable operation. His experimental results are successfully interpreted in terms of our analysis."
"An oscillator circuit that has been particuiarly useful for testing millimeter-wave IMPATT diodes is described. Results of impedance measurements performed on a scale model are presented."
"Analyses of the packaged-diode-series resonant and antiresonant conditions of oscillation show that the antiresonant condition exhibits frequency versus temperature stability which is greatly improved as compared with that of the resonant condition. Frequency variation with temperature in coaxial-cavity avalanche transit-time oscillators is predominantly due to diode junction capacitance and cavity-length changes with temperature. By operation of the oscillator in the antiresonant condition, the effects of both the diode junction capacitance and the cavity-length changes with temperature are greatly reduced as compared with those observed in the resonant condition of oscillation. (The circuit will oscillate for line lengths intermediate to resonance and antiresonance; however, the temperature coefficient will depend on the extent to which the element C/sub a/ is shunted by the line.)"
"A step-iris resonator circuit which substantially increases the efficiency of limited-space-charge-accumulation (LSA) oscillators has been designed. The circuit design employs harmonic tuning that provides the proper impedances at the second and third harmonics of the oscillator frequency. The efficiency obtained with the step-iris resonator is about 1.7 times greater than that obtained with a conventional rectangular resonant iris."
"Computer simulations of the free-running oscillation of an avalanche diode inserted at one end of a multifrequency coaxial-line resonator are presented. The obtained transient behaviors indicate that for triggering of the anomalous-mode oscillation, a large-signal IMPATT-mode oscillation is not always necessary. The waveform of the anomalous mode under steady-state conditions can be constructed by the superposition of a sawtooth and a positive spike waveform."
"An analytic theory is outlined for the operation of avalanche diodes in the circuit first analyzed by Evens. This consists of a low-pass filter situated approximately one-half wavelength from the diode. The magnitude and rate of rise of the voltage for a given charge pulse are estimated, and expressions for the efficiency and diode impedance are developed. It is shown for this model, where the filter acts as a short circuit at all frequencies other than the fundamental, how efficiencies around 30-40 percent can be achieved. The theory is compared with Evans' experimental results and shows fair agreement."
"A metal ceramic microstrip oscillator circuit using high-efficiency silicon avalanche diodes mounted in capacitively loaded transverse-electromagnetic (TEM) coupled lines is described. The physical dimensions of the oscillator circuit are 1.5 by 1.0 by 0.5 inches high. Results achieved at L-band are 105 watts peak output at 1.5 GHz with 13-percent efficiency."
"This paper describes a simple compact L-band microstrip oscillator circuit using avalanche diodes operating in the high-efficiency mode. The circuit has produced 150 watts with 26-percent efficiency; the duty cycle is 1 percent at the 100-watt power level. The overall size of the circuit is reducible to 1 by 2 inches using metal-on-alumina microstrip. Frequency tuning between 1.62 GHz and 1.83 GHz with less than 1.2-dB variation in power output has been demonstrated."
"Described in this paper is a simple microstripline circuit suitable for supporting TRAPATT oscillations with the Fairchild FD-300 diode. The best result obtained was a pulsed output of 42 watts at 520 MHz with an efficiency of 9 percent. Also presented is a circuit model for predicting the frequency of operation. The resulting theory is shown to be in good agreement with the observed experimental data and provides a useful tool for designing low-frequency TRAPATT oscillators with small dimensions."
"This paper reports successful parallel TRAPATT operation of a very low-cost commercial diode type. The best result achieved was a pulsed output of 225 watts at 700 MHz with an efficiency of 33 percent. The result was achieved by using three diodes in parallel. An explanation of the success of parallel operation is given. It is also shown that precise control of breakdown voltage is not necessarily required for parallel TRAPATT operation."
"High-efficiency CW amplification has been obtained using germanium TRAPATT diodes. Several modes of amplification are described. The first mode gives approximately a 12-dB gain with a maximum efficiency of 25 percent at saturation. The second mode exhibits lower gain, but at a relatively low input power the diode switches into a locked TRAPATT oscillator mode with an efficiency of approximately 35 percent. Each of these modes exhibits a noise figure of approximately 120 dB. A third mode which allows the diode to oscillate in the TRAPATT mode at one frequency and to amplify at a second frequency has also been obtained. The noise figure for this mode is approximately 60 dB."
"Measured FM noise spectra of subharmonically phase-locked avalanche transit-time oscillators are presented. An improvement of the frequency-modulation noise is achieved."
"Injection-locking figure of merit has been derived for a negative-resistance oscillator in terms of the frequency compliance coefficient. A method of estimating this under small-injected-signal conditions for any device operating in any mode and a given circuit is described. The method requires the knowledge of the device impedance evaluated either from a large-signal analysis or experimentally and a proper description of the microwave circuit. A practical case of a Gunn-effect device operating in the quenched-domain mode has been described for illustration."
"The tuned-harmonic mode of IMPATT-diode oscillation is examined under the restriction of a maximum limit to the peak-to-peak voltage swing. It is concluded that if a peak ac voltage limitation is effective in limiting the output power of an lMPATT diode, the maximum output power is achieved under conditions which minimize the harmonic interaction and at an operating frequency equal to the transit-time frequency."
"Investigation has been made on the small- and large-signal admittances of a Si IMPATT diode in the frequency range of 8-12 GHz over high current densities. In order to separate the diodewafer elements from the parasitic elements of the package, the bias-sweeping method proposed by Gewartowski and Morris is employed. Representative plots are given for wafer conductance and susceptance as functions of frequency with current density as a parameter. In addition, the variation of the large-signal admittance with a function of RF voltage is presented. The data obtained are compared with analytical small-signal theory."
"Sample theoretical arguments are used to show that at low current densities the negative-resistance properties of a packaged avalanche diode may be represented by only three parameters. These three parameters may be easily measured with the diode in a nonoscillating state. Once these parameters have been measured for a diode, its oscillator performance can be predicted for any well-defined circuit with an accuracy of about 10 percent. An example characterization of a diode is described, and the predicted and experiments performances of this diode when used in an oscillator circuit are then compared."
"The performance of a microwave solid-state device not only depends upon its intrinsic characteristics but also to a large extent on the circuit interaction impedance seen by the mobile carriers in the device. In this paper the well-known perturbation technique for measuring the interaction impedance of linear accelerators and microwave tubes is adapted for measuring the interaction impedance of circuits for solid-state microwave sources. Experimental results indicate that the technique can provide a powerful method for circuit optimization and device characterization."
"An injection phase-locked oscillator is used as an input microwave-limiting amplifier for a microwave discriminator (FM demodulator) used for noise measurement. This amplifier simultaneously increases sensitivity by 6 dB and reduces the threshold (minimum measurable FM) by at least 10 dB. The oscillator can be frequency-modulated to calibrate the measurement."
"A simple modulation technique based on injection phase-locking theory is given for measuring microwave oscillator Q. The measurement procedure is described and typical data are presented for an avalanche-diode oscillator."
"Gallium arsenide Gunn diodes were mounted on a type-IIa diamond to reduce the thermal spreading resistance just under the wafer of the diodes. By using the diamond, the total thermal resistance of the diodes was reduced to half the usual resistance. A single-wafer Gunn diode on the type-IIa diamond produced 910 mW at 9.9 GHz with an efficiency of 3.1 percent."
 "The program executes the computational steps in a synthesis procedure for matched equiphase power dividers. The three-ports consist of n sections in cascade, with each section composed of two coupled lossless transmission lines of electrical length /spl theta/ and an intermediate resistor."

"The 1970 IEEE G-MTT International Symposium was well attended with a total of over 580 registrants. The Newporter Inn, Newport Beach, CA, USA, provided an ideal location for the Symposium; this setting was enhanced even further by the pleasant weather. If the four-day schedule with many multiple sessions seemed overly long to some, it had the advantage of permitting a wide range of papers and subjects to be presented. The listed technical program was supplemented by several late news items that were added to appropriate sessions. An overview of the conference events is given."
 "Theory is described for a computer program EHPOL which produces polynomial approximations to eigenfunctions of the Helmholtz equation in the interior of an arbitrarily shaped plane region. TWO types of boundary conditions are considered: homogeneous Neumann and Dirichlet. Neumann boundaries pose much fewer difficulties than do Dirichlet so considerable attention has been given to the construction of polynomial subspaces that satisfy the Dirichlet constraint. EHPOL evaluates the modes by the Rayleigh-Ritz method and employs efficient algorithms both for the setting up of the matrix eigenproblem and for its solution. For convex guides the program is fast, economical in store space, and produces solutions of remarkable accuracy. An analysis of the computing time for EHPOL is given. Eigenvalue accuracy is demonstrated by tables of exact and computed eigenvalues for E- and H-modes in circular waveguide. Full advantage may be taken of regions with symmetry axes. A FORTRAN listing and a description of the program is available."
"An analysis of the frequency response of interdigital capacitors, which leads to an optimal design, is given along with an expression for their static gap capacitance. The capacitor Q is given in terms of its geometry which consists of a planar interdigital thin-filrn conductor deposited on the surface of a relatively high dielectric constant substrate. Capacitance values ranging from 0.1 to 10 pF at L band with measured Q's in excess of 400 are realizable using 2-mil line and space widths on a 99.5-percent alumina substrate with a dielectric constant of 10.3. Experimental results obtained with a lumped-constant nine-section S-band Chebyscheff low-pass filter realized using spiral inductors and optimal designed interdigital capacitors are shown to be in excellent agreement with theory. The filter had less than 0.8-dB insertion loss and greater than 25dB return loss in the passband. The filter occupies an area 6.50 by 200 roils on a 24-mil-thick substrate."
"The excitation of the dominant HE/sub 11/ mode by a transversely oriented electric dipole on the axis of an infinitely long dielectric rod is studied. The method of analysis involves expressing the fields and the source in a Fourier integral in the z direction and a Fourier series in the /spl phi/ direction in a cylindrical coordinate system (/spl rho/,/spl phi/,z). The practical significance of the present study, in particular regard to the excitation problem in dielectric surface waveguides, is emphasized."
"The usefulness of point matching when the expansion representing the field diverges in the matching region is discussed in relation to previous work. It is shown that the presence of a metal boundary does not necessarily imply divergence of series representations at the boundary position. The Rayleigh hypothesis, which bears on this, and the extended-boundary-condition method are equivalent only in a restricted sense; the latter is hypersensitive to minute deviations of the field on the reduced boundary and is therefore unsuited to point matching for some shapes. A numerical example is examined in which the use of a divergent series gives little evidence of error from use in the divergent region. Attention is drawn to recent work in which the use of a sutliciently smooth spectral expansion is shown to be able to convert a series of divergent terms into a usable convergent series, permitting valid numerical computations with otherwise divergent representations."
"A new type of latching switch, which consists of a short-slot waveguide junction loaded with a latched ferrite at the coupling section, is presented. The behavior of this switch is explained by application of the concept of a short-slot waveguide directional coupler. In order to estimate isolation characteristics, the phase constants of the two modes in the coupling section loaded with ferrite toroid are calculated. Practical construction based upon the calculated results has been carried out, and a switch with 8-percent bandwidth has been obtained."
"The results of Chebyshev in the theory of approximation find wide application in the design of circuits and microwave components. Part of the comparatively unknown work of Zolotarev and Achieser which has found useful applications in the design of certain microwave components, especially of mixed lumped/distributed components, is described. Several new results are presented, including formulas which enable the approximation functions to be computed in a relatively simple manner."
"The distributed prototype filter consists of a cascade of shunt stubs of equal length alternating with uniform transmission lines, each of twice the stub length. If the stubs are open circuited, they may be replaced by lumped capacitors to synthesize a mixed lumped/distributed (L/D) filter having near optimum Chebyshev or Zolotarev characteristics. The rate of cutoff and the general character of the stopband region is predictable. The use of Zolotarev prototypes enables the impedance level within the filter to be controlled and gives greater selectivity. Designs suitable for either transverse electromagnetic (TEM) line or waveguide low-pass filters are presented. If the stubs are short-circuited, the prototype may be used to design quasi-high-pass or bandpass filters of very large bandwidth. An example is given of an inductive-iris-type filter of approximately 100-percent bandwidth for which previous theories have been unsuitable. The theory is capable of extension to more complicated mixed L/D structures containing both series and shunt elements."
"A new type of dual-channel rotary joint combining the TM/sub 01/ mode and the circularly polarixed TE/sub 11/ modes in circular waveguide has been developed for an X-band antenna employed in a satellite communications link. Low losses are obtained in the high average power transmit channel (12.5 kW, CW) to avoid excessive temperature rise and in the receive channel to reduce the noise temperature of the system. High isolation between channels is achieved with the compact multimode exciters."
"The characteristics of beam lead tunnel diodes and their application in low-cost microstrip reflection amplifiers are discussed. Three low-noise C-band amplifiers are described, including one with the amplifier printed directly on a garnet substrate with a three-port Y-junction circulator."
"Insertion-phase variations for dual-mode reciprocal ferrite phasers are investigated in this paper. Expressions for variation in insertion phase as a function of ambient temperature are derived, as well as equations predicting insertion-phase changes resulting from high-average-power heating effects. Experimental data for an S-band phaser designed to operate at high-peak and high-average-power levels are presented. A total change in insertion phase of 6.4 degrees for 1000-watt average input power is computed and measured within experimental accuracy. The merits of this class of phaser for high-power application are considered."
"The slot-transmission line on a dielectric substrate has many possible microwave circuit applications. This paper presents experimental data concerning the performance of bandpass and bandstop filters and a hybrid coupler; the work described was performed at S-band frequencies using the single substrate slot line geometry. Also included are theoretical data concerning the slot-line wavelength and characteristic impedance for the case of the slot-line configuration having dielectric material above and below the metsllization, the so-called slot-line \"sandwich.\""
"This paper discusses the mode of operation of certain partial height ferrite, Y-junction circulators. It is proposed that such devices operate in a turnstile fashion with modes propagating axially along the ferrite rod. A simple experiment on a 4-GHz circulator substantiates this proposal, and a millimeter-wave device operating in this manner is described."
"Impedance matrices including magnetic losses are developed for a number of lumped-element ferrite-loaded symmetrical three-port junctions. The scattering matrix eigenvalues corresponding to these matrices are determined as functions of frequency and circuit parameters and are used to analyze these three-ports with emphasis on their properties as circulators. A very compact broad-band thin-film lumped-element circulator is derived from the idealized equivalent circuit. An experimental model approximately represented by this circuit is shown to have a 20-dB isolation bandwidth of greater than 30 percent with an insertion loss of less than 0.6 decibel. A switchable circulator which requires no magnetic-field switching is treated using this same analytical approach. It is suggested that this type of analysis together with additional experimental refinement of equivalent circuits will lead eventually to a computerized design of lumped-element circulators."
"Realization of the bandpass fourth-order antimetric elliptic filter function in a waveguide structure is described. A mathematical model is shown to accurately predict the performance of the experimental narrow-bandpass waveguide filter."
"A K/sub u/-band nondegenerate parametric amplifier using a single-packaged GaAs varactor diode is described. A very simple structure of the single-tuned amplifier with a new type of idler choke is employed to obtain a large voltage-gain bandwidth product and a low noise temperature. The double-tuned operation exhibits a nearly flat bandwidth of 550 MHz at a 20-dB gain and a noise temperature of 280/spl deg/K at room-temperature ambience."
"A ferrite phase shifter has been developed to provide latching reciprocal phase shift over a moderate frequency band. The principle of operation is based on the use of dual-mode circularly polarized waves in the active ferrite with nonreciprocal polarizers to select modes that provide reciprocal transmission phase. The physical structure of the phase shifter consists of a metallized assembly of ferrite and ceramic dielectric. A ferrite yoke is fitted over a portion of this assembly to permit latching operation. The completed phase shifter has a very simple geometry that can be produced at low cost and has relatively low insertion loss. The maximum cross-sectional dimensions are small and are consequently compatible with application in two-dimensional electronically scanned arrays. Experimental results are presented for an X-band design having a 10-percent bandwidth centered near 9 GHz."
"A variational expression of the electromagnetic fields in dielectric loaded waveguides is derived. This expression is discretized using the finite-element method and an electromagnetic coupling matrix is derived and evaluated. No restriction is placed on the shapes of the triangular elements or the order of the polynomial approximation. A general finite-element computer program is described and dispersion curves and field plots of some dielectric loaded waveguides are presented."
"In an earlier publication, a procedure was described that permitted the application of successive overrelaxation (SOR) to the solution of higher modes of any uniform waveguide of arbitrary cross section, filled with an isotropic and homogeneous medium. An algorithm was described that employed a thirteen-point finite-difference operator formed from five constituent five-point operators, such that the resulting matrix was positive semidefinite at the correct eigenvalue and was positive definite otherwise. For compactness the method is called positive definite successive overrelaxation (PDSOR). For simplicity boundary fitting was accomplished by causing horizontal waveguide deformations at each horizontal mesh line to the nearest node point. This paper describes an improvement of the PDSOR algorithm to cater for unequal-armed operators so that the waveguide wall need not be distorted from its actual shape. Improved accuracy is obtained for fields in the vicinity of the boundary and for eigenvalues. A finite-difference first-order perturbation method (that makes use of the accurately determined wall currents) for attenuation in arbitrarily shaped waveguides is described. Normalized curves are presented giving attenuation of sets of TE and TM modes in circular, lunar, T-septate lunar, single-ridge, and T-septate rectangular waveguides."
"A type of elliptic-function low-pass filter that is easy to design and construct, has low passband loss, and is very compact is described. With simple scaling and a limited number of standard parts, a broad range of cutoff frequencies can be obtained. Experimental results are presented for three filters with cutoff frequencies of 0.75, 1.0, and 1.5 GHz. Each filter occupies a volume of about 0.5 in/sup 3/. A physical interpretation of the conventional scaling transformation S =S'/ /spl Omega//sub c/' is given for networks containing unit elements. Use of this transformation is shown to yield scaled networks containing microwave C sections rather than unit elements. Applications to broad-band impedance transformers are given and other possible applications are suggested."
"Some current trends in automated network design optimization which, it is believed, will play a significant role in the computer-aided design of lumped-distributed and microwave networks are reviewed and discussed. In particular, the adjoint network approach due to Director and Rohrer for evaluating the gradient vector of suitable objective functions related to network responses that are to be opttilzed is presented in a tutorial manner. The advantage of this method is the ease with which the required partial derivatives with respect to variable parameters, such as electrical quantities or geometrical dimensions, can be obtained using at most two network analyses. Least pth and minimax approximation in the frequency domain are considered. Networks consisting of linear time-invariant elements are treated, including the conventional lumped elements, transmission lines, RC limes, coaxial lines, rectangular waveguides, and coupled lines. To illustrate the application of the adjoint network method, an example is given concerning the optimization in the least pth sense using the Fletcher-Powell method of a transmission-line filter with frequency variable terminations previously considered by Carlin and Gupta."
"Phase shifts of opposing sign are produced in a finear section of microstrip by transverse and longitudinal magnetization of the ferrite substrate. Nonreciprocal phase shift is also produced by the transverse magnetization. Theoretical calculations of phase shift that account for both the diamagnetic effects and the tensor properties of the ferrite permeability agree well with properly constructed experimental measurements. These measurements use closed magnetic circuits to remove the nonuniform demagnetization effects. A lightweight reciprocal phase shifter has been constructed that utilizes both transverse and longitudinal magnetization at low drive power with closed magnetic circuits to obtain a high figure of merit."
"Theoretical considerations and measurements on wafer varactors using Schottky-Barrier junctions show their feasibility for millimeter-wave and possibly low submilliieter-wave frequencies. A degenerate parametric amplifier is described which can be electronically tuned over a wide range (/spl Delta//spl conint/=2 GHz)around24 GHz and reaches a very low noise temperature (<70/spl deg/K) when cooled."
"Dielectric resonators are useful microstrip-circuit elements for applications requiring high Q and small size. A simple design procedure is presented which permits the rapid and accurate design of cylindrical resonators for microstrip circuits."
"The design and performance of a K-band cryogenically cooled wideband (600-MHz) low-noise (110/spl deg/K) parametric amplifier for use in millimeter-wavelength satellite-communication earthterminal installations is described."
"Design information is given for microstrip on a thin sheet of polyolefin that is reinforced with aluminum. A balanced 6-GHz-mixer-70-MHz-preamplifier design on this material is described. A single sideband noise figure less than 6 dB is obtained over the operating frequency range with no tuning adjustments."
"A compact image rejection balanced mixer developed in microstrip medium is described. This integrated mixer gives over 20-dB image rejection and 10.6/spl plusmn/0.6-dB noise figure (including 2.5-dB IF contribution) over 8-to 12-GHz range ; it was designed on a 40-ohm impedance basis and is scalable to any 40-percent fractional bandwidth in the 1- to 12-GHz range."

  "Barium titanate has been known as a high-dielectric-constant material and used widely in the electronic industry. Therefore many attempts have been made to use this material as thin sheets or coatings~ but its refractory properties and the difficulty involved in vaporizing it have prevented its extensive use. The flame-spraying process has solved this problem in an economical way, requiring no vacuum chamber, no critical materials, and no costly electrodes such as platinum. A film as thin as 30 µm with a dielectric constant of more than 6000 can be made on iron tape 30 mm wide and 0.1 mm thick at a very low cost. The film thus produced shows many favorable characteristics and performance that cannot be expected from other dielectric films of comparable dielectric constant. This includes capacitance change of plus/minus 15 percent over a temperature range of -55 to +125°C for a film having a dielectric constant of 3000. The flame-sprayed coatings consist essentially of crystalline and glassy components. The crystalline component comprises cubic and tetragonal crystallites. The tetragonal crystallites have a variety of axial ratios (c/a). Applications presently considered for this material are fixed capacitors, variable capacitors, chip capacitors for hybrid IC circuits, and substrates for capacitor networks and/or RC networks. As an extension of this research, semiconducting barium titanate is also discussed here."
"Tables for the calculation of mutual inductance be· tween coaxial cylindrical coils are presented. 'They are based on electromagnetic theory formulas, which, while available for quite time, have not hitherto been tabulated. The use of these tables is explained by examples and definitions of the tabulated functions are given."
"A technique is described for high-speed electronic tuning of an inductive device capable of handling VHF powers in excess of 100 watts CW. Electronic tuning is accomplished by means of a controlled dc bias applied to an inductor with a ferrite core. The orthogonal relationship of the applied dc magnetic bias and the absorption and dispersion of the ferrite is fundamental to circumventing problems that hitherto have limited the use of ferrite in magnetically tuned circuit,,; handling RF power. As opposed to conventional magnetic-bias tuning, the ferrite core is operated above saturation. In this mode, it is seen that the ferrite cores can be operated with high RF fields with no detectahle degradation of Q and negligible distortion products. Specific examples are presented of file application of this new capability in medium-power amplifiers operating over the frequency range of 70-300 MHz."
"The resistance of metallized holes which connect diffcrent levels of metallization in an electronic package, is calculated by solving the 3-dimensional Laplace equation. The metallized hole considered is cylindrical with current flowing in and out through conducting lines. Four configurations are studied. Extensive tables giving normalized values of resistance haw; been obtained through computer calculation. The dimensions of the metallized hole and conductors are normalized with respect to the height of the hole, and in this way a wide range of geometries is dealt with. One important observation from these calculations is the strong dependence of the resistance on the geometry of the conductors carrying the current in and out of the metallized hole. An average current density can be obtained through the use of an equivalent conductor resistance for the metallized hole."
 "New knowledge and advances in materials-science technology and other fields impacts on the lives and work of many engineers. An important system for assimilating this new knowledge is through continuing education programs for engineers. The ideal program contains the means for identifying the new knowledge and developments that are relevant, the educational needs of the engineers and how best to satisfy them, and feedback loops for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Western Electric is deeply committed to continuing the education of its engineers. At its Corporate Education Center near Princeton, N. J., engineers participate in courses on a multitude of subjects. Here, too, the Western Electric-Lehigh University Fellowship Program is administered. One option in this program leads to a Master of Science in materials science. Smaller companies may find that on-campus university programs or part-time programs presented on the company premises are more adaptable to their needs."
"This paper discusses the problems of materials selection by the design engineer in terms of properties, cost, availability, use, processing operations, reliability of performance, and health hazards. Examples are cited, with emphasis on electrical, electronics, and communications technologies. In view of the variety, complexity, and sometimes subtlety of the factor involved in materials selection, a systematic approach is essential if the best use is to be made of available information in terms of requirements. Design of a Selection Index is proposed as a means of quantitative comparisons. The Selection Index is based upon the categories listed above and permits weighting of the various factors involved in order to maintain flexibility."
"The war effort in Southeast Asia has again highlighted the need for protective techniques that can assure the reliable performance of electronic equipments in tropical environments, for nonmilitary as well as for military purposes. Examples of typical field-failure types will be shown, and a review of the various types of failure mechanisms that can occur in the tropics and their interrelationships is made. The various protective techniques that should be utilized in upgrading the tropical resistance of equipments are outlined. These include case designs~ parts and materials selection, finishes, cleaning techniques and moisture, fungus and corrosionproofing coatings. The climatic and field environmental factors that equipment must resist are given. Recommended environmental tests that provide proof of the quality of equipments, parts, and materials are listed. The need for improved materials, protective techniques, and designs for improved tropical resistance are outlined. These techniques are applicable to many commercial-type electronic systems of today, which require high reliability and special tropical reliability in the field."
"The varieties of compounds and solid solutions in which simultaneous ferroelectric properties and magnetic order have been demonstrated are reviewed and literature references are given. Materials investigated so far have contributed to fundamental understandings of processes in crystals and a variety of techniques and subtle inferences have been required in their investigation. Classification of some substances, notably BiFeOI has aroused controversy requiring many experiments to settle. Theoretical considerations have concentrated on the interactions between electric and magnetic' fields, and on the type of magnetoelectric effect predicted to be characteristic of MOF. As yet, magnetic moments achieved are insufficient for device application, and frequently high electrical conductivity is a problem. However, the number of substances investigated is large, favorable individual properties exist in many, and the rate of research on such MOF together with new methods of synthesis imply improved properties in the future. From the applications point of view, the scientific field can be classed as emergent. Properties both below and above the Curie point are in some cases approaching those required for microwave application. Probable applications will be as improved or modified materials where ferroelectrics are presently used and in areas in which the interaction between electric and magnetic fields is utilized."
 "A basic understanding of the preparation and properties of electronic materials has become vitally important to a growing number of practicing electrical and electronics engineers. Any university that seeks to meet the needs of practitioners in those areas must make electronic materials science a significant part of its continuing education program. The continuing education program at the Institute of Technology of Southern Methodist University consists of more than sixty graduate engineering courses offered each semester to industrial plants within a 60-mile radius of Dallas via a closed-circuit talkback-equipped television network. This paper describes a one-semester televised course in semiconductor materials technology, which emphasizes the preparation, purification, crystal growth, characterization, and processing of materials commonly encountered in semiconductor electronics. The main objective of this course is to provide the practicing engineer in the semiconductor industry and the beginning graduate student in electronic sciences with a sound knowledge of the scientific principles underlying materials technology."
"A method is described for measuring the dielectric constant and the loss tangent angle of sheet specimens at frequencies above 1 MHz without requiring the measurements of thickness. Through the combination of the gap variation method [1]-[5] and the immersion method [6], [9], the main source of error in the gapvariation method, i.e., the thickness measurement of the specimen, is avoided. Also avoided are the possible sources of error encountered in high-frequency measurements using the immersion method such as the series resistances of the electrodes, of the capacitors used in the measuring circuit, and of the lead wire connecting the electrode and the circuit. This method is easy to use and takes little time as compared with the conventional methods. The accuracy is expected to approach that of the low-frequency immersion method."
"Two procedures, based on the Lissajous figure as observed on the screen of an oscilloscope, are described for the determination of electrical energy loss in dielectrics, particularly at higher temperatures. These procedures were employed to determine the losses in nonpolar state ceramic barium titanate within the temperature region 150°-550°C and over the frequency range 20 Hz50 kHz. The first procedure was used at a fixed frequency of 60 Hz and at relatively high field strengths. It was found that the loss L in microcalories per gram per cycle at fixed temperature and variable field strength E is given by the relation L = a2E2 + a4E4 where a2and a4are constants. At low field strengths the second term can be neglected. Coefficients a2and a4vary exponentially with the reciprocal of the Kelvin temperature. Using the second procedure at comparatively low field strengths for loss determination, interfacial polarization was observed from 200° to 400°C as shown by a sharp rise in the index e\" with decrease in frequency and by an inflection in each e\" versus f curve at constant temperature. It was found that the Maxwell-Wagner equation for a two-layer condenser describes the phenomenon provided that the exponent of f is 0.89 rather than unity, the concordance between calculated and observed values of e\" then being quite good."
 "The p-n junction geometry of active, passive, and integrated silicon devices is customarily determined by various liquid-stain and angle-lap methods. In fact, it has been necessary to develop many liquid-staining methods since the simultaneous evaluation of even simple combinations of p-n, n+n and p+p boundaries has not been possible within a single stain cycle. A novel vapor-staining method using nitrogen oxide (NO2or NO) and hydrogen fluoride overcomes shortcomings in such simultaneous boundary delineations. The simple vapor process performed in a fraction of a minute is directly and clearly observable with lowpower optics enabling exact control of the stain-pattern contrast to be obtained. Numerous epitaxial layer thicknesses and diffused junction depths have been measured easily via the vapor stain with an accuracy of better than 0.05 micron. The stain-process details and the results of measurements made on n-p-n and p-n-p transistor devices are presented."
"Controlling destructive resonant amplitude of printedcircuit boards in electronic systems is a common problem. This paper describes various methods available for reducing these amplitudes and presents data to show the effectiveness of each method when compared with a standard printed-circuit board."
"It has been reported that the electrical properties of RuO2-.based thick-film resistors are dependent on the particle size of the Ru02in the inks used to make the resistors. In order to explain this dependence, a mathematical analysis was made to see if the \"mixing rule\" equations used to blend end-member cermet resistor inks to give inks with intermediate resistance values could be applied. This analysis led to the conclusion that these mixing rules cannot be used to explain file changes in resistence and the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) that occur as the particle size of the RuO2in the inks is varied. It was found, however, that alterations in the elemental resistor structure associated with the variations in the particle size of the oxide could be used to explain the changes observed."
 "A procedure is given for the calculation of thermally induced mechanical stresses in electronic assemblies. This procedure can be used to calculate both elastic and plastic deformation during thermal cycling of multielement assemblies with complex configurations and heterogeneous material properties. It will give the strain (or stress) in each element at any temperature in the thermal cycle as the element undergoes elastic deformation, captive plastic deformation, or thermal ratchet. Several encapsulated systems were analyzed to demonstrate the applicability of the calculations to real assemblies. In one example, it was demonstrated that encapsulated electronic systems are subject to thermal ratchet. For the environmental temperatures used, it was shown that the assembly would grow (or ratchet) on each thermal cycle until one of the elements broke. It was found that thermal ratchet could be avoided by either decreasing or increasing the thickness of the encapsulant. In another example, a foamed cordwood module was analyzed to determine the effect of lead length on the stresses developed in a glass-cased component. It was shown that a small increase in the length of the component's leads significantly increased the stresses in the component."
"Frequently the electrical performance of silver contacts is impaired by the unavoidable growth of a sulfide film on the mating contact surfaces. In the case where one or both of the electrodes are silver, or partly silver, and a silver sulfide film is formed on one or both of the electrodes, the electrical performance is greatly deteriorated and is among the most complex found on contaminated contacts. A recent study of the electrical performance of various sulfided contacts is reported that showed that they are characterized by an increased contact resistance that is dependent on the voltage polarity, by a nonohmic relationship between the contact voltage and current, and by a resistance that changes with time. A theory is proposed to account for the observations made with these contacts that is based on the semiconduction properties of silver sulfide, the high mobility of positive silver ions in silver sulfide, the tunnel effect, the widening of established conduction channels through the film by electrical forces (B fritting), and the crystal structure of silver sulfide, which can be found in either one of two forms depending on its temperature."
"The nature and mechanism of the high-voltage pulses in the anode region of copper-vapor arcs have been investigated. Arcs are drawn between a 1.3-cm-diameter anode and a 5-cm-diameter cathode in the dc range of 30-400 A. Prior to anode spot formation and at constant current, the arc voltage exhibits HF pulses superposed on the dc voltage. The amplitude and frequency of repetition (= 500 kHz) of these pulses is highly erratic, and the total instability is evidenced as voltage hash. The hash amplitude increase with both arc current and contact spacing and, at 2.5 cm, varies from several tens of volts at 30 A to several hundreds of volts at 400 A. The hash is attributed to fluctuations in vapor and plasma density in the anode region. Although these fluctuations appear unrelated to the gross motion of the cathode spots, streak photographs indicate a time-variant cathode evaporation that may contribute to the hash phenomenon. A second contributory mechanism is suggested from experience of hash in the anode region of fluorescent lamps, and involves quasi-periodic emission from the anode."

"The radiation properties of parasitic loop counterpoise antennas are investigated in detail. It is found that the parasitic loop concept can be used advantageously to reduce considerably the undesirable effects produced in loop counterpoise antenna patterns due to the counterpoise edge diffraction effects. Results of extensive numerical and experimental investigation of various aspects of the parasitic loop counterpoise antenna patterns are reported. The method of design of such antennas is also discussed. Three such new antennas are proposed which appear to be capable of bringing out superior performance from the present-day VOR system."
 "A theoretical and numerical analysis of square Van Atta reflectors has been carried out with or without a conducting plate, used for mounting of the antenna elements. The Van Atta reflector investigated has antenna elements which are parallel half-wave dipoles interconnected in pairs by transmission lines of equal electrical length. The dipoles are placed in a plane which is parallel to the conducting plate when this is present. In the theory, each pair of antenna elements with the interconnecting transmission line is represented by an equivalent circuit. The mutual impedance between the antenna elements and the reradiation from the elements as well as from the conducting plate have been taken into account. The influence of the conducting plate on the induced dipole currents has been treated using the theory of images. The scattering cross section of Van Atta reflectors with or without a conducting plate has been examined numerically using an electronic computer, and some of the results have been compared with experimental results obtained by others."
"Standing-wave measurements on a periodic traveling-wave array of dipoles driven with glide-symmetric excitation from a coaxial transmission line show the existence of multimode propagation in certain frequency bands. This phenomenon is explianed qualitatively in terms of coupling of symmetric and antisymmetric modes of the dipole array by the excitation from an unbalanced line. It has not been found when the dipoles are driven from a balanced two-conductor line. The avoidance of such multimode phenomena is crucial to the self-balancing property of successful log-periodic dipole arrays."
"An aberration-correcting line source feed has been designed, modeled, constructed, and tested in the Arecibo reflector. The feed is a linearly polarized flat wavegnide 40-foot-long array illuminating 700 feet of the 1000-foot-diameter spherical reflector at 318 MHz. The antenna, illuminated by the new feed, yields an aperture efficiency of 70 percent with a peak gain near 56 dB, half-power beamwidth of 16.2 minutes of arc, and sidelobe levels below 4 percent of the on-axis gain. Vignetting losses are approximately 30 percent at the highest zenith angle."
"The Mie solution for the scattered electromagnetic fields from a sphere is briefly summarized. A refractive index chart is introduced which makes it possible to evaluate the modal coefficient for lossy materials without evaluating Bessel functions of complex argument. This refractive index chart is used for this purpose and also to find spheres made of different material that have the same scattering pattern and also to find the condition for resonance in small spheres. It is also useful in establishing a solution for the inverse problem for small spheres, e.g., evaluating the constitutive parameters from the scattered fields."
"Bounds on the near electric field outside a rectangular aperture in a conducting ground plane are obtained and analyzed. The results are used to predict the power limitations (due to microwave breakdown) for such apertuares."
"The analysis of multiport antennas may be approached by resorting to the powerful concept of eigenexcitations of the structure. They may be defined as the eigenvectors of the admittance matrix, i.e., those sets of voltages and currents at the antenna terminals which are related simply by a proportionality factor (eigenvalue of the admittance matrix). Similarly, the eigenexcitations may be alternatively defined as the eigenvectors of the scattering matrix. The analysis for this special kind of excitation is sometimes relatively easy. The general case may then be treated by utilizing superposition principle. An array of infinitely long longitudinal slots equispaced on a conducting cylinder is analyzed in detail. The eigenvectors of the admittance and scattering matrices are easily found because of the symmetry of the structure. Expressions for the eigenvalues of these matrices, and for the radiation patterns due to the array eigenexcitations, are found in the form of infinite series rapidly convergent (even for cylinders of large radius). By using linearity an expression for the radiation pattern of the single excited element in the array environment (the main result of this paper) is then established. Expressions are also given for the coupling (or scattering) coefficients. A number of numerical examples with different cylinder radii are discussed in detail."
"In this paper, the pendulum method for measuring the bistatic radar cross section of a target is proposed, based on the principle of modulated-scattering technique. A modulated wave is formed by swinging the target like a pendulum. This method has the advantages that the measuring procedure is very simple, an absorber-coated room is not required, and the measured value is independent of background waves. Theoretical aspects of the principle are first described, including various kinds of conditions; then the measuring method is given with experimental results."
"Numerical techniques are used for the analysis of mutual coupling in arrays of log-periodic dipole antennas. The analysis is formulated in terms of impedance and admittance matrices for the dipole and transmission line networks. Approximations are made to allow the solution for moderately sized arrays to be practical with the existing generation of computers. Antenna patterns for the array are expressed in terms of the current incident on each log-periodic antenna. Results are presented for systems of one, two, and three log-periodic antennas."
"A procedure is presented for predicting by computer the radiation pattern of an antenna in the presence of a radome. The case of a horn antenna radiating through an actual aircraft radome is treated in detail, and a comparison is made between computed and measured antenna patterns. Good agreement between theory and experiment is noted."
"The statistical distribution of backscatteringSfrom some randomly oriented simple configurations is considered in terms of the log-normal distribution. The log-normal parameters (mean and variance of lnS), for arrays, cylinders, and plates are obtained and shown to afford an accurate description of their backscattering statistics over a wide range, for sizes in excess of a few wavelengths. A reason for this correspondence is obtained by noting that the backscattering pattern of an array may be expressed as a product of factors which are uncorrelated with respect to random sampling. A product of independent factors leads to the log-normal distribution. Finally, results for some randomly sampled simple antenna patterns are given."
"A mathematical expression is derived for the quasi-near zone of a monopole antenna on a finite conductive earth. Measured data are used to show the effect of finite conductivity of earth on the current distribution of dipole antennas."
"A theoretical study is made for obtaining the pulse radiated from an impedance loaded dipole. Numerical results are presented for an antenna that is slowly charged and suddenly shorted at the terminals. The impedance loadings are chosen as those on an existing antenna located at Sandia Laboratory, Albuquerque, N. Mex."
 "An expression for the radiation admittance of an infinite planar array of rectangular waveguide apertures is formulated and a technique for finding the complete equivalent circuit of the waveguide to space junction is given. The formulation includes multiple layers of dielectric above the array ground plane and waveguide elements which are center loaded with dielectric. Experimental verification of the radiation admittance formulation and the equivalent circuit concepts is given."
"For a linear uniform array ofnelements, an expression is derived for the directivity as a function of the spacing and the phase constants. The cases of isotropic elements, collinear short dipoles, and parallel short dipoles are included. The formula obtained is discussed in some detail and contour diagrams of the directivity as a function of the spacing and the phase constants in the above-mentioned cases are exhibited."
 "Power pattern synthesis for linear antenna arrays is discussed without the usual phase constraint on the far field. Mathematically, the problem is to find the optimum nonnegative harmonic approximation to a given function. Two types of error criteria, defining the optimum sense, are considered."
 "An analysis is presented for calculating the backscattered fields of an electromagnetic plane wave by lossless dielectric spheres of arbitrary density. This method involves the Watson transformation which serves to split the exact Mie solution, given as an infinite series, into the geometrical optics fields and the diffracted fields. The former comes from the illuminated region of the sphere and may be obtained from the geometrical optics method. The latter comes from the shadow region and consists of two different types of surface waves. One is a \"creeping wave\" analogous to that of perfectly conducting spheres. The other is a wave which enters the sphere and emerges as a surface wave in the shadow region. This wave is unique to dielectric spheres and is the stronger of the two surface waves. In the widely used geometric optics methods it is assumed that the optics fields are the dominant contributors even though stationary rays which are not in the direction of backscatter must be added in to give a degree of agreement with the exact Mie series results. In this paper we derive the optics fields and show that they differ in some respects from those obtained by the geometric optics method. They are smaller than heretofore assumed and contribute negligibly to the backscatter in this particular range ofka(4-20). Using our rigorous approach we can show the diffracted fields to be the major contributors to the total backscatter. Numerical results for the backscattering cross sections using diffracted and optics fields, and optics fields alone will be presented for relative index of refraction of 1.6. The agreement between our results (diffracted and optics) and exact results from the Mie series is excellent. A subsequent paper will be concerned with the diffracted fields."
"An explicit formula is derived for the change of input impedance of a vertical electric dipole as a function of the distance of the dipole to a horizontal boundary with a prescribed surface impedancen. It is shown that, ifn \\ll 120\\pi, the result is consistent with the formula obtained by the compensation-theorem approach."
"A technique for synthesizing a ring array that will radiate a prescribed pattern in the plane of the ring is developed. The design is optimum in the sense of minimum ring diameter and minimum number of elements for a specified precision. Application of sampling theory to the development of a discrete-array synthesis procedure yields a direct interpretation of results (minimum aperture, absolute minimum number of elements) obtained by earlier authors. As an example, the synthesis technique is applied to the problem of designing a ring array for aircraft navigation use."
"A randomly varying medium causes both amplitude and phase fluctuations on a wave propagating through it. The time variations of the medium are shown to provide a mechanism for viewing isolated regions along the propagation path. A general technique for locating the refractive index variation regions and mapping their position versus distance along the propagation path is introduced in this paper. The novel feature of the new technique is that this mapping is obtained from an end view of the propagation path rather than an overview; thus, only one antenna is required at each end of the path. In developing the description of the technique, a nonlinear wave equation is derived to include the time variations in addition to the usual spatial variations. This equation leads to the retarded potential solution and to the autocorrelation function which is the desired mapping. The resolution of a source region in the medium is shown to be inversely proportional to its spectral bandwidth. An experiment atSband is proposed to measure filamentary electron density structures in the solar wind over a path length on the order of one AU. Processing ten hours of data will give a unity signal-to-noise ratio for 36 resolution cells in 4/10 of an AU path length or for 14 resolution cells in a one AU path length."
"Patterns of vertically polarized elements above circular finite ground screens directly on soil were computed, using equations obtained recently by Wait [1]. The applicability of a steering illumination, considered optimum for an array above a perfect ground of infinite extent to the ground screen case, was investigated. It was found that this illumination gives very good results even for a modest ground screen (16\\lambda) in the region above 3 dB beamwidth of the aperture, consisting of the elements and the images."
"A class of circuits is described that can be used with a phased-array antenna in order to allow a given array feed system to provide phase control for a phased array with many more elements. Alternatively, certain variations of these circuits can be used alone to provide phase control for small arrays while using only a single phase shifter for each direction of scan."
"Electromagnetic waves are launched and collected by the same directive radar antenna located on a reentry vehicle. The scattering obstacle is the fireball resulting from a nuclear detonation. The objective of this communication is to determine approximately the incoherent power scattered from the rough surface of the sphere available at the source at a specified time. The received power depends on many factors including the scattering cross section per unit area of the sphere and the area illuminated. The area illuminated is determined by the intersection of the sphere with a volume of space that is a function of the radar pulsewidth and the time of interest."
"The electromagnetic scattering from two straight wires, which intersect perpendicularly, is considered. First, the current distribution on the wires is obtained by solving numerically a system of integral equations. Then the scattered fields and backscattering cross sections are obtained using standard techniques."
"The impedance and radiation characteristics of a center-fed dipole with transverse feed-point displacement are derived. The effects of the feeder displacement upon the characteristics of a log-periodic array with such a dipole as its basic element are then reviewed."
"A method for numerical computation of the electrical near field from an infinite wire over a horizontally stratified earth especially at extremely small distances is presented. For extremely low-frequency (ELF) propagation in shallow sea waters the typicalEfield and power-flow distribution is shown at distances comparable to the sea-bed skin depth."
"The solution to the boundary-value problem required for the calculation of the effective noise temperature of planar antennas due to linear lossy inhomogeneous plasma media existing outside the antenna is presented. The resulting solution is in such a form that a computer program is readily obtained for numerical calculations when the plasma environment is assumed to be either a series of homogeneous slabs or a continuous model."
"Expressions for the reflection and transmission coefficients are derived for the case where the plane wave is incident on a conducting medium in which the conductivity varies linearly with distance. Such a medium may be considered to be a model of wave absorbers. Approximate representations of the coefficients are obtained in simple form expressed by the elementary functions. Numerical evaluation of the solutions is made and results discussed."
"The TM and TE modes excited by horizontally and vertically polarized line sources are investigated for composite ionosphere models and for high- and low-ground conductivities. The daytime propagation characteristics are comparable to those of a simpler exponential model. In nighttime propagation, the TE2mode has a smaller perturbing effect than in simpler ionosphere models; the ratio of TE to TM field components may change for various directions of propagation in such a way that a quasi-TE (or TM) mode appears to change into a quasi-TM (or TE) mode."
"The exact solution for scattering by a semi-infinite parallel-plane waveguide is expanded asymptotically for large separation distances between the two half-planes. The result yields a term-by-term comparison with the corresponding result derived by means of ray theory. The simple ray method does not yield complete agreement with the asymptotic form of the exact solution."
"The existence of singularities in the electric field in continuously stratified plasma is discussed and conflicting reports in the literature are reconciled."
"It is shown that a modulated carrier signal will suffer distortion on passing through a network whose phase shift is constant except for a change of sign with frequency. However, if there are a large number of carder cycles in the envelope, the net effect is to impart a constant phase lead to the resultant signal."
"Correlation intervals associated with surface irregularities, which are caused by setting errors, are determined by the size of the panels concerned. A method is presented by which one can allow the magnitude of the correlation interval to vary."
 "A new variational principle that applies to a wide class of electromagnetic problems is presented. This principle has the distinctive characteristic of always producing linear algebraic equations when the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure is applied using a trial field composed of a linear combination of variational parameters. The new technique is applied to a general class of antenna problems, and is specialized to the case of a dielectrically coated slot antenna. Experimentally observed admittance values atXband are presented and compared with theoretical predictions."

"The distribution over a cicular aperture in a ground plane that produces the best mean-square approximation to a specified radiation pattern is derived subject to constraints on the mean-square aperture field strength. The result is derived in terms of the functions most natural for a least square fit: the eigenfunctions of a finite (circular) two-dimensional Fourier transform."
"The three-dimensional diffraction of a scalar plane wave through a circular aperture in an infinite plane screen is analyzed and numerically computed for the case of normal incidence. A modified Babinet's principle is formulated, and this is used to find the diffraction of sound by an acoustically soft circular disk. The spheroidal wave functions are described and applied to the diffraction theory. Numerical values of the rigorous diffraction functions are computed, and these are compared to the approximation obtained by the Huygen-Kirchhoff formulation."
"An analysis is presented of the coupling between parallel-plate waveguides excited in TE modes. Integro-differential equations are formulated for finite arrays of such waveguides with arbitrary widths and spacings. The waveguides, moreover, may be loaded with dielectric plugs having different dielectric constants and thicknesses. Solutions to these equations are effected by the method of moments. Extensive numerical data are obtained for the coupling between two waveguides, and their characteristics are examined in detail. The results show that in unloaded situations the coupling diminishes monotonically with increasings/\\lambda, wheresis the separation between the waveguides and\\lambdais the wavelength. At a given frequency, moreover, the coupling for largesdecreases asymptotically ass^{-3/2}. By contrast, an asymptotic dependence ofs^{-3/2}was uncovered earlier for TM-mode coupling. It is found that substantially different coupling behavior may result when the waveguides are loaded by dielectric plugs because of the excitation by the aperture discontinuity of higher order modes, which propagate inside the dielectric but are attenuated in the unloaded waveguide region. Of particular interest is the observation, under suitable conditions, of resonance characteristics in the coupling as functions of both the frequency and the thickness of the dielectric plug. These resonances are found to occur when the impedances of a certain higher order mode satisfy the transverse resonance condition, and thus are the manifestation of the resonances of such modes inside the cavity formed by the dielectric plug."
"The input admittance and the current distribution of a finite vertical tubular dipole antenna located above an infinite dissipative half-space can be found as a function of the distance above and the electric properties of the dissipative half-space. An integral equation for the current on the surface of the antenna is formulated and subsequently solved by numerical evaluation of associated moment functions in the Fourier transform plane. The magnitude, but not the distribution, of the current is found to be strongly affected by the presence of the dissipative medium. At certain distances above the half-space, the input conductance of the antenna reaches its maximum value."
"A novel and rigorou formulation for mutual impedance among a class of idealized but realizable antennas is presented. Unlike past treatments of mutual coupling, which have proceeded from structurally specified antennas, the present treatment deals with a class of antennas, all the electromagnetic properties of which are rigorously expressed explicitly in terms of their radiation patterns alone. Employing a network formulation based on a scattering representation of electromagnetic fields in terms of spherical (or cylindrical) modes, the mutual impedances between such antennas are computed exactly. Several alternate representations for the mutual impedance are derived, one of which is an integral representation involving the power pattern function for both real and complex angles. In special cases, these exact results agree with published results obtained by applying well-known approximate techniques to structurally specified antennas. An important and illuminating example is provided by an infinite planar array of antennas radiating into a half-space for which the present formulation yields the well-known grating-lobe series representation of the active impedance without an explicit reference to structural properties of the radiating elements."
"The behavior of log-periodic dipole (LPD) antennas, which are compressed along the transmission-line axis, is studied both experimentally and theoretically. Compressed LPD antennas are found to be efficient, of low gain, and frequency independent. With compression, the radiation pattern approaches dipole-like behavior and the bandwidth increases slightly. It is also found that LPD antennas exhibit anomalous frequency-dependent behavior in narrow bands of frequencies (\\approx 1/8of a log period in width) when a reactive termination is used and when the scaling factor\\tauis below about 0.92-0.93."
"Optimization of the field scattered by an antenna has important applications in radar systems and as elements in passive communication links. A method is presented of optimizing the scattering from a linear array of half-wavelength dipoles at a prescribed bistatic angle. The array is excited by a plane wave incident at an arbitrarily specified angle. The field scattered by the array is maximized or minimized as a function of the parameters of a network connected to the accessible antenna terminals. The result is a matrix eigenvalue equation of orderN = \\frac{1}{2}M(M + 1)for the optimum parameters of anM-element array. It is known thatN - 1solutions of this equation exist, which yield a prescribed zero in the bistatic scattering pattern but they do not correspond to physical networks. Using linear combinations of these, we construct a family of optimum admittance matrices that satisfy necessary and sufficient conditions that they be admittance matrices of passive networks. The form of the matrices is such that the corresponding passive regions in the bistatic plane are easily determined. The corresponding network can then be realized using existing network synthesis procedures. The essential features of the theory are illustrated by synthesizing an optimum network for a two-element array. It is also shown that backscatter at any angle can be minimized independently of the receiving pattern of the array."
"The reflection coefficients of those waveguide modes, with propagation constants near cutoff, which are excited at the open end of a semi-infinite parallel-plate waveguide for frequencies from the microwave to the optical region are discussed in this paper. The reflection coefficients are obtained from a recently developed form of the factorization formula for the Wiener-Hopf kernel associated with this problem. This particular formula is suitable for numerical processing over the complete frequency spectrum. Results of representative calculations are presented graphically as functions of the ratio of waveguide size to wavelength."
"The compression of frequency-modulated RF pulses is discussed when the dispersive property of a lossless, isotropic, and homogeneous plasma is used to enhance the resolution of transmitted pulses at the receiver. Using the basic concept of group velocity, an expression is obtained for the carrier phase variation of a rectangular envelope pulse so that the pulse collapses on itself at the receiver. Unlike the chirp radar pulse, the frequency variation is not linear and the optimum detection of transmitted pulses depends on both the plasma frequency and the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. The method of convolution was used to obtain numerical results, which indicate that the formulation given results in compression for short propagation distances."
"For radio-wave communication with ionospheric propagation, it is useful to study the distortion of signals propagating through a plasma medium. The problem is discussed of finding the distortion of a pulse after it has propagated through a longitudinally inhomogeneous anisotropic ionized medium whose electron density varies linearly in one direction. As a model of the incident pulse source, the Gaussian envelope carrier pulse is considered. Dependence of the electromagnetic pulse distortion upon the duration of the pulse, the gradient of the electron density, the magnetostatic field, and the carrier frequency is mathematically studied in detail."
"In this paper the covariance and spectra for amplitude and phase fluctuations for a microwave signal propagated over a line-of-sight path through a turbulent medium are calculated. It is shown that the results derived under the assumption that the wavelength is much smaller than the inner scale of turbulencel_{0}are also valid when the wavelength is equal to or greater thanl_{0}."
"The time variation of the radiation field of a thin cylindrical antenna driven by a dc pulse is investigated theoretically. Computed values of the radiation field are presented graphically for successive instants of time as a function of the angle between the antenna axis and the position vector of the distant point in space and for different angles as a function of time."
"This paper examines the propagation of waves in media which are spatially homogeneous but whose properties vary with time abruptly or continuously. Emphasis is placed on the excitation problem and on source-dependent phenomena which are not evident when attention is given only to the source-free case. After a presentation and interpretation of various exact closed-form solutions for simple nondispersive and dispersive media undergoing sudden or gradual temporal changes, attention is given to integral representations required under more general conditions. In the ensuing far-zone asymptotic analysis, dispersion surfaces and space-time rays are used extensively for identification of wave packets and other wave constituents descriptive of the field, and a comparison is made between the asymptotic results and the exact solutions noted above. Asymptotic field solutions are then derived by a direct ray procedure, without intervention of integral representations. The examples considered exhibit a variety of phenomena, among which the most interesting is the focusing of reflected waves when a dispersive medium undergoes a sudden change."
"A family of illumination functions is evaluated. The key property of these functions is that they are everywhere infinitely differentiable in the aperture and at the aperture edge. Patterns are calculated for linear and circular apertures, and results are compared with those given by other illumination functions. Improved performance is given for very low sidelobe designs. Truncated versions of these illumination functions are considered briefly, with encouraging results."
"A numerical method based on the thin-wire electric field integral equation is used to calculate the radar cross section (RCS) of a wire grid with a resonant slot. The numerical results are in good agreement with experimental data for a wire grid, where the antiresonance is found to occur at a slightly lower frequency than a similarly slotted plate."
"An exact solution to the scalar Dyson equation in the bilocal approximation is given for a scalar wave obliquely incident on a random half-space whose mean dielectric constant is the same as that for the uniform nonrandom medium in the conjugate halfspace. It is shown that in addition to the dominant coherent wave, a second highly damped wave is weakly excited at the interface."
"A prediction model is presented that permits calculation of the probability of occurrence of distinct multipath propagation of pulse signals at VHF and UHF over irregular terrain. The model applies to terrain characterized by an irregular distribution of obstacles such as hills, buildings, trees, etc., so as to make it impractical to calculate the effect of multipath propagation by diffraction or bistatic-reflection theory. Statistical data on wave propagation over irregular terrain form the basis for the empirical model developed. Generally, the model predicts that 1) for constant transmitter-receiver separation, the amplitudes of the received echoes decrease with increasing echo delay, and 2) for constant echo delay, the occurrence of echo pulses increases as the transmitter-receiver distance increases. The results obtained from the model for rural, hilly terrain, and for a built-up metropolitan area are compared with available measured data."
"A technique is discussed for simultaneously operating a waveguide slot array in two different frequency bands to generate two independent radiation patterns. The technique permits frequency separations which differ by a factor up to about 2:1. The technique utilizes the propagation of orthogonal, dominant modes in a rectangular waveguide, each mode operating in a different frequency band. Several linear arrays were investigated atXandK_{\\mu}band; satisfactory array performance demonstrated the feasibility of the technique."
"In this paper an equivalent circuit is developed for a tee-fed slot antenna, and the equation describing its input impedance is derived. The input impedance for several antennas is computed and compared with experimentally obtained data."
"Chen and Cheng have proved the reciprocity principle for an unbiased single-component compressible plasma. The principle is extended to a biased single-component compressible plasma and an unbiased two-component compressible plasma."
 "The radiation fields from an electric dipole in a homogeneous, anisotropic, and compressible plasma are considered. Using the Fourier transform method, the problem is formulated in terms of three scalar functions, each of which satisfies the two-dimensional inhomogeneous wave equation. Asymptotic expressions of the radiation fields are obtained for the integrals by the saddle point method of integration."
"The design and development of two types of stacked, vertically polarized, collinear arrays of three independently fed omnidirectional antennas operating at frequencies of 1550, 2702.5, and 4252.5 MHz are described."
"Reflection of plane waves from an inhomogeneous medium is considered. It is pointed out that attempts to define a meaningful reflection coefficient within the medium are unsuccessful. On the other hand, if the observer is in the free-space region, there is a unique decomposition into traveling waves with a correspondingly unique definition of a meaningful reflection coefficient."

"A table ofE- andH-plane patterns of the circular loop antenna with\\beta b = 1.0loaded withZ_{L} = R + jXat\\phi = 180\\degis presented. The table gives useful information for determining the values of the load impedance for a given field pattern. The results were experimentally examined."

"Experimental measurements of the admittance of rectangular or circular waveguide-fed apertures illuminating a displaced conducting plate of finite area are compared with calculations where the antenna ground plane and displaced conducting boundary are infinite in extent. Also, included are results where dielectric plugs are placed in the aperture."
"Accurate numerical values of mutual and self-admittances are obtained for an array consisting of two monopoles having different lengths and radii. The monopoles are actually protrusions of the inner conductors of coaxial cables. The sheaths of the cables are connected to a perfectly conducting ground screen. Restrictions in the theory are the following: the monopoles must be thin,a/\\lambda \\ll 1whereais the radius and\\lambdathe wavelength,b < 3awherebis the radius of the coaxial cable sheath, andd > 10awheredis the separation of the monopoles. The procedure employed to obtain the mutual and self-admittances is to derive simultaneous integral equations for the current distributions and to solve the integral equations numerically. The results are given for the most part in graphical form. Comparisons are made with existing theory and with experimental data. Excellent agreement in all cases is observed."
"A story of my personal involvement in a rapid evolution of high-frequency electrical communication that began forty years ago and led to the merger of Kelvin's transmission-line theory, which had been the cornerstone of the telephone engineer's thinking, and more inclusive Maxwell's field theory is described. The early sections of this paper describe the state of electrical theories in those days, the environment in which I found myself, my prveious interests and education, and the problems I was presented with; these are the four factors which determined the direction of my subsequent work. In the course of this work I found that, contrary to the then prevailing belief, Kelvin's transmission-line equations were consistent with Maxwell's field theory and the restrictive assumptions usually made in derivations of these equations are sufficient but not necessary. The major part of this paper presents a sketch of the gradual development of comprehensive wave-propagation equations which are applicable to a wide variety of guiding structures. These equations form also the basis of a comprehensive antenna theory. The concluding section describes briefly my mathematical theory of linear arrays which led to the discovery of superdirective arrays."
"The feasibility and practicality of achieving improved performance from a stabilized antenna on a synchronous satellite by shaping the beam for optimum earth coverage is shown. Due to the difference in range and atmospheric attenuation from a synchronous satellite to various points on the earth, a conventional beam with maximum gain toward the center of the earth is inefficient because it has the highest gain where the least gain is required. Since the paths tangential to the earth are longest and since they traverse through more atmosphere, the antenna gain should be highest in this region and decrease to a minimum for the path normal to the earth (see Fig. 1). The flat portions at the edge of the \"ideal\" pattern allows for stabilization errors of the satellite. The ideal pattern has been calculated to give equal effective signal (including noise due to atmospheric attenuation and assumed preamplifier noise figures of the ground terminal and satellite) over the entire portion of the earth covered by the antenna beam. The ideal pattern is rotationally symmetrical and has the capability of dual orthogonal polarization. A relatively simple low-loss antenna that gives a good approximation to the ideal pattern is described. The antenna is a nine-horn array consisting of a large central horn surrounded by a ring of eight smaller horns. The central horn is multimoded to provide rotational symmetry and polarization purity. An optimum power division and relative phasing between the central and outer horns is made to give a pattern that closely approximates the ideal. Both theoretical and measured data are presented. Measured results confirm the beam shaping, rotational symmetry, polarization purity improved gain, and broad bandwidth expected from the array. A gain improvement of more than 2 dB over a well-designed conventional horn antenna has been demonstrated."
"An antenna processing system for target detection in receiver noise and heavy clutter is formulated by means of spacetime decision theory. The theory is applied to the case of a single target in clutter, with unknown target location and unknown amplitude and phase of the target return. The clutter background is assumed to be uniform in average power over the field of view. The target detection is accomplished by means of a generalized likelihood ratio test. A block diagram of the resulting decision-theoretic antenna processing system is shown. The decision-theoretic array does not form a beam in the ordinary sense, and consequently has equal gain in all directions in the forward hemisphere. However, the usual loss in gain occurring in conventional antennas which are omnidirectional does not occur in the decision-theoretic array. The decision-theoretic array is compared with conventional arrays to show the improvement possible by using the former. The quality criterion used to compare the systems is average risk, or the average probability of error in decision making. The array requires no scanning of any sort and is fixed relative to the vehicle that carries it."
"The maximum power that can be received from the currents in a spherical reflector is obtained with that feed which, when transmitting, produces a tangential electric field, at the surface of a mathematical cylinder that just encloses it, equal to the conjugate of the field that would be produced by the reflector currents if there were a theoretically perfect absorber on the axis. This optimum tangential field is worked out in the formE_{0} +(\\lambda/R)^{1/2}E_{1}+O(\\lambda/R) , Rbeing the radius of the reflector and\\lambdathe wavelength. The results produced by typical feeds designed according to this prescription have been computed for arrays of dipoles spaced along the axis. Typical aperture efficiencies for the Arecibo dish are 90 percent at 100 MHz and within 1 percent of the optical limit at 600 MHz. The optical limit is not 100 percent, however, because of polarization mismatch. More than 98 percent of the power is concentrated onto the dish abbve 300 MHz. Results are available for 30 to 3000 MHz, 0 to60\\degscan angle, and various dipole arrangements. Waveguide and dipole feeds for receiving arbitrary polarization, and measurement techniques for designing and testing them, are described."
"An analysis has been carried out to determine the edge effects in finite parallel-plate waveguide arrays. The method used in the evaluation is to compare the element patterns and reflection coefficients versus scan for finite arrays with the corresponding results for hypothetical infinite arrays. It is found that, in arrays of empty waveguides, an element has to be about four or five elements removed from the edge in order to be regarded as being in an infinite array environment. On the other hand, when the waveguides are loaded with dielectric plugs having suitable combination of parameters, considerably more elements are needed for the simulation of an infinite array environment due to the appearance of the resonant null in the array transmission coefficient. It is found, moreover, that even though there may be substantial variation in the radiation properties from element to element in finite arrays, particularly so in the case of moderately sized arrays, this variation does not seem to severely degrade the array performance in terms of beamwidth and sidelobe levels."
"A method is set up for a theoretical investigation of arbitrary backfire antennas based upon dipole structures. The mutual impedance between the dipole elements of the antenna is taken into account, and the field radiated due to a surface wave reflector of finite extent is determined by calculating the surface current distribution on the reflector plate. Numerical results obtained for Yagi backfire antennas and short-backfire antennas using this theory are compared with experimental results."
"The use of a simple trigonometric series to approximate the current distribution on isolated center-fed dipole antennas has been found to give accurate results. Unilike iterative and numerical solutions, the functional form of the approximate distribution permits the simple computation of the axial electric fields and radiating properties of the dipole."
 "The authors call attention to the equivalence between Sommerfeld's formulation for an oscillating dipole and the result based on the dyadic Green function technique. The complication resulting from the use of the set of the longitudinal vector wave functions in formulating electromagnetic problems is also pointed out"
 "The reflection coefficient of a nonhomogeneous plasma slab satisfies the Riccati differential equation. When the differential equation for the transmission coefficient is combined with the Riccati equation, the resulting expression is analytically integrable. It is demonstrated that transmission of an electromagnetic field through the slab may be expressed entirely in terms of an integral involving the complex wavenumber and reflection coefficient of the medium. It is shown that the exact theory presented here yields correct results when used to obtain the transfer function for a homogeneous imperfectly conducting sheet."
"The conditions for ignoring the ion motion for radio waves in a partially ionized plasma are deduced from macroscopic equations by comparing the terms in the generalized Ohm's law. The conditions under which Ohm's law becomes uncoupled from the momentum transfer equation are distinguished for the three characteristic height intervals in the ionosphere. The conditions for neglecting ion motion in each region are discussed."
"An analysis using image and geometrical theory of diffraction techniques for calculating the elevation-plane pattern of radial infinitesimal current elements mounted near or on perfectly conducting cylinders of finite length is presented. The radiation problem is resolved into two components, the dipole and the edge contributions. The computed patterns are compared with experimental results since boundary-value solutions are not available. Good agreement between theory and experiment is obtained."
"Radar and dc pulses of Gaussian shape are reflected from dry, damp, and wet earth for both vertical and horizontal polarization. The envelope of the radar pulse is retrieved following reflection and examined for distortion. The shape of the reflected dc pulse is also determined. Pulse distortion resulting from multiple reflections is easily formulated by constructing a composite transfer function consisting of the product of reflection coefficients and retardation factors."
"In this communication an experimental study has been made of the intensity distribution in the focal region of a wide-angle spherical reflector illuminated by a linearly polarized plane wave of wavelength 12.5 mm. Intensity distributions with respect to the transverse field components were measured along the axis and in several transverse planes. The corresponding distributions for the longitudinal component were measured along directions parallel to the axis and along the same transverse directions. The peak of the longitudinal component was found to occur at a distance of about three wavelengths towards the reflector from the position of the peak of the transverse component. Experimental results have been found to compare well with the available theoretical calculations."
"Observations with a phase-stable radio-link interferometer are described. Measurements of phase stability have been made at 2595 MHz with a baseline of 11.3 km. The phase behavior is worse in summer than in winter and this is attributed to changes in the atmospheric water content. Phase fluctuations are not large enough to affect seriously aperture-synthesis measurements."
"The electromagnetic waves guided by a periodically strip-loaded dielectric slab were investigated. The determinantal equation was obtained by assuming that the strips are narrow as compared to all other linear dimensions. Numerical results involving different combinations of the linear and dielectric parameters are presented in terms ofk-\\betadiagrams. The amplitudes of the space harmonics were computed and are discussed in connection with the characteristic phenomena such as radiation and coupling. In particular, the relations between the attenuation of the guided waves and the space-harmonic amplitudes are pointed out. As an interesting phenomenon, real solutions have been found to occur in the complex-wave region and this new result has been explained in the light of the space-harmonic amplitudes. The numerical results in the backward-radiation region have been verified experimentally by two different methods: by measuring the phase and amplitude variation in the near field and by calculation from radiation patterns. In both cases, good agreement with the theoretical results has been obtained."
"A measure of the validity of the first Born approximation for scattering from an inhomogeneous plasma is obtained. This measure is derived using the inequalities appropriate to quadratically summable functions and bounded operators. A simple upper bound for the ratio of multiple scattered power to first Born power is derived as a function ofB, the sufficiency condition for the convergence of the series."
"The characteristics of pulses received by an antenna when it is placed in the field of another antenna excited with step functions are studied. The transmitting and receiving antennas are rectangular loops loaded at their midpoint with a resistance to avoid ringing. The received pulses computed on the basis of an elementary radiation integral compare well with measurements."
"For any paraboloidal reflector operating in a focused condition, the aperture-field orientation may be obtained by first stereographically mapping the feed-polarization pattern and then overlaying the paraboloid aperture on the projection. Examples shown are for electric and magnetic dipoles, and Huygens source feeds pointed at central and offset sections of the paraboloidal reflector."
"A previous anlysis of circularly symmetric reflectors has shown that the focal-region fields consist of an infinite spectrum of hybrid waves. This communication shows that these fields in the case of paraboloidal and spherical reflectors can be closely matched over the open end of a corrugated waveguide propagating a small number of hybrid modes."
"Theoretical and experimental results have shown that a satellite repeater can be used to measure accurately transmit and receive gains of ground-communications antennas. The satellite provides a uniform phase front and, for any appreciable elevation angle, meets the height requirement as a boresight source for large-aperture antennas."
"An experimental and theoretical study of the radiation patterns of an aperture antenna attached by various types of metallic flanges is presented. Though simple and approximate, the analysis accounts for focusing, broadening, and tilting of the radiation beam, and the agreement with experimental results is good. A method to swing the focused beam is described."
"The performance of a 3-foot-diameter circularly polarized metallic lens antenna atX-band frequencies is described. The measured antenna gain, efficiency, half-power beamwidth, sidelobe level, and optimum focal length were determined for both on-axis and scan conditions. The effect of different lens illuminations for the on-axis case was ascertained."
"Using geometrical optics approximation, an expression is derived for the illumination efficiency of a shaped Cassegrain system when the feed pattern differs from a given pattern used for designing the shaped reflector system."
"The induced EMF formulation is employed to develop a closed-form expression for the mutual impedance between coplanar-skew dipoles, Numerical results are presented in graphical form."
"The field patterns of nonuniform arrays as predicted by conventional theory may differ substantially from more accurate patterns obtained with the three-term theory that takes account of the effect of coupling on the distributions of current in the elements. Nulls in the idealized pattern are replaced by significant values, which are not independent of the length of the elements as predicted by conventional theory. Rough agreement with idealized patterns is obtained when the elements are self-resonant."
"The diffraction by a cylinder-tipped half-plane is analyzed by the geometrical theory of diffraction. When higher order terms are included in the solution it is shown to be valid for cylinders as small as a tenth of a wavelength in radius. This illustrates the highly local behavior of surface diffraction."

"A test program has been carried out in the greater Washington, D. C., area to investigate the feasibility of wide-band transmission at millimeter wavelengths. Measurements were made between July, 1967, and February, 1968, over an 8-km path and between March and August, 1968, over a 32-km path. Experimental determinations of the parameters significant in the design and assessment of the capability of communications systems propagating in the 27-40-GHz frequency band were made. A description of the program, summary of the radio and meteorological data, and conclusions relevant to the transmission over both paths, are presented."
"Percent-of-time distributions of rain-induced fades obtained on a 6.4-km path in New Jersey operating at a frequency of 18.5 GHz are discussed for the period of 1968-1969; data obtained at 30.9 GHz on a 1.9-km path for the same period are also discussed. The attenuation distributions are compared with attenuations calculated from the distributions of average rain rates on the paths. With these data, it is found that distributions of attenuation can be predicted from the path-average rain-rate distributions for a given sample period. Detailed rain-rate and attenuation measurements at 18.5 GHz on the 6.4-km path are presented for the most intense storm observed in a three year recording period. Point rain rates in excess of 250 mm/h and path-average rates exceeding 180 mm/h were observed; the attenuation exceeded the 50-dB dynamic measuring range of the equipment for more than seven minutes."
"Signals at 9.6 and 34.52 GHz, propagated simultaneously over a slant line-of-sight overwater path, have been analyzed to compare the power spectra of phase-of-arrival variations and fading and to determine the coherence of these signals with regard to both phase variations and fading. The phase data at the two radio frequencies exhibited nearly identical power spectra from 0.01 to 5 Hz and very high coherence from 0.01 to 0.1 Hz. The coherence dropped rapidly above 0.1 Hz and was in most cases less than 0.4 above 0.5 Hz. The power spectra of fading were similar in shape at the two frequencies, but the fading spectral density was consistently higher at 34.52 GHz than at 9.6 GHz from 0.1 to 5 Hz. The shape of the coherence function for fading was similar to that of the corresponding phase coherence function, but the fading coherence was lower at the low spectral frequencies. The possible effect of the small spatial separation of the propagation path on the coherence analysis is discussed."
"Four empirical relationships are presented between the 3.3-mm attenuation determined from observations of the sun and 1) radiosonde measurements of the total amount of precipitable water in the atmosphere, 2) surface measurements of absolute humidity, 3) IR spectral hygrometer observations of the sun, and 4) observations of differential atmospheric emission at 3.3 mm. Fluctuations in atmospheric emission at 3.3 mm during good weather do not put any limit on the sensitivity of a dual-beam observing system using a receiver whose rms noise fluctuations in an output bandwidth of 0.25 Hz are\\approx0.5\\degK."
"Measurements of the difference between radio and optical astronomical refraction at\\lambda=8.6, 4.3, 3.1, and 2.2 mm are described. The measurement technique utilized solar limb crossing times observed with a 16-foot radio telescope. Results show the expected dependence upon atmospheric water vapor below\\lambda= 3mm, but radio refraction tends to approach optical refraction at the shortest wavelength."
"The results of line-of-sight propagation measurements at 37 GHz over a 10.0-mile overwater test site are presented. Measurements of the short-term fading statistics, and of the time, space, and frequency diversity parameters are included. Strong negative correlation was observed during both the space and frequency diversity measurements; negative correlation coefficients were as large as -0.8. The diversity improvement obtained was greater than the value expected from correlation calculations, which is attributed to the consistent occurrence of negative correlation in the vicinity of the interference nulls rather than the random occurrence assumed in the calculations. For the optimum case where maximum negative correlation occurs, sufficient diversity improvement is achieved with either space or frequency diversity to permit the elimination of almost the entire fade margin that is needed to overcome the multipath fading associated with reflections from the water surface."
"Effects of atmospheric changes on attenuation in the atmosphere are examined for the 5-mm wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum (48 to 72 GHz). Attenuation versus frequency and altitude for vertical transmission through the atmosphere, caused by oxygen absorption, are tabulated for geographical and seasonal model atmospheres. The attenuation effects of atmospheric water formations are discussed and compared to oxygen attenuation."
"A technique is developed to probe the atmospheric turbulence strengthC_{n}^{2}and the wind velocity along a path using millimeter waves as a tool. Data obtained in a line-of-sight millimeter-wave propagation experiment are processed and used as the source of information. The averagedC_{n}^{2}and wind velocity together with their gradients along the propagation path are calculated by inverting a set of integral equations. A numerical method is used to yield the least-square-error solutions. Comparison is made between the theoretically calculated wind velocity over a 33-hour period and that measured by a conventional anemometer."
"For scanning over wide angles at millimeter wavelengths, an antenna incorporating a radially symmetric lens is an attractive solution if the lens can be realized in a practical form. It is shown that suitable lenses can be constructed very simply, from natural dielectrics if desired, and a design technique for the optimal antenna is presented. Some results are given of analytical and experimental studies of a number of actual antennas operating at wavelengths near 4 mm. These confirm that practical solutions are available. Homogeneous lenses may be used up to antenna gains of about 35 dB, and a lens consisting of a single shell and a core is sufficient for most other practical requirements."
"This paper compares several forms for the absorption line shapes for atmospheric gases as applied to frequencies between 150 and 350 GHz. The contributions of various lines to the absorption in this frequency range are examined. Equations are presented for direct calculation of attenuation as a function of pressure, temperature, and water vapor density."
"Some characteristics of the directivity function of uniformly spaced and nonuniformly spaced arrays are presented. In particular, the lower bound of the directivity function and the asymptotic expansion for the directivity of some composite arrays are examined."
"The development of a 1.4-mm heterodyne radiometric system and the initial measurements taken with it are described. The\\Delta Tof the system at the antenna terminals was approximately18.5\\degK for a 0.25-Hz post-correlation noise bandwidth. Measurements show that the attenuation through the atmosphere at this wavelength is primarily due to water vapor, and an estimate of the zenith attenuation is given byA (dB)= 2.8w, wherewis the precipitable water in centimeters. Measurements of the antenna half-power beamwidths using the sun as a source show that at 1.4 mm the atmospheric turbulence effects are not appreciable for observations through the atmosphere at zenith angles less than45\\degwith a 15-foot antenna."
"The foremost millimeter reflector antennas in use are surveyed. Antenna descriptions are written by personnel at the institutions operating the antennas. The antennas described are the following: 1) MIT 28-foot and 120-foot (U.S.A.), 2) Lebedev and Crimean RT 22-meter (USSR), 3) Aerospace 15-foot (U.S.A.), 4) University of Texas 16-foot (U.S.A.), 5) AFCRL 29-foot (U.S.A.), 6) Bonn University 10-meter (Germany), 7) (CRC (DRTE) 30-foot (Canada), 8) NRAO 36-foot (U.S.A.), 9) Berkeley 20-foot (U.S.A.), and 10) JPL 18-4oot (U.S.A.). Antenna system descriptions include information on antenna performance, pointing capabilities, limitations, and principal applications. The antennas are used in radio astronomy and communication research. The reference section covers the major results obtained with the antennas."
"It is generally accepted that the Dolph-Pritchard technique for computing optimum or Chebyshev radiation patterns for single-lobe endfire arrays is valid for any array element spacing less than one-half wavelength. However, it can be shown that multiple-lobe radiation patterns will be obtained using this technique for element spacing less than one-half wavelength. A maximum element spacing for single-lobe radiation patterns can be derived, and this spacing is a function of the major-lobe-to-sidelobe amplitude ratio as well as the order of the Chebyshev polynomial. In general, for large amplitude ratios this maximum spacing approaches one-quarter wavelength."
"From theoretical considerations, it is possible to calculate attenuation through rain at several wavelengths. It is shown that attenuation is a linear function of rain rate for a 0.86- cm wavelength. This property is independent of the distribution spectra of drop radius within a ten-percent precision. This later property has been tested experimentally in two different ways. 1) Measurements through rain have been made with a radar at 0.86 cm. Results are reported. They show quite important differences between theoretical and experimental results. 2) Experiments have been conducted in rainfall to measure fall speeds and diameter spectra of drops. The apparatus used for this purpose is briefly described. With the results obtained it is possible to calculate the propagation properties of rainfall at several wavelengths, particularly at 0.86 cm. We hope to be able to compare the results obtained with those observed by radar in the future. The interest in short wavelengths for radiolocation or radio communication is well known, but when using shorter wavelengths we encounter greater attenuation in the atmosphere. We know that for wavelengths between 1 and 10 cm, attenuation by atmospheric gases may be neglected (except near 1.25 cm). At millimetric wavelengths, propagation is only possible in certain bands. At 0.86 cm, attenuation by oxygen and water vapor is not negligible, but can be considered constant. At the wavelengths of 0.4 cm and 0.20 cm, attenuation is dependent upon the concentration of water vapor, that is to says upon meteorological conditions. The effect of atmospheric particles is more important with shorter wavelengths. Practically negligible at 10 cm, attenuation by precipitation begins to be important at 3 cm and 5.5 cm and is strong at 0.86 cm and other milllmetric wavelengths. The purpose of the present work is to study theoretically effects of rainfall at several wavelengths."
"A millimeter wave propagation experiment was launched on-board the Applications Technology Satellite (ATSV) in August, 1969, and is providing the first information on the propagation characteristics of the earth's atmosphere for earth-space links in theK_{u}(12.5 to 18 GHz) andK_{a}(26.5 to 40 GHz) frequency bands. Seven participating stations commenced data acquisition operations early in October, 1969. Amplitude and phase measurements on two independent test links at 15.3 GHz (downlink) and 31.65 GHz (uplink) are providing propagation characteristics during defined weather conditions. These measurements will provide the systems designer with a data base to support performance predictions for projected millimeter wave links and will aid in determining the utility of these frequency bands for communications and data-link applications. The satellite did not achieve the 3-axis earth-oriented stabilization condition that was originally planned and is presently spinning at 76 r/min at105\\degwest longitude, in geosynchronous orbit. Modifications have been made to the existing data analysis program which permit the conduct of meaningful propagation measurements, even with spin modulated data. Spacecraft and ground hardware systems are described, including modifications required by the satellite spin. Preliminary measurements acquired at the NASA Rosman, N. C. station during the early months of satellite operation are presented, including comparisons of attenuation with rainfall rate, sky temperature, and weather classification observations. The data available to date (March, 1970) are not yet sufficient to fully describe the long-term propagation statistics over all expected weather conditions, but they are presented here in response to requests for information on the initial characteristics of the first experimental data available from an operational earth-space millimeter wave link."
"The feasibility of enhancing the radiated power or improving the directivity of a short cylindrical antenna by double impedance loading is investigated. An approximate solution for the current on a doubly loaded short antenna is developed, and typical current dlstributions, impedances, and radiation patterns of antennas appropriately loaded to implement enhanced radiation or high directivity are presented. Significant improvements in radiated power or directivity can be achieved with optimum impedance loadings. Theoretical predictions are verified by the results of an experimental study."
"The far field of a vertical electric dipole on a sectionally homogeneous ground plane is considered. The specific model used is a dielectric-like ground which is modified by using an inductive wire grid or mesh screen in a region surrounding the dipole. Attention is focused on the modification of the radiation pattern resulting from the presence of the inductive ground screen. It is demonstrated that the low-angle radiation may be greatly enhanced by a ground screen which extends out to 15 or more wavelengths."
"The iterative technique presented depends upon the solution of a set of simultaneous equations for perturbations of the element currents. Current distributions have been calculated which yield low sidelobe patterns from an array of2Qelements with only 0.25 dB less azimuth directivity than an orderQTchebycheff pattern that has the same sidelobe level."
"The number of nonredundant baselines obtained from the T, Y, and ring array configurations are compared. For the same number of array elements, it is shown that the ring array has the largest number of baselines. The Y array has the second largest number of baselines; however, it also has more potential for adjustments and future growth."
"An experiment is designed to confirm a rigorous theory on the three-dimensional electromagnetic scattering from a circular tube of finite length. Both axial and transverse components of the outside total current for the case ofEpolarization have been measured for two finite tubes withka = 1.895andkh = 0.4827\\piand0.724\\pi, both as a function ofzor\\theta. Special care was taken to preserve the continuity of the transverse current after each change in the position of the probe. The measured results are in good agreement with the theoretically computed data. Theoretical curves for the corresponding infinite cylinder are also included to show the limitations of using them as approximations to the currents on finite cylinders."
"Rice's small perturbation method is extended to obtain first- and second-order terms of the field scattered from a rough layer. The first-order terms are utilized to obtain average scattering cross sections. Lossy and lossless layers are considered for horizontal and vertical polarizations."
"A technique developed to obtain the Doppler frequency spectrum as a function of the angle of arrival for a received signal from sampled amplitude and phase information, taken with a data-gathering receiving array, is described."
"An upper bound on the error involved in approximating the actual admittance of an aperture in an imperfectly conducting ground plane by the admittance of the same aperture located in a perfectly conducting plane is obtained."
"The method of combining wedge diffraction solutions for the analysis of an axial TEM-mode slot is extended here for an arbitrary aperture antenna in a finite size ground plane. The new approach, however, considers superposition of boundary-value and wedge-diffraction solutions on the same antenna. The boundary-value solution (primary pattern) considers the pattern component when the aperture is in an infinite ground plane, and the diffraction solution (secondary pattern) considers the contribution to the pattern from the edges of the finite ground plane."
"Experimental results of the effects of dielectrics on the radiation pattern of electromagnetic horns are presented. The experiments were conducted with triangular and modified triangular shapes of dielectric materials. Because of the ease of fabrication, styrofoam was chosen for the dielectric. Furthermore, the low dielectric constant (\\epsilon_{r} = 1.03) of this material reduces the signal reflections at the air-dielectric interface. The dielectric was placed inside a 7-foot longE-plane sectoral horn operating atX-band frequencies. Near- and far-field measurements showed that the dielectric, in spite of its low dielectric constant, changed the phase and the power distribution across the aperture of the horn. By judicious choice of the shape and material of the dielectric, an antenna beam with sidelobes below -40 dB can be obtained."

 "The iterative method is useful to find the approximate solution of large systems of linear equations when the exact method becomes too expensive to be implemented. One well-known iterative method is the Gauss-Seidel method. The author presents an alternative algorithm which has certain simplicity in its formulation. He uses the system of linear equations encountered in the theory of coupled antennas to illustrate this method and give a physical interpretation of the successive approximations from the point of view of scattering theory. A simple numerical example is given to compare the products resulting from this method and those obtained by the Gauss-Seidel method"
"A method of calculating the radar cross section of a dipole deformed into a helix of low-pitch angle is briefly discussed. Theoretical backscatter results are presented that show how the cross section varies as the helix coils into several turns. An interesting property of the current distribution is also discussed."
"The radar cross section (RCS) has been derived by an approximate method for a thin dielectric plate and for thin spherical and conical dielectric shells. The computed results for a flat plate and a conical shell are compared with experimental patterns. The computed results for a conical shell are presented in the form of constant RCS contours on the aspect angle-frequency plane."
"Attempts are made to verify Kosta's [1] theory of log-periodic dipole (LPD) antenna, for LPD structures with separation angle (\\psi) between two halves not equal to zero (\\psi \\neq 0\\deg), using Monser's [2] experimental results. It is shown that this theory is quite capable of explaining the electrical properties of the LPD with\\psi \\neq 0\\deg."
"An investigation of expansion problems in terms of spherical wave functions from different points of view is given. The possibility of having infinitely many formal series representations for a given function in terms of the associated Legendre functionsp_{n}^{m}and\\sin \\theta(dp_{n}^{m}/d\\thetais also pointed out. One of the representations is derived by the use of the orthogonality relation, and the infinitely many others are derived by the use of the recurrence relation."
"A unique unidirectional octave-bandwidth reflector type circularly polarized antenna is described which uses crossed parallel connected conical dipoles operated near second resonance. The impedance characteristics of the antennas together with added series reactances gives the desired approximately quadrature current relation between the two dipoles. The axial ratio does not exceed 2 to 1."
"When the physical dimensions are adjusted properly periodic linear arrays, commonly known as Yagi-Uda arrays, may possibly be used as open waveguides or directional antennas operating at two or more widely separated frequency bands. Other applications include open low-pass or bandpass filters and open resonators."
"Matrix methods are applied for analysis and design of long thin-wire antennas with multiple excitations. It is shown how feed voltages can be determined to provide either specified values in a given pattern or maximum gain in some specified direction. Also, it is shown how passive loading can be included in the computational procedures and how in some simple cases load values can be computed to maximize gain in a given direction with respect to an unloaded wire of the same dimensions."
"A theory is developed and numerical results are given for some planar and nonplanar configurations"
"A general numerical technique for analyzing monopole antennas protruding from a conducting sphere is suggested. Computed results for special cases of antenna locations are compared to known and approximate solutions showing that the method is practical and accurate."
"The usual equation to calculate the antenna noise temperature meets various objections. A new equation is introduced."
"Backscattering cross sections of horizontal and vertical polarizations are computed for a conducting rectangular plate with emphasis in the region near grazing incidence. Three techniques used in higher order diffraction are compared, as they give rise to significantly different results in the region of interest."
"The scattering ofH-polarized plane waves by an infinitely long axially magnetized cylinder of uniform plasma with a perfectly conducting cylindrical core at its center is investigated for the case in which the radius of the plasma column is small in comparison with the wavelength of the incident wave. The total scattering cross section is found to have maxima at three resonant frequencies. The peaks of these resonances as well as the dependence of their sharpness on the various physical parameters are examined in detail."
"A method for determining the fields scattered by arbitrarily shaped cylindrical conducting structures with a transient incident wave is described. The transient scattering problem is reduced to the solution of a time domain integral equation which in turn is solved directly in the time domain by means of a digital computer. The approximate electromagnetic impulse response for a number of cylindrical scatterers is calculated using this method."
"The radiation and phase scanning properties of a planar array are investigated using wedge diffraction theory. The TEM and TE01radiation patterns are determined assuming that each guide is excited with equal amplitude but variable phase which is specified by the desired scan angle. Since the TE01pattern can be used directly as theH-plane radiation pattern of an equivalent rectangular waveguide array, the analysis for this instance is extended to consideration of aperture reflection coefficients"
"An annular aperture antenna driven by a coaxial transmission line is studied. An analytical and closed-form expression for input admittance is obtained. The effect of all higher order TMonto the admittance is found to be quite significant. Aperture field distribution is expressed in terms of the TEM and the first five TMonmodes. Higher order modes at the aperture can be estimated from the edge behavior. Near-field distribution based upon these modes is then cast into a form suitable for numerical evaluation."
"The integral equation for the current in a dielectric-filled tubular monopole when driven by a coaxial line with an assumed pure TEM mode is formulated and solved by a numerical method. It is found that when the dielectric-filled tube can support a TM01circular waveguide mode, the characteristics of the antenna are drastically different. In this case a very sharp resonance behavior is observed. The resonant length depends primarily on the properties of the internal waveguide mode rather than on the free-space behavior of the antenna."
"The boundary value problem of an infinite array of thin plates arranged in a doubly periodic grid along any two coordinates is formulated in a general form for an arbitrarily polarized plane wave incident from any oblique angle. The induced current on the plate, the near-field distribution, and the distant reflected waves can be obtained to a very close accuracy. Both magnitudes and phases of the reflection coefficients for some specific examples are determined explicitly. For the case of a wave incident normally on a rectangular lattice array of narrow rectangular plates, the calculated values are in excellent agreement with the measurements in a previously published paper."
"An extension of Oliner's theory is used to predict the impedance of slots with dielectric coatings. Theoretical curves are presented which show the change in impedance as a function of dielectric constant, dielectric losses, and dielectric thickness. The effect of a dielectric or plasma upon the resonant frequency is also included. The agreement with experimental dielectric-covered slot data justifies the extension of Oliner's theory."
"A circular-array radar antenna designed for operation over a 20-percent bandwidth has demonstrated improved performance over that of linear arrays. A major advantage is that the beam pointing angle is independent of frequency. The array developed and tested provides 128 beam positions with a beam crossover of about -2 dB, a half-power beamwidth on the order of 4 or 5 degrees, and a sidelobe level of -25 dB. Step increments of one element per beam position allow practical implementation of step scanning, i.e., simple commutation of the current distribution. Two approaches are possible for feeding and scanning the ring array: 1) a vector-transfer system involving 3-bit phase and amplitude boards which are capable of amplitude attenuation (VT scan) and 2) a lens feed system employing anR-2Rparallel-plate region, with the spacing between the plates less than 1/2 a free-space wavelength, so that only the electric-field component perpendicular to the plates is propagated. Energy is launched and extracted from the lens by means of monopoles mounted 1/4 wavelength in front of the circumferential ground plane enclosing the lens. Computations involved in determining current distribution are based on [1] and [2]."
"(See abstr. B10742 of 1970). The results of the quoted paper are compared with known solutions and interpretations. Even if the theoretical results were valid, they would not be supported by the particular experimental data that Fung and Chan have chosen to use. Two replies and a further exchange of correspondence are appended"
 "An investigation of defocused beam broadening by feed displacement in a parabolic reflector and its potential use as an acquisition means in a monopulse tracking antenna system is presented. The emphasis of the investigation is in the amplitude and phase characteristics of the sum and difference patterns as a function of both feed displacement and sum pattern taper. The investigation, which was performed both analytically and experimentally, shows that when feed defocusing is employed to achieve a beamwidth increase in excess of five times the defocused beamwidth, multiple nulls form in the difference pattern. Since these nulls are positioned relatively close to the beam center, acquisition is still possible under these conditions and the resulting tracking error should be tolerable for most telemetry and communication applications."
"Arrays of cylindrical dipoles and monopoles are usually driven by means of interconnecting transmission lines, whereas analyses of such arrays are generally made in terms of currents or voltages with assigned relative amplitudes and phases at the individual input terminals. Moreover, it is commonly assumed that the distributions of current along all elements are the same and without phase variation. The properties of broadside and endfire arrays are treated with full consideration of interconnecting transmission lines and the effect of mutual coupling on the distributions of current. Driving-point admittances and field patterns of arrays of half-wave and full-wave elements are given. A novel broadside-endfire array is described."
"Matrix equations are given for computing the scattered wave of a homogeneous gyrotropic cylinder. An incident wave with arbitrary polarization is assumed to normally illuminate the cylinder, which is magnetized along its axis. The reciprocity theorem is first applied to the interior of the cylinder. According to the boundary condition, one can replace the tangential components of the total wave on the inside surface by that of the sum of the incident and the scattered waves on the outside surface; the scattered wave is expanded in terms of a series of Hankel functions. Making use of the idea of Waterman's extended integral equation, one obtains the matrix equations to directly determine the expansion coefficients of the scattered wave. The matrix equations have been solved numerically on the NEAC 2200 and the HITAC 5020E for a circular ferrite (or dielectric) cylinder and an elliptic ferrite cylinder. The former solutions are shown to converge to the exact solutions, and the latter scattering patterns of interest are shown in graphical form for anEincident wave. The reciprocity theorem for scattered waves is also examined."
"By carefully accounting for the effects of Faraday rotation, certain of the polarization properties of radar echoes from the moon at 25 MHz could be estimated even though only a single-fixed linearly polarized antenna was used. The combination of Faraday rotation and antenna response sinusoidally modulates the linear FM signals used. This \"Faraday modulation\" does not appreciably affect the range resolution (which was about20 \\muS) but strongly affects the proportions of the cross-polarized components of the echoes. The measured frequency and phase of the Faraday modulation on each echo allows the determination of the proportions and, hence, the separate estimation of the components. Because the data reduction primarily involved digital spectral analysis, the effects of the modulation are interpreted in terms appropriate to power spectral estimation. The techniques used, but not the results, are discussed here."
"It is demonstrated that the knowledge of the incident field and the scattered far fields at one frequency may be employed to determine the size, shape, and location of a perfectly conducting scatterer. The reconstruction of the scattering body is accomplished via an analytic continuation procedure that generates the fields in the neighborhood of the scatter from the specified far-field distribution. The geometry of the body is then determined by locating a closed surface for which the total tangential electric field, i.e., the sum of the tangential components of the incident and scattered field, is zero. Whereas exact knowledge of the entire far field is sufficient to determine the scatterer, a technique is also given for size and shape determination when only part of the far field is available. Numerical examples of several different geometries are given for ranges of ka (a the largest dimension of the body) from 0.2 to 10. Geometries considered were elliptic and circular cylinders, conducting strips, and two cylinders. Plots of the fields reconstructed from the far-field data are compared to the known solutions, and the accuracy of the procedure is demonstrated. The effects of noise in the far-field pattern is also considered, and it is shown that even with noise levels of -20 dB the scattering geometry can be recovered."
"The transient magnetic field of a step-function excited electric dipole is calculated for ranges of 30 and 100 meters in a homogeneous conducting earth. The results show in a quantitative manner that the displacement currents influence only the early portion of the waveform."
"The boundary value problem posed by a linear antenna with sheath or absorptive surface in a compressible lossy plasma is formulated in terms of coupled integral equations. The integral equations are solved with the aid of a digital computer. The results presented here include the effects of sheath, collision, and absorptive surfaces on the current distribution, resonance, and antiresonances of the antenna. The analysis is most conveniently applied in studying an electrically short antenna which is of the order of several electroacoustic wavelengths long."
"The synthesis of optimum input signals for transmission through a lossless, homogeneous, and isotropic plasma is treated here. Matched filter theory is used in obtaining integral expressions for optimum input signals that can be solved approximately by the stationary phase method of integration. It is seen that the optimum input signals are amplitude and frequency modulated and result in a compressed pulse at the receiver which can be easily resolved. In addition, the ratio of the peak energy of the output pulse to that of the input pulse is seen to be large for long transmission distances even when the frequency of the input signal is limited to a narrow frequency range."
"A method is devised for calculating the antenna patterns ofn-arm spiral or conical antennas and is applied specifically to the determination of the\\Sigmaand\\Deltapatterns. These calculations are greatly facilitated, if not rendered practically feasible, by the use of bicomplex functions which are described. It is found that in the vicinity of the antenna axis, circular polarization is obtained in the\\Sigmapattern regardless of the nature of the antenna structure ifn > 3, and in the\\deltapattern ifn > 4; furthermore, each of these patterns is determined by the field at a single point."
"In a previous paper we discussed the geometric optics contribution to the scattering from a large dense dielectric sphere. This is a sequel to this paper and treats the more important diffracted wave contribution. The problem of electromagnetic wave scattering by a lossless dielectric sphere is more involved than that for the perfectly conducting sphere, since waves existing within the sphere can contribute significantly. The geometrical optics method which is relatively straightforward has been widely used for solving the problems of large, with respect to wavelength, dielectric spheres. Approximate expressions based on this method have been derived and have indicated that the geometrical optics fields are the major contributor to the total backscattering. However, a rigorous approach [1] based on the Watson transformation which splits the Mie series into two terms, geometrical optics fields and diffracted fields, shows that the former contributes negligibly to the total backscattering in the rangeka = 5to 20 for relative refractive indexm = 1.6. In this paper we confine ourselves to the diffracted fields which give rise to surface waves. It is shown that the dominant contributions come from the surface waves rather than the geometrical optics fields in the particular range where the geometrical optics fields have been assumed to be the dominant contributor. Although a rigorous mathematical analysis associated with the Watson transformation for the scattering problems has been known fundamentally for many years, a complete numerical result based on this transformation has not been available, especially for a dielectric cylinder or sphere. Such results would serve to provide a sound basis for understanding the scattering mechanisms involved and also would serve to check the validity of approximate expressions obtained under a particular assumption. Complete numerical results are included and lead to several interesting conclusions."
"In many applications such as precision direction finding systems, high-resolution monopulse systems, and interferometers it has become necessary to determine the phase patterns of the radiating element to a high degree of accuracy. A precision phase measurement technique for determining the phase centers of horn antennas atXband is presented. The results indicate that an apparent phase center of radiation can be determined to within\\pm \\frac{1}{4}electrical degrees for horn apertures as large as five inches."

 "A ray-diffraction method is described which is applicable to diffraction problems where the incident field on a diffracting edge cannot be represented as a single incident ray but exhibits a more complex form. The complex incident field may be represented by a combination of simple rays; the diffraction of each ray may then be treated individually. The total diffracted field is the sum of these diffraction components. The method is illustrated by applying it to the double knife-edge problem."
"A matrix equation for determination of plane-wave scattering from arrays of thin short-circuited dipoles of lengths about half a wavelength is derived. Numerical and experimental results are presented for linear, circular, and concentric circular arrays."
"The resistance of a plane grid condenser, moving in a magnetized plasma, is calculated using the quasi-hydrodynamic approximation for the plasma dielectric tensor. It is shown that, as a consequence of the anomalous Doppler effect, the resistance may become negative. Some implications for antenna measurements in the ionosphere are discussed."
"A computerized method to predict fading occurrence in VHF/UHF satellite transmissions, originating from multiple ground reflections is described. Based on ray optics the effective antenna gain is computed as a function of the elevation angle and ground parameters of unidealized irregular terrain."
"When the permittivity of a dielectric medium has a general power-law dependence\\epsilon(\\rho) = \\epsilon(\\rho0)(\\rho/\\rho0)^{P}in circularly cylindrical coordinates, the solution takes on a different form, depending on whether or notp = -2. This communication is addressed to the problem of showing that the two forms are, in fact, equivalent asp \\rightarrow -2. The equivalence is made evident through proper choice of the multiplying constant for the casep \\neq -2."
"New information regarding the complex permittivity and depth of the ice sheet near Byrd Station, Antarctica, and of the conductivity of the underlying rock has permitted recalculation of the attenuation and phase constants relevant to horizontally polarized very-low-frequency energy propagating over long ice-covered paths in the earth-ionosphere waveguide; improvement in the predicted axial attenuation is noted."
"The radiation of a monopole on ground screens is formulated by the diffraction techniques which have accurately predicted many other antenna patterns. Measurements have been made in the quasi-far-zone to check our formulation. A modified elevation angle is derived to transform our measured data into true far-zone data. The usefulness and accuracy of the present techniques are demonstrated by the good agreement between theory and measurement."
"A coaxial cone antenna whose aperture is in the plane of a ground plane has been described theoretically and experimentally in the time domain. Its response to an incident step along the ground plane is essentially a pulse whose width is equal to the diameter of the outer conductor at the aperture. Limitations on the cone dimensions are also discussed."
"Reflection lobes in phase-scanned arrays with traveling-wave feeds can significantly degrade sidelobe levels. These lobes can be dispersed if the regularity of the feed system can be destroyed. In this communication, an aperture phase distribution is described that provides the maximum reflection-lobe dispersion for an arbitrary reasonably smooth amplitude distribution. This phase distribution is an explicit function of the amplitude distribution. The theoretical limitations on reflection-lobe dispersion in one- and two-dimensional arrays are determined and compared with the calculated properties of a sample linear array. The edge effects are also indicated."
"The extension of holography to the microwave field, for the solution of problems such as antenna synthesis and construction of visible images of microwave illuminated objects, seems to be promising. In preliminary tests, the possibility of designing an antenna having any mean surface, any feeder, and any given radiation pattern by means of holographic technique, is shown. One of the practical problems which is encountered in microwave holography is the construction of the hologram, which requires the antenna to be synthesized. For this purpose, a series of holograms have been constructed and tested based on different approximations of the interference pattern. Another problem encountered is the presence of unwanted orders. Some preliminary tests on phase holograms show that this difficulty can be overcome simply by suitably varying the thickness of the hologram."
"The radiation fields of an open-cavity radiator are studied theoretically and experimentally. This antenna consists of a simple open-ended circular cavity with a primary radiator, which includes a dipole, a dipole array, a terminated transmission line, and a loop, placed at an appropriate location inside the cavity. For the case of the dipole array exciter, because of the presence of a parasitic reflector in front of the dipole element, the open-cavity radiator radiates like a short backfire antenna."
"The addition of particular hybrid junctions to a conventional Butler network can increase the number of antenna ports from an integral power of 2 to any number. The resulting extended network produces greater flexibility in the relationship between the number of simultaneous beams and the radiation pattern."
"When array antennas are used for wide-frequency operation a difficulty with grating lobes is encountered at the upper frequency end of the operating band. This paper points out that the use of arrays for transmission and reception with different interelement spacings can be used to extend the operating frequency band in a radar system. The principle of transmitting-receiving arrays with different illuminations was used by Mattingly [2] to lower the sidelobe level of a radar array antenna. Birge [3] used it to reduce the number of elements in an array while preserving the resolution. The same principle is used in this paper to extend the operating frequency bandwidth of a radar antenna system. Relationships for an optimized radar array antenna system are derived. The criterion for optimization is the maximum bandwidth with a given total number of elements. It is shown that in an optimized system the number of elements in one array antenna is one greater than in the other, and the ratio of interelement spacings is inversely proportional to the square of the number of elements in the respective arrays. Based on these conditions, a functionkis computed and tabulated. This function determines the number of grating lobes permissible in the specified angular sector, without overlap, as a function of the number of elements in the two arrays. An application to a high frequency (HF) ionospheric radar antenna system, now under construction, is used as an illustration of the principles outlined in the paper."
"Experimental measurements were made under controlled laboratory conditions to determine terrain backscatter in the 40- to 90-GHz frequency range. Terrain samples in a dry and wet condition included asphalt, concrete, gravel, wood, sod, and tall weeds. Smooth and rough water were also included. The\\bar{\\sigma}_{0}was established for angles of incidence from normal to45\\degwith the assumption that\\bar{sigma}_{0}was frequency independent."
"Measurements are described that serve to verify a recently reported new theory of arrays of arbitrarily located parallel elements especially including ones that are collinear and staggered. Since the theory takes full account of the effects of mutual coupling in determining the distributions of current in each element of an array, the experimental studies involved the determination of distributions of current and charge as well as admittances and field patterns. Since the theory should be a good approximation for dipole elements well over a wavelength long, complete measurements are reported for arrays of both half-wave and full-wave elements in collinear and planar arrangements. Experimental and theoretical results are in good agreement."
"An expression for the error, in the least mean-squared sense, between the desired pattern and the optimum line source approximation pattern is derived. It is shown that the previously used method of truncating the infinite series form for the error leads to highly inaccurate results."
"An analysis is presented of the interrelations among the radiative, scattering, and coupling properties of arbitrary lossless antennas. The analysis is based on a well-known scattering representation of antennas in terms of spherical modes in free space. This scattering representation is given a network interpretation which brings into focus the degree of interdependence between scattering and radiation characteristics. The scattering matrix of a reciprocal antenna with one port and a prescribed radiation pattern is represented in a canonical form which exhibits explicitly the permissible range of adjustments in the antenna scattering characteristics. The significance of the canonical form is examined from several points of view, noting in particular its connection with the concept of resonant modes of a scatterer. The network interpretation also facilitates the evaluation of mutual coupling, and the mutual impedance between two antennas is expressed explicitly in terms of the radiative and scattering parameters of each antenna. It is shown that, generally, the mutual impedance may be expressed as a sum of two terms: a zeroth-order term, dependent exclusively on the radiation pattern, and a second term involving the scattering properties as well as the radiation patterns. Under certain conditions the mutual impedance may be approximated by the zeroth-order term alone. It is also shown that a similar zeroth-order approximation of the active impedance in an infinite planar phased array leads to a grating lobe series type of representation."
"A theory of the log-periodic dipole antenna, which is a solution of the antenna boundary-value problem, is presented here. The theory is derived from Maxwell's equations by solving the wave equation in cylindrical coordinates and satisfying all boundary conditions. The theory is not limited to the log-periodic dipole antenna, but can be easily modified and applied to other antenna configurations using parallel linear elements. The radiation coupling between all antenna elements is taken into account; the calculated results show good agreement with the measurements. Current distributions, radiation patterns, and antenna input impedances are considered, and the application of this theory to the problem of optimal log-periodic dipole antennas is presented as well. Such an antenna obtained by numerical computation is discussed in detail."
"Through the introduction of a new parameter the radiation pattern of a phased array using digital phase shifters for beam steering can be made periodic, and pattern considerations can be confined to a very narrow range of the scan angle. Arrays designed on the basis of a least mean-square pattern error are shown to require the smallest absolute values of a phase-index function. A systematic and easy-to-apply method is developed for reducing the peak sidelobes of nonreciprocal phased arrays by one-step phase adjustments in certain elements. The amount of possible sidelobe reduction depends on the scan angle and the size of phase-quantization steps. Typical examples for 4-bit phase shifters show that reductions in excess of 9 dB are possible for certain main-beam directions."
"A resistive monopole was designed using thin-film evaporation techniques. Measurements of radiation patterns were made over a 100:1 frequency band and compared to the theory of Wu and King. Current amplitude measurements exhibited a more rapid fall-off at the higher frequencies than the almost linear decay observed at the low frequencies. The input admittance was found to have a relatively gradual increase with frequency and reached a final value of approximately (16 + j4) m\\OmegaM-1The efficiency of the antenna was observed to increase markedly with increase in frequency."
"The calculation of phase centers for rectangular and diagonal horns is presented. The calculation is based on a vector approach, by deriving the phase center from the expressions for the far field. Different expressions are derived for the phase center of theEandHplanes. The phase center for an arbitrary plane is calculated from theE-andH-plane phase centers. Graphs are presented showing the dependence of the phase centers on horn dimensions."
"The integral equation technique is used to find rigorous solutions of the current distributions on zigzag antennas. Through a new decomposition technique the currents are analytically separated into forward and reflected components, from which accuratek - \\betadiagrams of the structures can be obtained. For the case of log-periodic antennas, the forward component of the current also gives the characteristic admittance of the antenna, which can be determined hitherto only through many measurements or calculations."
"A phased array antenna element which provides good circular polarization over a broad sector of coverage in an array environment has been designed and evaluated. The concept is the superposition of complementary antennas, the dipole, and the slot, to achieve equalE- andH-plane patterns in the array environment. This element, when evaluated in a large test array, demonstrated an ellipticity of less than\\pm2.0dB over a coverage of\\pm60degrees. By proper control of the excitation of the two isolated antennas any desired polarization can be achieved."
"For a signal traversing the ionosphere, the second difference of phase shift versus frequency is proportional to the integral of electron density along the path and, therefore, to excess ionospheric group delay. By measuring this second difference at the operating frequency in order to make range corrections, the performance of very high frequency (VHF) ranging satellite navigation systems may be made to closely approach that of L-band systems. The application of the technique only requires an easily generated triple of continuous wave (CW) signals. The signal-to-noise and phase-stability requirements are relatively modest. A comparison with other possible techniques shows that the second-difference-of-phase system is probably the most attractive one."
"An analysis of how a transient voltage is radiated from a log-periodic dipole array is presented by adopting an idealized model of the array. Due to the frequency dependent phase center location of the array and an assumed slow wave phase velocity which varies logarithmically with frequency, a time delay which decreases with increasing frequency results. This causes the envelope of the radiated pulse to have a time dependence determined by the product of the antenna's admittance and the frequency spectrum of the input pulse with time being inversely related to frequency, and to have an instantaneous frequency which varies inversely with time."
"An aperiodic phased array of line sources with linear variation of element lengths and linear amplitude weighting which gives an approximately uniform redistribution of phase grating lobes for modest steering angles is described."
"Analytical expressions are derived for the total scattering cross section of two identical parallel nonoverlapping circular cylinders in the immediate neighborhood of each other.

"A simple graphical representation of the scattered amplitude and phase from a loaded wire scatterer is proposed. This representation includes circles of constant amplitude, straight lines of constant phase, and easily found points of maximum, minimum, and resonant cross section which are superimposed on the complex plane corresponding to the reciprocal of the self-admittance of the scatterer plus load."
"The numerical results for a coplanar array of identical V antennas are presented."
"Two uniqueness theorems are presented for those electromagnetic fields that are magnitude-integrable functions of time. In such cases, one may draw stronger conclusions than are allowed by the classic uniqueness theorems; e.g., the tangential components of such fields on any mathematical surface contained in a bounded dielectric material uniquely determine the fields at all other points in the dielectric both inside and outside the mathematical surface. Moreover, we may conclude that both the location and the strength of any sources imbedded in the dielectric are also uniquely determined. These results imply, for example, that the size of the antenna aperture does not place a fundamental limitation on the resolution capability of a radar system."
"Directivity of Chebyshev array factors is computed for element spacings up to 2 wavelengths and for up to 20 elements for sidelobe ratios of 25, 30, and 35 dB. Formulas suitable for computer use are given, and the different approach utilized for computer calculation as compared to hand calculation is discussed."
"The radiation from a spherical antenna covered by a finite layer of lossy hot plasma is studied. When the plasma is cold, the antenna radiation can be recovered or enhanced when the plasma frequency is increased beyond the antenna frequency. When the plasma is hot, in addition to the phenomena for the cold plasma case, an electroacoustic wave may be excited in the plasma layer and lead to some resonances. The electroacoustic resonances may lead to a very strong antenna radiation. A good agreement was obtained between theory and experiment."

 "Approximate numerical methods based on the use of finite differences are applied to surface waveguides of various types, including those supporting hybrid modes. The ultimate aim is to develope novel waveguides suited to use in guided ground transport systems."
        "The convergence of numerical solutions of several iris-type discontinuity problems in waveguides and periodic structures is investigated. It is demonstrated that the numerical solution of a set of equations obtained from a mode matching procedure (which corresponds to an integral equation formulation of the problem) may converge to an incorrect value if an improper ratio is chosen between the number of modal terms in the aperture and the number of terms retained in the kernel of the integral equation. The convergence properties of the set of equations obtained by an alternative mode matching procedure are discussed and general guidelines for efficient numerical computations are indicated."
 "The casaegrain reflector, when fed by a four element array, finds very common usage as an amplitude comparison monopulse system. The boresight sum gain and difference sensitivity essentially determine the range and pointing accuracy of the system. Although much is known about the cassegrain reflector [1] and extensive work has been done on an idealized parabolic reflector monopulse system as a function of feed size and excitation [2], little has been published on the cassegrain monopulse system."
           "An experimental investigation has been conducted to study the electromagnetic scattering from plasma-coated scatterers which include metallic and dielectric objects. The coupling between the electromagnetic (EM) wave and the electroacoustic (EA) wave in an inhomogeneous hot plasma is studied. The effect of the EA wave on the radar cross section of a plasma-coated object is observed. The possibility of controlling the radar cross section of a plasma-coated object by biasing the object with respect to the surrounding plasma is also studied."
                    "Interest in use of frequencies exceeding 15 GHz for satellite communications is steadily increasing, and indeed it is planned to share frequency bands between satellite and terrestrial systems. It is advantageous to consider use of two polarizations, thereby increasing the information capacity by perhaps a factor of two. However, fundamental limitations are imposed on such systems by effects of rain: attenuation, scattering, and depolarization. The present status of measurement and theory of these effects in the 15 to 100 GHz range is discussed. From terrestrial measurements, attenuation is known to depend on polarization; both this dependence and depolarization of the waves are caused by the oblateness of the raindrops. The role that path diversity can play in improving the reliability of satellite systems is evaluated from measured data. The techniques involved in measuring at the various frequencies are discussed as time permits. The use of radiometer measurements of noise from the rain for determining the attenuation is discussed in some detail. Since the measuring equipments are required to operate continuously in order to produce reliable statistics, advantage of solid-state technology is taken where possible."
    "A phased array is described that has been matched to operate over nearly an octave. A method of achieving very wide bandwidth with phased arrays integrated with transistors is suggested."
              "For a finite length, cylindrical, dipole antenna parallel to a perfectly conducting plane and driven by a DC pulse, the time variation of the radiation electric field in different directions has been computed. The dipole is assumed to have a half-length-to-radius ratio of 904 and to be spaced a distance equal to its half-length from the conducting plane. The dipole is assumed to be driven by a generator whose internal impedance is 780 ohms (an average characteristic impedance of the antenna) and which produces a periodic waveform whose period is such that the transient field produced by one pulse has died out before the next pulse occurs. The pulse width was taken to be equal to four-tenths the time required for pulse transmission to the end of the dipole."

Microwave and infrared radiometer measurements of the sky and water temperatures were made at various angles from the zenith down to the shoreline, at a nadir angle of55\\deg. A mercury thermometer and a network of floating thermistor beads were used to make simultaneous independent measurements of the water temperature. Analysis of the infrared radiometric data from Chesapeake Bay showed that for incidence or viewing angles of60\\degor less, the data could be corrected to within\\pm 1\\degC of the thermometer and thermistor data, by assuming specular reflectance at the sea surface for sky background radiation."

In the past, where decreased mobility and small area illumination were acceptable, the hand-held, or swimmer-mounted, lights were adequate. These older methods of illumination are obsolescent with the requirements for increased swimmer mobility and larger areas of illumination. Most commercially available underwater lights do not lend themselves well to large area illumination due to high cost and small angular beam spread."
"Remote sensing of ocean surface and sub-surface features is of interest to a large number of ocean and marine users. Scientists, meteorologists, engineers fishermen and commercial shippers all have requirements which make remote sensing by aircraft or satellite economically practical."

"The AC Electronics Division of General Motors Corporation has established a three-dimensional acoustic tracking range on the north edge of the Santa Cruz basin, south of the Santa Barbara Channel Islands off the California coast. The Santa Cruz Acoustic Range Facility (SCARF) contains four bottom-mounted hydrophones located in 4000 feet of water. These are cabled to an underwater termination chamber at the 6O-foot depth. Additional cables lead from the chamber to the control center located on Santa Cruz Island. The system will track a target in 3 dimensions in the spherical mode using three hydrophones within a circle 25,000 feet in diameter with an rms error of less than 10 feet. In the hyperbolic mode the system will track in three dimensions over an ellipse1 5,000 feet by 5000 feet to a rms accuracy of 10 feet and an ellipse 30,000 feet by 10,000 feet for an rms error of 30 feet."
"Ideally, an ultrasonic imaging system operating in the reflective mode would construct a recognizable two-dimensional image of an object in the presence of various disturbances any of which, in the absence of adequate detail, could be erroneously identified as the object itself. The final output of any such imaging system may be considered as a two-dimensional array of independent information elements; the number of image elements, in general, equaling the total number of information channels. The elements may use a common carrier either in part or in the entirety on their respective transmission channels. In all cases there is a transmitter, an object to be visualized, an electro-acoustic receiving device, an amplifier system, and an electro-optical display. It is concluded that it does appear possible to design an imaging system which uses both the diffuse and specular components of the backscattered ultrasonic energy from a submerged object that will yield detail and shape information superior to that obtained by specular return alone. A reasonable range for a compact system appears to be about 30 meters. Two major physical limitations are: 1. The extremely low diffuse power reflected from the relatively smooth targets which are anticipated, and 2. The large specular-to-diffuse reflected power ratio which can result in 11blooming11 due to the finite aperture of the imaging system."
  "A wide beam, forward looking, FM sonar using a purely audio information display, derived from twin receiving arrays, is described. The system was developed with the aim of providing an effective, but inexpensive, sonar for fishfinding. Preliminary sea trials with this system have indicated that accurate target tracking may be achieved without scanning of the transducers, and that the detection capability of the system, is considerable."
"Analog and digital data collection, processing, storage and retrieval, and acoustic telemetry techniques have been combined with undersea sonar transponder technology to produce a system for scoring missile impacts in unattended, remote, broad ocean areas.

"Pattern recognition techniques can be used in the design of computer programs for interpretation of the oceanographic seismic data. A typical pattern recognition problem is defined by feature measurements, pattern classes, and the decision rule. The physical parameters which describe the structure of the deep sea floors correspond to feature sets in pattern recognition. Examples of pattern classes are various rocks, sediments, mantles, and oceanic layers of low, medium and high porosity. The decision criterion is the minimum number of misclassifications. Specifically, the pattern recognition techniques are applied to processing of a digital seismic data tape supplied by the Woods Hole Oceanograpic Institution. A temporal array data processor combine the time-delayed data by using the stochastic approximation algorithm. Classification is then made between the recent sediments and the older eroded sediments."
"Last year the authors were concerned with an extensive series of sea trials which had been planned to extend the knowledge of the effects of the ocean medium on propagation of acoustic pulses of varying time-bandwidth products. Propagation is used here in its widest sense referring not only to the usually measured energy loss but also to the loss of coherence in this tYPe of pulse due to the temporal and spectral spreading effects of the medium and its boundaries."
  "The DEEPSTAR 20,000 vehicle will be propelled by an a-c induction motor designed for light weight, reliable operation at depths to 20,000 feet. It is a 2-pole a-c squirrel-cage induction motor which operates at a speed of 3450 rpm at full load, developing 10 horsepower at 60 hertz at 20,000 feet. The voltage established for 60 Hz operation is 82 V ac line-to-line. It is delta connected internally for a high order of system efficiency and compatibility with the controller. The motor operates in a petroleum based fluid maintained at a slight positive internal pressure relative to ambient. The motor windings are polyimide-enameled copper wire impregnated with diphenyl oxide resin varnish. Slot and ground insulation is polyimide film bonded on both sides of polyamide fiber paper, totaling about 10 mils in thickness. The insulation system offers reliable electrical operation with effective cooling characteristics when operated under load.

The method has been extended to a specified class of nonlinear problems. Cost and speed advantages for hybrid computation over all-digital computation have been found for this class of problems. A technique of model structure optimization, believed to be original, eliminates the usual assumption of model form with the result that the optimum model form as well as the optimum parameter set is found by \"growing\" models. Specialized hardware developments are required for structure optimization. Results obtained by the use of these techniques and devices are presented."

This discussion deals primarily with certification of a man-rated Hyperbaric Facility. An example of a non-man-rated facility is shown on Fig. 1. An example of a man-rated facility is shown on Fig. 2."
"Several years ago Honeywell's Marine Systems Center in Seattle started work on aprogram to develop an acoustic signal processor for an underwater vehicle. We were aware that refraction and reflection of the direct signal from the surface and the bottom would yield multiple signals and that refraction, although ever-present, cannot be accurately predicted. It became apparent that on certain days processors operating in thew ater seemed to behave abnormally. Attempting to correlate this abnormal behavior with known conditions, we found indications that a combination of reflection and refraction, producing multiple signal paths, might cause the noted abnormalities. A search of existing literature shed little light upon the effects of multiple signal paths on the performance of an acoustic signal processor. As a result the authors developed TRACE, a fast and economical means for evaluating the effectiveness of underwater vehicles in a realistically simulated undersea environment. The Honeywell TRACE facility has proved its effectiveness in analyzing design parameters and verifying actual performance of sonar-guided underwater vehicles. A unique feature of the TRACE facility is that it subjects acoustic signal processors to a multiplicity of signals occurring in the acoustic environment as a result of refraction and reflection. This paper describes TRACE, including some of the models used and the hardware designed to implement those models."
"Glass for deep ocean structres can experience local tensile stresses on the surfaces of internal bubbles even though the applied loads are compressive. To insure the safety and reliability of these structures accurate predictions of the probability of a failure originating at an internal flaw are made based on an assumed Weibull distribution of strengths. This analysis includes the effects of size and dissimilarities between the strength distributions of test specimens and the actual structure."
"Present shallow water physical and dynamic measurements are usually performed manually and are generally inefficient, costly, sparse in area coverage, and non-synoptic in observation. Some new and relatively low-cost instrumentation concepts are presented which appear to offer a practical and expedient approach to providing automatic, long-term, synoptic observations over large bay and estuary areas."
"The IIT Research Institute recently completed the undersea detonation of a 250-ton explosive charge in the North Pacific for the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). The cylindrical steel container constructed for the program was loaded with 243 tons of slurry explosive at Port Madison, near Seattle. The container was towed 2600 nm to its test location, 26 mi from Amchitka in the Aleutian Islands. The container was boarded, armed and scuttled at the test site. Data reduction indicated full explosive yield was achieved at the planned depth. Failure of some key contingency equipment (remote scuttle capability and secondary detonators) during the tow to the Aleutians led to a thorough review and reevaluation of the reliability and safety to the system. New techniques were sought to deal with the problem of safety and reliability. The purpose of the analysis was to determine those areas where additional or special effort may be required to insure a safe and successful completion of the mission."
"One of the most useful tools for evaluating the reliability and safety aspects of a life support system is the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Using this technique an analyst develops an orderly assessment of the cause, effect, and possible prevention of potential equipment failures. The analysis produces a unified document listing potential failures and causes which are studied at the system level. When used early in the design stages, recommendations for corrective actions can be economically incorporated. This work describes how Westinghouse Ocean Research and Engineering center engineers use the following procedure to analyze failure modes and their effects on a system during the early design stages. The analysis begins with the preparation of a block diagram showing the interrelation of all components in each sub-system and the input and output of the subsystem. A subsystem breakdown for a typical SCUBA shows three diagrams: (1) gas system, (2) electrical system, (3) water system. Each component becomes a subject for analysis. Next, worksheets are prepared for each listed component. The worksheets form the analysis documentation and contain the following information: mode, effect, cause, and prevention. After evaluation of the complete system, the finalized document is presented to management as a tangible acknowledgement of their requirements to produce safe, reliable equipment. The Failure Modes and Effects Analysis thus evolves into a management tool. A tool that serves to provide the impetus for insuring that all conceivable failures are considered and resolved as well as a tool for insuring the embodiment of failure prevention methods into system documentation."

"A problem in the development of deep-diving vehicles under the Navy's Deep Ocean Technology (DOT) program is that of circuit interruption. Devices used for on-off switching and for circuit protection are, when possible, mounted outside the pressure hull of a vessel for optimum weight and space saving. Protection from the surrounding sea environment is readily obtained by immersion in a dielectric fluid inside a thinwalled enclosure called a pressure compensating chamber, which is flexible to allow for fluid compression at great depths. The initial use of switches in pressure-compensating chambers showed frequent failure by the build-up of solid material, referred to as \"clinkers\", on switch contacts. At the Naval Ship Research and Development Laboratory in Annapolis, it was decided to take a closer look at the contact failure problem and attempt to provide technology for the design of circuit-interrupting devices applicable to future deep-ocean vehicle systems."

"In summarizing this report it can be stated that solar energy has been effectively applied to recharge nickel cadmium and lead acid storage batteries for periods of 6 months under natural environmental conditions in tropical ocean areas. The ultimate length of time over which this energy conversion can be accomplished will be answered in continued testing. Field testing over the six month period indicates no measurable deterioration of the energy conversion system. Effectiveness of a trickle charging technique is measurable by specific gravity measurements on a large ampere-hour capacity lead-acid battery. It was not found necessary to orient the solar panels to follow the sun position and that diffused sky brightness conditions over the ocean provide many more hours of effective high level sky brightness conditions than had been anticipated. Two panels were operating during the passage of hurricanes Camille and Laurie in the storm area in the Gulf of Mexico and no deterioration in performance has been detected. Results to date indicate a possible successful correlation of solar energy panels to the measurement of fog and visibility at sea."

"An experimental family of tones intended as telephone calling signals was generated by computer simulation. The synthesis technique allowed systematic manipulation of the parameters of the tones. Selected results of the computations were submitted to listeners for evaluative judgments. The evaluative data were analyzed by a multidimensional method that reveals the perceptual dimensions on which listeners' opinions differ. The dimensions thus defined were interpreted in terms of the parameters of the synthesis."
"A method is described for reconstructing acoustic hologram images using an electronic means which avoids multiple image formation. When the dimensions of the hologram are small compared to the dimensions of the viewing area, the incident waves are approximately plane rather than spherical. In this case the wavefront pattern can be resolved into components along two orthogonal directions, e.g., the x and y axes. Thus the information can be received by an array of transducers along only the two axes, instead of over the entire hologram surface as is customary. A disadvantage which occurs with reconstruction from plane waves is an ambiguity between right and left, resulting in the formation of multiple images. This effect may be avoided if the usual method of forming a diffraction pattern at the hologram surface by adding a reference wave is not carried out. Instead, the information is received and processed at the sound frequency f0. Spatial sine (Vs) and cosine (Vc) transforms are carried out first, and then demodulated. The essence of the unambiguous decoding method is to demodulate Vsand Vcby both in-phase and quadrature demodulation, forming four quantities which can be combined to give the required intensity. The combination of the four quantities is performed such as to effectively phase out the information from all directions except one and this avoids the formation of multiple images. The procedure is to be applied to both x and y axis information and the results multiplied to give a single reconstructed image."
"The fast Fourier transform (FFT) provides an effective tool for the calculation of Fourier transforms involving a large number of data points. The paper presents new and simple derivations for the two basic FFT algorithms that provide an intuitive basis for the manipulations involved. The derivation for the \"decimation in time\" algorithm begins with a crude analysis for the zero frequency and fundamental components using only two data samples, one at the beginning and the second at the midpoint of the period of interest. Successive interpolations of data points midway between those previously used result in a refinement of the amplitudes already determined and a first value for the next higher order coefficients. The derivation of the \"decimation in frequency\" algorithm begins by resolving the original data set into two new data sets, one whose transform includes only even harmonic terms and a second whose transform includes only odd harmonic terms. Since the first of the two new data sets repeats after the midpoint, it can be transformed using only the first half of the data points. The second of the new data sets is multiplied by the negative fundamental function, thereby reducing its order by one and converting it into a data set that transforms into even harmonics only; in this form it can also be transformed using only the first half of the data set. Successive applications of this procedure result finally in reducing the operation to the calculation of a large number of simple two-data-point transforms."
"This paper describes a noniterative algorithm for synthesizing vocal tract area functions. The vocal tract is parameterized in terms of a few of the low-frequency poles and zeros of the driving point impedance at the lips and the length of the tract. Using an asymptotic relation, ship for a Sturm-Liouville system, additional critical frequencies are supplied on the basis of the length parameter only. The algorithm, which is due basically to Richards, yields a structure which is a cascade of equal length uniform tubes of differing cross sectional areas. The number of such tubes depends upon the number of critical frequencies specified. Vowel data of Fant is used to test the algorithm. It is found that the synthesized area functions are good approximations to the actual ones. Because of the noniterative nature of the algorithm, execution time is very small."

"The technique of real-zero interpolation (RZI), first described by Voelcker, permits the interpolation of a minimum-bandwidth waveform to a set of zero crossings on the time axis. RZI can thus lead to bandwidth compression of intrinsically 2-level signals, or to the conversion of analog signals into a type that is impervious to instantaneous non-linear distortion. The purpose of the simulation study described was to examine how RZI performs in a realistic communication environment, i.e., when the transmission channel is noisy, has a finite dynamic range, and when zeros can occur only at discrete points on the time axis. Attention is focused on 2-level facsimile as the most likely candidate for RZI processing, but other types of signal such as synchronous data and synchronous pulse-width modulated waves have also been studied. It is shown that RZI can yield substantial bandwidth saving for signals that carry information by their zero crossings only. The price is paid in increased vulnerability to channel noise; this may limit the applicability of RZI to channels with over 35 to 40 dB signal-to-noise ratio. Excessive amplitude swings, intrinsic to the system, can be controlled by the insertion of complex zeros. RZI may lead to a bandwidth saving of the order of 6:1 for 2-level facsimile signals. Its data handling performance is characterized by the measured rate of 1.0 to 1.6 bit/Hz. An application to direct analog encrypting of speech signals by multiplicative distortion is also described."
"A functional representation of speech sounds in orthogonal polynomial space is described and preliminary results are presented. Speech spectra are approximated by a linear combination of orthogonal polynomials which are found to be more efficient than a linear combination of trigonometric functions. The original spectra (100 samples in frequency) and the polynomial approximations are represented by points in their respective Hilbert spaces, the distance between successive points being a measure of the dissimilarity of successive spectra. Segment boundaries are indicated where the distance between successive spectra exceeds a threshold. The effectiveness in segmentation of connected utterances using these spectral forms is compared. Also, representing speech in orthogonal polynomial space appears to be applicable to clustering and separating transformations which yield simple decision boundaries for phoneme classification. Although only one polynomial class is investigated, the procedure is valid for other functional representations of speech data."

"This paper describes the general approach, hardware, and computer program structure used in a speech recognition system coupled to a time-shared computer facility. The tasks that the system performs are split between the hardware, which is used for the complex analog processing tasks, and the software, which can more readily perform the pattern recognition and data file management chores. It is linked to a time-shared computer system via a voice-grade telephone line. An RCA 752 video terminal or a Model 35 teletype is used for entering control messages and to receive the output from the recognition process. The resulting system can be adaptively trained to handle a small but arbitrary vocabulary by any individual. The system operates in real time, with a speed of response less than a few seconds. The level of accuracy is comparable to that which has been obtained for similar medium-scale systems. The system is characterized by: 1) A novel configuration-with division of hardware and software. 2) Nonprivileged and real-time operation in a time-shared environment. 3) Low data rate-110 baud and voice-grade telephone lines can be used. 4) Use of context to segment large vocabularies and achieve lower error rates and reduce computation. These innovations point to the first steps toward a practical and economical speech recognition system."
 "High-frequency loss is a common hearing impairment and several methods of recoding speech have been developed to make better use of low-frequency residual hearing. An important application of these devices is to help the deaf person articulate correctly by providing him with usable auditory feedback of his own speech production. In one such device, /s/ and /sh/ sounds are replaced by low-frequency pulse trains which are clearly distinguishable, even to those having limited, low-frequency residual hearing. A pilot study showed this device to be of value in teaching severely hard-of-hearing children to articulate these sounds correctly. For the totally deaf, communication must involve some other modality. A simple, practical device is the experimental visual-tactile telephone which contains a voice-operated light and special tactile transducer for monitoring the speech signal. A key is provided for transmitting messages by some mutually agreed upon code. Another means of communication which may overcome some of the difficulties of Morse-code transmission is to spell out the message on the dial of a conventional Touch-Tone telephone. An experimental system for using a Touch-Tone set in this way is currently being evaluated. Since as many as three letters are assigned to each button, a simple code is necessary for identifying the transmitted symbol. One press indicates the first letter, two rapid presses the second letter, and three rapid presses the third. At the receiving end, the corresponding buttons on the dial are illuminated and the message can be decoded mentally. With additional circuitry, a simple decoding unit may be used to provide a visual indication of the transmitted symbols. Transmission speeds of 8 to 10 words per minute are typically obtained after 1 to 2 hours practice."
"Maximally flat rational functions with one pair of imaginary axis zeros are compared with the all pole Butterworth function for low-pass filter applications. It is shown that by using the location of the zeros as a parameter an advantageous trade between attenuation in the stopband and sharpness of the cutoff characteristic can be made. Graphs which serve as guides in the placement of these zeros and a practical design example are included."
 "The roundoff-noise outputs from two transpose configurations, each for the cascade and parallel forms of a digital filter, are analyzed for the case of uncorrelated roundoff noise and fixed dynamic range. Corresponding transpose configurations are compared on the basis of the variance, or total average power, and the peak spectral density of the output roundoff noise. In addition to providing general computational techniques to be employed in choosing an appropriate configuration for the digital filter, these results also indicate useful \"rules of thumb\" relating to this choice of configuration. Included are indications of good (although not necessarily optimum) sequential orderings and pole-zero pairings for the second-order sections comprising the cascade form. Computational results are presented which indicate that the analysis is quite accurate and useful."
"Recently, statistical models for the effects of roundoff noise in fixed-point and floating-point realizations of digital filters have been proposed and verified, and a comparison between these realizations presented. In this paper a structure for implementing digital filters using block-floating-point arithmetic is proposed and a statistical analysis of the effects of roundoff noise is carried out. On the basis of this analysis, block-floating-point is compared to fixed-point and floating-point arithmetic with regard to roundoff noise effects."
"Digital filters which have poles in their transfer functions are usually implemented by various direct feedback arrangements. Such filters can also be synthesized in a form amenable to implementation via the FFT. The key feature of this procedure is block feedback through a special finite-response filter. Although the procedure appears to offer few immediate practical advantages, its asymptotic properties are interesting. It also provides a useful conceptual link between recursive and nonrecursive filtering techniques."
"The organization of a special-purpose digital processor for performing nonrecursive digital filtering is described. The processor uses two complementary cascade fast Fourier transformers. Each transformer can simultaneously transform two independent data blocks of lengthNwords using\\log_{2} Narithmetic units and3/2 Ncomplex words of digital storage. Continuous filtering is achieved by sectioning the input signal, performing a fast transform on each section, multiplying by the frequency characteristics of the desired filter, and inverse transforming. The cascade organization of the processor allows processing at very high speeds. Word rates in excess of 3 MHz are possible with currently available hardware."
"An application of digital filtering to communication over a channel having amplitude and phase distortion in the frequency band occupied by the transmitted signal is presented. Described are a nonrecursive and a recursive digital filter which can serve as adaptive equalizers in compensating for the amplitude and phase distortion caused by the channel. The filter coefficients are adjusted automatically by the use of a test signal which is transmitted over the channel. The adjustment of the coefficients is carried out in the presence of noise with the aid of a steepest descent algorithm. The recursive filter, consisting of a comb filter in cascade with a bank of parallel two-pole filters, is shown to be especially suited for performing equalization. By choosing as a test signal sinusoids whose frequencies coincide with the poles of the two-pole filters, the coefficients of the recursive filter are easily adjusted."
"The speed of present-day logic elements is such that it is possible to effect real-time spectrum analysis of audio frequency signals by means of digital hardware. This paper describes a structure that computes the discrete Fourier transform of a 400-point time sequence in 10 ms. This allows the real-time analysis of signals having components in the range from dc to 5 kHz. A high-speed bipolar arithmetic section is used in conjunction with relatively slower MOS shift registers and READ-ONLY memory to provide an efficient and economical design."
"Designs for recursive and nonrecursive wide-band differentiators are presented. The coefficients for the recursive differentiators were optimally chosen to minimize a square-error criterion based on the magnitude of the frequency response. The coefficients for the nonrecursive differentiators were chosen using a frequency sampling technique. One or more of the coefficients were optimally selected to minimize the peak absolute error between the obtained frequency response and the response of an ideal differentiator. The frequency response characteristics of the recursive differentiators had small magnitude errors but significant phase errors. The nonrecursive differentiators required on the order of 16 to 32 terms for the magnitude error of the frequency response to be as small as the magnitude errors for the recursive differentiators; however, there were no phase errors for the nonrecursive case. The delay of the recursive differentiators was small compared to the delay of the nonrecursive differentiators."
"Presents the back cover of the periodical issue."
"A direct design procedure for nonrecursive digital filters, based primarily on the frequency-response characteristic of the desired filters, is presented. An optimization technique is used to minimize the maximum deviation of the synthesized filter from the ideal filter over some frequence range. Using this frequency-sampling technique, a wide variety of low-pass and bandpass filters have been designed, as well as several wide-band differentiators. Some experimental results on truncation of the filter coefficients are also presented. A brief discussion of the technique of nonuniform sampling is also included."
"The problem of synthesis of recursive digital filters to give a desired pulse response over a specified interval is studied. Realizability conditions are stated and a linear design method is developed. Several design procedures that require only linear calculations are given for approximate realization of recursive filters. Finally, an error analysis of the techniques is made."
"Models for a class of narrow-band digital filters and a class of wide-band digital filters are developed and analyzed The analysis forms a basis for a computer-aided design technique for such filters. Our aim is to show that useful performance can be achieved within the constraints of very simple realizations."
"The subject of this paper concerns the analysis of high-radix FFT algorithms appropriate to hardware implementation of nonrecursive filters and the error propagation properties associated with these algorithms. Variations in the structure of high-radix fast Fourier transforms are illustrated by means of their Kronecker product expansions. The implications in hardware design of the different structures are discussed. These implications include tradeoffs between memory size and throughput rate as shown by Comparison of the logic organizations of serial and cascade fast Fourier processors. It is shown that in a high-radix cascade processor, significant reduction in memory can often be obtained with a modest increase in complexity of the arithmetic units. The relationship between the permutation matrices specified in a Kronecker factorization, and the structure and addressing of memory is brought out. As an example, the implementation of a nonrecursive digital filter is included using a radix-4 factorization which provides for an extremely simple memory organization. The permutation matrix is such that both data storage and addressing are provided using serial MOS shift registers. In order to compare the accuracy of high-radix algorithms relative to the base-2 algorithm, a fixed-point simulation study of the error propagation properties was conducted of a full radix-4 and a radix-16 FFT for N= 1024 and 256, respectively. The computational errors were compared with corresponding results obtained from the base-2 algorithm. The results of the simulations were also compared with a model which is a modification of that reported by P. D. Welch. The modification consists of the representation of roundoff error buildup in the radix-2 and radix-4 FFT in closed form by a nonhomogeneous difference equation. The illustrative example chosen is the lower bound discussed by Welch."
"A method for estimating the pulse-transfer function of a linear time-invariant sampled-data system from on-line input and output records is presented. The impulse response of the system is approximated by a finite linear combination of a set of discrete orthonormal sequences. These sequences can be generated by a chain of digital filters. The method is based on the fact that the system output at a given instant is the sum of the products of the system Fourier coefficients and the up-to-date input Fourier coefficients generated by passing the input through the chain of digital filters. The system model coefficients are chosen to give a least-squares fit between the actual system outputs and the model outputs. A recursive form of the estimation equations is derived. This allows the estimates to be updated easily with additional observations."
"The design of a special-purpose on-line processor for bandpass analysis with application to spectral estimation is described. The processor utilizes a digital filtering procedure based on the frequency shift of the sampled signal spectrum. A peculiarity of the processor is that it performs a bandpass analysis by using a unique set of digital filter coefficients for all the analyzed bands. A small and simple memory is therefore used as coefficient memory, while a special, but not complex, organization with many sections is required for the sample memory. The processing of an audio signal to obtain a type of digital vocoder is also considered. From the point of view of the actual implementation, only MSI and LSI circuits are used for the memory and arithmetic units."

"A practical method is described for designing recursive digital filters with arbitrary, prescribed magnitude characteristics. The method uses the Fletcher-Powell optimization algorithm to minimize a square-error criterion in the frequency domain. A strategy is described whereby stability and minimum-phase constraints are observed, while still using the unconstrained optimization algorithm. The cascade canonic form is used, so that the resultant filters can be realized accurately and simply. Design examples are given of low-pass, wide-band differentiator, linear discriminator, and vowel formant filters."
  "It has been shown that recursive digital filters can be synthesized using the fast Fourier transform. An algorithm for computer implementation has been developed and used in comparing the computation times and noise figures of filters synthesized in this manner with the computation times and noise figures of filters synthesized by recursion. A model has been proposed for analysis of noise in the two-pole filter. Predictions of this model have been found to be in good agreement with noise measurements."

"Without contour compensation, music sources appear to have lower bass and treble response at lower volume levels. This occurs because our ears are less sensitive to the extreme frequencies at low-sound levels (Fletcher-Munson effect). This correspondence describes a circuit that compensates for this effect and is compatible with today's integrated circuit amplifier designs."
"A 3-bit differential pulse-code modulation (PCM) system designed for speech was simulated on a computer to determine the quantizer levels which minimize the quantizing noise."
"The speech signal is examined as part of a specific speech communication system. The results of such examination yield the following principles of this analysis. 1) The speech signal must be simultaneously and separately processed for each type of modulation. 2) The different forms of information must be extracted from the result of each detection process, and then combined."
"The problem of low-pass to multibandpass transformation of numerical filters is considered. Properties of frequency transformations are studied and, based on these, a general design procedure is outlined which may be used for obtaining filters with any number of passbands. The procedure is illustrated by means of a ten passband example. A canonic form for realizing bandpass filters is also discussed."

 "This paper redefines and examines the problem of monaural phase distortion in audio systems. Both technical and psychoacoustical aspects of the problem are considered. The redefinition of phase distortion is based upon adopting the acoustical signal at the input of the system as the standard reference. The sources of phase distortion in audio systems are examined with reference to this standard. A review of early and recent psychoacoustic experiments concludes that monaural phase effects can significantly affect the quality of a perceived sound. A signal detection model is used to determine a conservative equivalency between frequency dependent phase distortion and amplitude distortion. It is suggested that a system which maintains a 3 dB tolerance in frequency response should also maintain a 17° tolerance in phase shift. A recent experiment is shown to confirm the conclusion drawn from this model. Absolute phase (polarity error) is evaluated with reference to amplitude distortion in light of recent experiments. It is concluded that at high sound pressure levels absolute phase error is more detectable than 11.5 percent intermodulation distortion. A set of standards for various types of audio equipment is defined, which if implemented would eliminate absolute phase error in audio systems. Finally, the importance of these findings with reference to realism of reproduced sound is commented upon."
"A formant circuit for a speech synthesizer with analog and digital command systems ensuring very good stability and signal-to-noise ratio is described."
"This paper describes experiments in which word recognition is based on comparing the projections of input words on an orthogonal basis with those of a stored library of words. An initial orthogonal basis is determined from the generalized spectrum of short time segments selected from a vocabulary of ten words. The initial basis is optimized by minimizing the complementary error energy. By projecting a spoken word onto the optimum orthogonal basis, a sequence of numbers is generated to represent the word. By correlating the absolute values of the sequence with those of a stored library of words, the spoken word is identified. The percent of correct recognition varies from 71.6 to 96.6 percent for two speakers. Techniques are developed to improve the recognition scores and to reduce the lengthy computer processing time and large storage requirement. First a master template is made for each word by averaging six templates for the particular word. For one speaker the percent of correct recognition increases to 100 percent when incoming words are compared against the master templates. For a second speaker, the recognition rates improve significantly and vary between 93 and 98 percent when the master templates are used. To further improve the recognition process, the feasibility of grouping words into several classes is demonstrated. The classifications are based on the locations of formant regions and the time durations of each spoken word."
"There are many different vocal tract shapes which could produce the same speech signal. One of the parameters of the vocal tract which is not directly available from the speech signal is the length of the tract. A hypothesis is proposed for determining the vocal tract length from a specification of the impedance seen at the lips. Vowel data of Fant [3] are used to test the hypothesis. There is very good agreement between the experimental and predicted values of this length parameter."
"For steady-state waveform analysis, the classical (possibly smoothed) periodogram of the sampled waveform gives one an adequate spectral representation. For transient waveforms of unknown duration in noise, however, the periodogram generally fails in that it is tied to a fixed time interval. As an alternative, a digital computer program which will do time-varying spectral estimation has been developed. Briefly, the program may be described as a digital equivalent of a constant Q-comb filter bank wherein one can vary the frequency range covered and the frequency resolution (i.e., the Q). For a given specified frequency range, as one increases the frequency resolution, the program automatically selects more filters and spaces them so as to cover the specified frequency range; the various contiguous filters are overlapped at the -3 dB points. The instantaneous energy contained in each filter is used to modulate the z axis of a CRT display and hence provide a time-frequency-intensity plot of the time-varying spectrum. Results obtained from the computer program upon real data are given."
"A method of instantaneous automatic compression of large signals, called \"soft limiting\", generates much less harmonic distortion than uncontrolled clipping. If the audible effect of finite-power output (clipping) is prevented, the effect should be the illusion of greater power reserve while reducing manufacturing costs."
 "This paper discusses a new kind of distortion mechanism found in transistorized audio power amplifiers. It is shown that this distortion arises from the multistage feedback loop found in most high-quality amplifiers, provided that the open-loop transient response of the power amplifier is slower than the transient response of the preamplifier. The results of the analysis are verified by measurements from a simulated power amplifier, and a number of constructional rules for eliminating this distortion are derived."
"An experiment was performed in which controlled amounts of slope-overload distortion were produced in specified sections of a test sentence. Preliminary trials showed that the commonly used measure \"percent of time of slope overload\" is not a good indicator of perceptual distortion in delta-modulated speech signals. A more appropriate parameter for specifying slope-overload distortion is the rms slope truncation, which is the rms value of the truncated portion of the time derivative of the signal beyond the maximum absolute slope of the delta modulator. For a 3 kHz low-pass filtered speech signal, the just-perceptible level of distortion for the most sensitive of three subjects was 1.8 quantization units/20 kHz sampling period where 1 quantization unit = 2-11of the peak-to-peak range of the waveform. This figure varied slightly for different speech sounds, but the range of variation was substantially less than the differences between subjects."
"Sound-wave holograms are constructed with sound waves of 10 kHz to 20 kHz by two holographic techniques; the coherent background and the electronic reference methods. The acoustical fields, which are scanned by a microphone and displayed by a lamp, are recorded on films as sound-wave holograms. In the process of reconstructing images from sound-wave holograms, optical and numerical reconstructions are investigated. In the optical reconstruction the images are reconstructed by illuminating the reduced hologram with laser light. The images reconstructed from grating-like holograms constructed in sampling-type holography are discussed. The numerical reconstruction of images is conducted by computer calculation of the digital Fresnel transform of sound-wave holograms using the FFT (fast Fourier transform) method. The analog sound-wave holograms recorded on films are divided into meshes of 64 × 64 cells and each cell is digitized into three levels according to the transparency of the film. The images reconstructed by the optical and the numerical methods are compared and discussed. Theoretical analyses are conducted to explain the experimental procedures and the obtained results."
"This paper is devoted to a discussion of discrete spectrum analysis which is important in applicational areas such as sonar and replica correlation. The discrete Fourier transform is shown to arise naturally as a consequence of finite impulsive sampling and the fast Fourier transform is introduced as the most efficient means of computing the discrete Fourier transform. These are described in terms of parameters pertinent to digital sonar signal processing, including resolution, dynamic range, and processing gain. Computational accuracy is investigated as a function of word lengths associated with the data, kernels, and intermediate transforms for both conditional and automatic array scaling. In real-time equipment, it is frequently necessary to employ some sort of automatic gain control and such a device is investigated here. Results are presented which enable specification of word length and automatic gain control requirements as a function of desired dynamic range, input signal-to-noise ratio, and mean-square error at the quantizer output."
 "Within the last few years, digital techniques have been extensively applied to the solution of signal processing problems. This paper briefly examines the relative merits of analog and digital signal processing techniques and then considers the conceptual issues involved in formulating the solution to a signal processing problem as a digital signal processor. Issues considered are the representation of a digital processor by a difference equation, formal solution of the difference equation, the system function corresponding to the processor, as well as the frequency response of the system."
"There has been an explosive rate of growth of the types and the applications of minicomputers. This growth is a result of employing small computers in a new set of applications that were previously unexploited by the manufacturers of larger computers. To place the emergence of minicomputers in significant perspective, the following analysis is attempted\" 1) typical minicomputer characteristics are outlined, 2) technological reasons for the emergence of minicomputers are suggested, 3) the architecture of contemporary minicomputers is given in terms of hardware structure, instruction format, and input/output configuration, 4) a software system that implements a shared environment on a typical minicomputer system is described, and 5) the advantages of using minicomputers are discussed and representative applications are sketched in the area of testing, control, communication, and laboratory experimentation."
"Using the low-pass filtering properties of a particular new type of analog-to-digital converter, we have developed a numerical filtering method which permits us to obtain, by programming, a large scale of passband filters. The procedure involved is very simple, fast, and consequently very well adapted to real-time treatment. It consists of sampling the analog signal at different rates and then linearly combining the samples thus obtained. These filters have a number of very interesting characteristics: for example, the frequency response curves resemble very closely the response of the basilar membrane. This combination of analog-digital coding and passband filtering seems especially well adapted to the treatment of the speech signal; we are presently applying the method to the problem of real-time speech recognition."
"The transfer function of the vocal tract T(f) is defined as the ratio of the volume velocity at the mouth opening and the sound pressure of the source. In general, this transfer function T(f) can be described by conjugate complex pairs of poles and zeros. This paper describes new efforts in the accurate estimation of the pole- and zero-location (frequency and bandwidth). The procedure is performed by an appropriate computer program. As the spectrum is plotted on a computer display, the human operator is given the possibility to mark areas of interest by light-pen. From the spectrum a first estimate of the frequency and bandwidth is evaluated by calculating the maximum (or minimum) of the transfer function in a given area and the width of its 3-dB slope. A subsequent variation of the frequency and bandwidth leads to an accurate evaluation of the pole or zero location in the s-plane. The variation strategy used by the computer and results are presented in this paper."
"On-line computers offer powerful interactive computing, flexible control of laboratory instruments, and cost economy for a wide range of speech experiments. This paper describes the hardware and software of one such on-line facility which was specially designed for simple self-service operation by speech scientists who are not always computer experts. Examples are given of the use of on-fine facilities for the study of speech analysis, speech synthesis, and speech perception."
"Electronic music has developed in response to sophisticated music listeners' desire for change. The seeds of change arose in the symphonic music of Stravinsky, Schönberg, and von Webern before World War I. Some excellent early analog music was composed by Badings and Varèse at Philips in 1958 and is reproduced on the associated stereo disk. Good digital computer music was composed on the IBM 7090 at the Bell Telephone Laboratories about 1960. An example by Mathews and a 1969 composition on a third-generation computer by Risset is demonstrated. The electronic evolution is affecting the symphonic repertoire and popular music. This paper also discusses and demonstrates recent advances in speech synthesis, including speech analysis and synthesis by the cepstrum method and speech synthesis from printed words by a new process developed in the Bell Telephone Laboratories."
"Following a short introduction to two important principles of adaptive channel equalization, a computer simulation of a complete linear transmission and equalization scheme is presented. The model includes the transmitter, a time-dispersive noise-free channel, and an adaptive receiver based on the minimum mean-square error criterion. The equalization algorithm described in the paper allows the transmission of time-discrete analog data pulses at a speed of 3600 baud or more while following slow time variations of channel characteristics. It is shown how the measured frequency characteristics of real telephone lines can be used in the simulation process. Some examples are given of the convergence time and of the ratio of output signal-to-intersymbol interference noise, both as a function of equalizer length."

"It is shown in this paper that the discrete equivalent of a chirp filter is needed to implement the computation of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) as a linear filtering process. We show further that the chirp filter should not be realized as a transversal filter in a wide range of cases; use instead of the conventional FFT permits the computation of the DFT in a time proportional toN \\log_{2} Nfor anyN, Nbeing the number of points in the array that is transformed. Another proposed implementation of the chirp filter requires N to be a perfect square. The number of operations required for this algorithm is proportional toN^{3/2}."
"The problem of designing nonrecursive digital filters in the frequency domain consists of specifying a finite trigonometric polynomial which has \"good\" characteristics in the context of some application or criterion. Some current design procedures are indirect, in that the polynomial is specified via weighted time-domain sample values. In others, the polynomial is specified directly through its regular complex-amplitude samples. The method proposed here takes the zeros of the polynomial as its defining parameters. It is shown that the asymptotic attenuation rate of the filter can be controlled by adjusting the densities of the pass-band and stopband zeros, and that the \"shape\" of the filter can be adjusted through placement of specific zeros."
"The analysis of arbitrary time samples of signals of interest in terms of a Fourier series in effect forces the signal to be periodic with a fundamental period equal to the sample length. This causes sinusoidal components in the signal that are not harmonic in the sample interval to appear to be discontinuous at the ends of the periods; each such component leads to a complete set of the harmonic terms determined by the analysis. The determination of the inharmonic sinusoidal components can be improved by taking suitable combinations of the coefficients determined by the analysis, or by a weighting of the input data to remove the discontinuity. It is shown that improvements of the convergence are accompanied by a corresponding broadening of the principal response."
"A technique for decomposing a composite signal, which consists of the superposition of known multiple signals overlapping in time, is described. Decomposition includes determining the number of signals present, their epochs (arrival times), and amplitudes. The procedure is investigated for the noise-free and noisy situation. The computation algorithm employs the fast Fourier transform to determine the decomposition filter from a knowledge of the signal waveshape and the specified pulse output. The latter is used to recognize the signal arrival time; the amplitude of which is proportional to the signal amplitude; and the number of such pulses denotes the number of individual signal waveforms that make up the composite signal. Digital data processing problems such as filter realizability, signal resolution capability, the effects of additive noise, frequency (spectrum) compatibility between signal waveform and filter response pulse, and possible additional processing in certain cases are discussed. Applications are decomposition or resolution of signals or echoes in radar and sonar, seismology, brain waves, and neuroelectric spike data. Examples of results are presented for decomposition for noiseless and noisy cases for specified signals. In addition, results are tendered for the decomposition of brain waves evoked by visual stimulation."
"In a recently developed system, involving extensive real-time measurement and digital computation subsystems, each measurement is quality checked to establish reasonableness, edited to remove \"bad\" samples, and filtered to attenuate noise. These functions are achieved under severe restrictions on computer time and storage. The quality of a sample is determined by comparison with a simple prediction, which is used in editing the sample if the original sample is deemed \"bad.\" A five-point recursive filter having optimally selected coefficients for each measurement is employed. Comprehensive tests have proven the acceptability of the smoothing process."
"Two finite Fourier transforms for bandpass signals are developed that require, respectively, a uniform sampling and a quadrature sampling of the signal. In each case the computation can be implemented by a fast Fourier transformation of a minimum (2W) sampling."
"Simple relationships are derived between the main-lobe to side-lobe ratio, the main-lobe width, and the number of elements in a Chebyshev array. These design equations are useful for both transversal digital filters and antenna arrays."
"The Hilbert transformH\\{f(t)\\}of a given waveformf(t)is defined with the convolutionH{\\f(t)} = f(t) \\ast (1/\\pit). It is well known that the second type of Hilbert transformK_{0}{\\f(x)\\}=\\phi(x) \\ast (1/2\\pi)\\cot\\frac{1}{2}xexists for the transformed functionf(tg\\frac{1}{2}x)= \\phi(x). If the functionf(t)is periodic, it can be proved that one period of theHtransform off(t)is given by the H1transform of one period off(t)without regard to the scale of tbe variable. On the base of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), the discrete Hilbert transform (DHT) is introduced and the defining expression for it is given. It is proved that this expression of DHT is identical to the relation obtained by the use of the trapezoidal rule to the cotangent form of the Hilbert transform."
"The problem of optimum analysis of overlapping signals by means of least-square approximation techniques and by linear transformation processes, like resolution enhancement by inverse convolution, is considered. It is shown that optimum accuracy is obtained by employing, before doing a least-square fit, a transformation process which transforms the random noise into white noise. This particularly implies that in any process of artificial resolution enhancement, a loss of accuracy occurs. Examples from the field of spectroscopy are given to demonstrate the achievable accuracy and the requirements with respect to signal-to-noise ratio."
"The digital filtering was proven to be useful in processing convolved signals. In this paper an application of this method in order to improve the resolution of nuclear and magnetic resonance spectra is presented, An emphasis is laid on the possibility of diminishing the noisy secondary effects. The processing was achieved using the FFT algorithm. Some practical results obtained are delivered."
"The structure of systems for the automatic detection of radar echos in interference signals may be derived by the statistical decision theory if the statistical properties of echos and interference are known. The knowledge of the correlation function from fixed targets and weather echoes is of special interest. Photographic records in combination with an oscilloscope are feasible only for a low number of signals and were done for echoes from aircraft. For evaluation of the correlation function with sufficient accuracy nearly 10sdata have to be used. They have to be selected out of a quantity of about (3 ... 5).10sstored data. This large amount of data can only be handled with a computer. A special device (RADICORD) was developed to store the analog radar signal of a usual surveillance radar. The amplitude and phase components are sampled (1 MHz clock rate) and converted into digital words (8 bits). A buffer unit reduces the data rate and makes storage on tape possible. The recorded information is restricted to the signals of targets and small surrounding area by a variable gate. The evaluation is done with ALGOL or FORTRAN computer programs. The method of evaluation depends on the kind of target. Correlation functions and power spectral densities are calculated for two-dimensional targets as ground clutter and weather clutter. Mean values and probability densities of charac, teristic values are computed for single targets as aircraft, helicopters, and bird echos."
"The fast Fourier transform is usually described as a factorization. Recently this has been done in matrix terms. In this paper we present these results in sufficient detail that interested nonexperts can obtain the computer algorithm, and the necessary label permutations. We also count the number of arithmetic operations required in the calculation and point out the well known utility of base 2, both because of mathematical and machine hardware considerations. A simple FORTRAN program based on these ideas is included."
"Correlation of electroencepholographic data recorded simultaneously from several different regions, although promising important insights into the nature of the EEG generating process had been impeded by the prohibitive cost of special equipment or computer time until the introduction of the FFT. Now one is able to analyze the statistical structure of an EEG and explore the biological meaning of its parameters. Power spectra of EEGs in mono- and dizygotic-twins are shown to illustrate how modern techniques can be used to assess the individuality of the spontaneous working EEG. Other examples show the possibility of investigating the relations between simultaneous recordings from different parts of the brain while awake and asleep. EEG analysis is still at its beginning, subject to the data gap between the gross activity from macroelectrodes and the electrical activity from microelectrodes at individual neurons."
"The advent of cheap and fast digital integrated circuits permits, at least in principle, the application of digital processing directly to PCM coded telephone signals. At present, the following applications look most promising: channel filters; digital conference circuits; receivers for MFC or touch-tone signals; and sampling rate conversion. Following a review of these fields, an account is given of the problems which exist specifically in a PCM telephone system."
"Asymptotic expressions are developed to determine the threshold frequency at which sine and tangent Butterworth digital low-pass recursive filters become unstable because of coefficient rounding. Both floating point and fixed point arithmetic is considered. The theoretical threshold values are compared with those obtained through actual operation of the filter on data."
"A common application of the method of high speed convolution and correlation is the computation of autocorrelation functions, most commonly used in the estimation of power spectra. In this case the number of lags for which the autocorrelation function must be computed is small compared to the length of the data sequence available. The classic paper by Stockham, revealing the method of high speed convolution and correlation, also discloses a number of improvements in the method for the case where only a small number of lag values are desired, and for the case where a data sequence is extremely long. In this paper, the special case of autocorrelation is further examined. An important simplification is noted, based on the linearity of the discrete Fourier transform, and the circular shifting properties of discrete Fourier transforms. The techniques disclosed here should be especially important in real-time estimation of power spectra, in instances where the data sequence is essentially unterminated."
"The problem of designing a digital low-pass filter is considered from different points of view, including two approaches which have not received sufficient attention. One approach is based on the prolate-spheroidal-function filters of Slepian, Pollak, and Landau. The other is the incompletely specified least mean-square error (LMSE) method which has been proposed by Rorabacher. We find that, compared with minimax and LSME designs, the prolate-spheroidal digital filters have very low sidelobes, at the expense of more deviation from a flat passband. If a transition band or \"don't care\" region of the frequency response is assumed, then the results of the minimax and LSME methods are nearly the same."

"This article discusses the status of process control digital computers in the chemical industry and traces the growth of their usage during the past eight years. Analog computers for individual loop control are not included. Progress in the use of process control computers in the petroleum industry closely parallels that in the chemical industry. One of the most challenging phases of control systems engineering design in the chemical industry is the application of process control computers. Management is devoting time and effort to considering the use of computers in the control of chemical processes. Many new chemical plants are now being designed with a digital computer included as an integral part of their control systems. It is estimated that process control computers have increased efficiencies 1 to 2 percent and productivity 10 to 20 percent in the 48.6 billion dollar petrochemical industry."
"The development of a nonlinear dynamic model of an industrial process is summarized. The model includes additive stochastic terms and not all the state variables were accessible. Nonlinear state estimation was approximated by a linearized Kalman filter and the control algorithm was from dynamic programming. The development of software and hardware for a remote on-line computer control experiment is then described, in which the industrial plant was connected to a process control computer some 130 miles away by a regular telephone channel."
"This paper demonstrates methods for applying combined optimum control and estimation theory to serial systems with time delay. The case of serial linear systems with time delay is considered in detail; a result analogous to the separation theorem of linear systems is presented. Illustrative examples of serial chemical reactors, rolling mills, and second-order plus dead-time approximations of higher order systems are discussed. Numerical results for a second-order plus dead-time system are presented: these results are compared with a suboptimal feedback controller (modified Smith predictor) and the open-loop response. It is shown that, in this case, the optimum estimation and control gains may be approximated by constants which further simplify the DDC algorithm. In the second-order plus dead-time approximation to higher order overdamped systems, the optimum algorithm can be reduced to recursive estimation with constant gain and linear state variable feed forward control. This algorithm may be used as a direct replacement for digital controllers used in the process industries."
"A metal rolling process is examined, and shown to be an implicit, discrete, multistage, control process with admissible control set dependent only upon the system state. By means of numerical techniques, dynamic programming is applied to this process to generate a closed-loop roll setting policy which is optimal in the sense that it achieves a specified final state at minimum dollar cost. Digital simulation and Monte Carlo techniques are used to compare performance of the optimally controlled mill with that of the the same mill, operating in accord with current rolling practices. Both models are examined using random initial conditions and the process sensors are assumed to contribute noise to the measurement of the system state. An averaging technique is used to decrease the effects of this noise on system performance."
"It is highly desirable to reduce the application period of a computer control system to a hot strip mill. Completion of a hot strip mill computer control system chiefly depends upon the time when slab tracking is operative, and on the setup calculation method and its checking method. For slab tracking, many support programs were devised such as dump, on-line monitor, process input-output simulator, and mill line simulator. To confirm the efficiency of the setup calculation method, a unique checking procedure has been developed and has proven to be quite effective. With these preparations for the installation of a computer control system in Sumitomo's 80-inch hot strip mill, it took only five months in the field to put the full system into operation."
"A computer system is described for real-time data acquisition and servicing of 40 asynchronous inertial guidance system test stations. Some data are received automatically from the small guidance system computers at a maximum rate of eight words per second. Other data are input manually at each station via a mode selector and several 16-position thumbwheel switches. The data are received, partially edited and stored all in real time, and retrieved and analyzed with the highest \"time-availability\" priority at the time of completion of the guidance system test. The analysis results determine further testing or repair actions for each guidance system. The central computer is a SEL 840-MP, a general-purpose 24-bit, 32K, 1.75-µs cycle-time machine with basic real-time monitor software. The special purpose system is implemented as a software/ hardware interface with the real-time monitor and the test station hardware. A key factor for the real-time data processing is the use of random access blocks on mass storage discs to greatly augment primary memory without seriously degrading total accessing time. This also frees \"background\" core for off-line programs running in a low-priority interruptable mode and for the analysis programs which do not operate in the real-time mode. A disc allocation and cataloging scheme is presented along with a hardware and software description."
"The pulp and paper industry is a major one in the United States and utilizes many complex processes. The first control computer was installed in 1961, and the number of installations has increased steadily to about 47 in March, 1969. The applications at many of these installations have been published in some technical detail. This paper briefly describes the processes, many of the control problems and the solutions that have been used. Although the paper deals primarily with the U. S. industry, significant developments abroad are mentioned. Economic and technical results published by companies which have installed 21 of the total computers are summarized."
"The cement manufacturing industry in the United States is described, as are the processing problems which make the utilization of computer control attractive. Computers are being used to assist in the proportioning of raw materials, the operation of the rotary kiln, and in the raw material and product grinding operations. Process measurement and identification problems currently preclude complete automation, but significant economic benefits have been realized and further progress is under way."
"In two areas of major importance to the electric power industry-interconnected system operation and steam-electric energy conversion--on-line computer use has expanded during the past five years to applications of increasing complexity and importance. In systems operation, direct digital control is now in successful operation, and many aspects of system security are now monitored by centralized computers. In generating plants on-line computer use has progressed beyond simple data logging; it currently includes some closed-loop control applications, and will be applied to complete boiler control with assemblies now being installed. Simulation and analysis have played an important role in these advances in the application of on-line digital computers."
"This paper examines the nature of the software which is necessary so that a real-time computer may be used to control industrial processes. The general nature of a process control software system is discussed, and several methods for implementing such a system are examined. This paper is divided into several sections. First, the general structure of process control software systems is examined, and the programming problems associated with developing such a system are discussed. Then several tools for doing this programming are discussed, including problem-oriented languages, \"fill-in-the-blank programming systems,\" procedural programming languages, and the operating systems which are used to tie the different portions of a process control system together.

It will be assumed that the reader is generally familiar with software with at least a passable knowledge of FORTRAN programming."
"Industrial computer control systems require the economical production of efficient software including executive systems, maintenance programs, and both special and general purpose application programs for direct digital control. Moreover, the hardware configuration varies considerably from the single dedicated control computer to a general purpose multicomputer system. RTL, a real-time language developed cooperatively with industrial suppliers and users specifically for industrial control, is described with emphasis on those features peculiar to applications such as dedicated direct digital control, combined direct and supervisory control, operator interfaces, and interaction with plant management computer systems. The use of RTL for the production of special purpose executive systems and general purpose application programs for direct control, startup, etc., is emphasized. Details of the language discussed with examples include its file structure for communication of data bases between independent programs, and a variety of data types including character codes, strings, labels, lists, peripheral variables, and data structures. Peripheral variables are variables in the language associated with hard-ware features of the central processor and its input-output devices such as registers, interrupts, error indicators, and addresses all of which may be referenced in the language. Regular and peripheral variable data structures--combinations of different types of variables--are included and ease considerably the burden of real-time programming. The organization and performance of the existing compiler for RTL is explained."
"The overall objective of the paper is to point out how multilevel concepts and techniques can be applied in the process control field. The approach provides a framework for the structuring and design of a control and management information system for achieving a totally integrated plant automation. The multilevel concepts are classified in terms of strata, layers, and echelons and the use of these concepts in the systems engineering process is discussed. Available techniques and theoretical results are briefly reviewed and the advantages of the multilevel approach in application to large scale systems are enumerated. A number of existing hierarchical installations in industry are briefly described in order to put into practical context the ideas and concepts presented here."
"The general problem of research in the university environment is outlined with specific reference to research in the area of computer control of systems. An approach is presented based on experience with the industrially supported research program at Case Western Reserve University in the control of complex systems. The paper is organized around five aspects of the Case program as follows: 1) definition of scope, research direction, and overall objectives; 2) relationship with students: how a typical study is formulated and carried out; 3) relationship with sponsors: funding and two-way information flow; 4) relationship with the University: the Systems Research Center provides motivation, administrative support, and facilities for interdisciplinary activity; 5) historical development. A specific case history is presented to illustrate some of the above points and, in particular, show how the program has evolved along new directions in response to inputs from members of the group and from the outside community."

"By doping the substrate of a MOST more heavily near the Si-SiO2interface than in the bulk of the semiconductor, an improvement in the transconductance can be achieved.

"This letter discusses a pulse compression technique suggested earlier by Tuttle which modulates the amplitude of a long duration pulse instead of its frequency (as in the \"chirp\" process). The modulation code is that of a zone plate; the echoes are recorded photographically, and then reconstructed optically, as in side-looking radar, thereby circumventing the need for the complicated matched filters of the chirp process."

The best performance achieved was a pulsed output of 68 watts at 630 MHz with an efficiency of 12 percent. Since the diodes are inexpensive and readily available and the mount used was simple to construct, it is felt that this information will open this interesting area of research to those with limited budgets."

"The transient behavior of the electrical and the optical properties under pulse excitation has been studied and analyzed in detail on the electroluminescent devices made of Au-ZnS: NdF3- Ta2O5-Ta composite films. The ZnS-Ta2O5interface is capable of accommodating a large number of trapped electrons, up to 1013cm-2, with the majority of the interfacial states located at a fixed energy below the conduction band of ZnS. Carrier injection is achieved by electrons tunneling through the Au-ZnS Schottky barrier at a field of 2.6×106V/cm. The threshold field of impact excitation for 1 percent NdF3in ZnS was found to be 1.5×106V/cm; while the coefficient of impact excitation at 2.6×106V/cm was estimated to be 1750 cm-1. In addition, the emission time constants of several rare earth fluorides were also studied."
"A solid-state adaptive (analog storage) device with stable electrical characteristics is described and demonstrated. The device is a resonant bandpass electronic filter with adaptable voltage gain; that is, the voltage gain-frequency transfer characteristic can be \"set\" to different values of attenuation by the application of an adapt signal and will retain that \"setting\" after the adapt signal has been removed. Ferroelectric materials are used as the dielectric in a filter structure composed of two capacitors bonded together so that resonant mechanical vibrations established in one (the input resonator) are coupled to the other (the output resonator). Converse and direct piezoelectric effects generate the mechanical vibrations and the output voltages, respectively. Ferroelectric effects in either capacitor provide the analog storage capabilities. The acoustical coupling mechanism employed in the device design results in electrically stable device characteristics. Previous ferroelectric adaptive devices used unstable field effect coupling mechanisms which led to unacceptable device performance. Experimental adaptive resonant filters fabricated with ceramic lead zirconate-lead titanate material compositions are discussed. These filters have electronic Q values near 100 at resonant frequencies in the range 102to 107Hz. The voltage gain-frequency characteristic has a maximum value at resonance of about 0 to +10 dB. Application of a voltage adapt pulse (100 to 300 volts) of low energy (mJ) to either side of the filter can adapt the entire gain characteristic by any value between 0 and about -60 dB within an arbitrary switching time (limited to a practical range of roughly 10+3to 10-4seconds) as determined by the pulse amplitude. Voltage gain settings are electrically stable and can be reproduced by the same or an equivalent sequence of adapting pulses."
"This paper describes diffraction-pattern sampling as a basis for automatic pattern recognition in photographic imagery; it covers: diffraction-pattern generation, diffraction-pattern/image-area relationships, diffraction-pattern sampling, algorithm development (using an interactive computer-graphic based facility), facility description, and experimental results which have been obtained over the last few years at General Motors' AC Electronics-Defense Research Laboratories, Santa Barbara, Calif. Sampling the diffraction pattern results in a sample signature--a different one for each sampling geometry. The kinds of information obtainable from sample signatures are described, and considerations for developing algorithms based on such information are discussed. A tutorial section is included for the purpose of giving the reader an intuitive feeling for the kinds of information contained in a diffraction pattern and how it relates to the original photographic imagery."
"Visualization of isotope distribution within the living body has created important medical diagnostic procedures during the last decade. The static gamma-ray cameras reviewed here are often replacing the earlier mechanical scanners because of their ability to reduce picture exposure times: in extreme cases from minutes to tenths of seconds. Motion picture photography of changing isotope distribution can thus be used to follow many physiological processes which were previously a mystery, and these dynamic studies offer completely new diagnostic methods. This paper reviews the development of static gamma-ray cameras, discusses the problems of their design, and attempts to evaluate the limitations of each type. Methods of judging camera quality are discussed, and there is also brief mention of analytical methods for picture assessment."

"Studies were carried out on a self-scanned image sensor comprising a linear integrated-circuit array of photodiodes and metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistors. It was found that the maximum scanning rate is about 2.5×105bits/s, and that the value is mainly restricted by the photo-induced current and the junction capacitance of the photodiode."
"A solution to the detection Fredholm equation for band-limited noise and signal is presented which makes use of the dual orthogonality and completeness of the prolate spheroidal wave functions. Although data are available only on a finite interval, the detector in principle achieves the same optimum performance as if the interval were infinite. This apparent anomaly is resolved in an example."

First the median of a subsection of signal fading in decibels is found directly from the average of its decibel values over each given time interval; then the long-term fading can be plotted. From such fading data, the statistical properties can be found directly and quickly from the measured level-crossing-rate (LCR) curve."

"Forecasts of the demand for air transportation indicate continued growth in that demand throughout the next 25 years. This paper translates those demand forecasts into measures of air traffic activity--flights, airport operations, and numbers of aircraft airborne at peak periods. Total air traffic activity in this country is projected to increase four-fold between 1968 and 1995. Most aircraft flying in the 1990's are expected to be provided some sort of control service; to serve these users, the capacity of the en route instrument flight-rules system may need to be increased by a factor of about eight. Providing air traffic control services to local and itinerant flights operating to and from all airports within approximately a 30-mile radius of a major terminal might increase tower (or computer) control loads to 10 or 15 times today's peaks."
"Today's major urban airport operates at saturation too frequently but can be upgraded to increase substantially aircraft movement rates by means of a number of system changes. These changes provide for reduced separations between aircraft, use of additional parallels, and more precise control of terminal traffic. There are incremental steps which can be taken to improve the current situation. However, to achieve substantial increases in operating rates with acceptable safety levels, it is necessary to introduce a new landing aid, reconfigure runway designs, use higher quality flight control equipment, and provide ground-air-ground data links and better surveillance for traffic flow organization and conflict monitoring. These features can be used to retrofit current airports or to design new airports. The flexibilities afforded by a new landing system can also reduce noise pollution by permitting flight path geometries not now achievable. The capacity of a single runway can be increased in the near term by approximately 40 percent without changes in current separation standards. In the longer term, it is expected that single runway capacity can be more than doubled with the introduction of improved guidance, flight control, air traffic control automation, and surveillance. Airport acreage can be utilized more efficiently by closer spacing of independent IFR runways."
"The conflicting goals of increasing capacity at an airport and reducing the noise exposure around that airport are examined. Basically, airport capacity is directly related to aircraft noise exposure such that an increase in capacity means an increase in the noise exposed area surrounding the airport. Several technological and operational noise reduction methods are discussed and it is shown that they can reduce the extent of exposure as capacity is increased. Using John F. Kennedy International Airport as an example, it is demonstrated that if these noise reduction methods are utilized, the capacity of this airport can be doubled and community noise exposure can be reduced below current levels."

"A study is made to develop a risk model for airport landing operations. Particular emphasis is placed on simultaneous use of closely spaced parallel runways and on reduction of longitudinal separation on final approach. Based upon certain simplifying assumptions, the missed approach and collision rates are evaluated. For the parameters considered it is found that a safe separation distance for parallel runways is approximately 2500 ft. Further, an acceptable missed approach rate can be maintained if the average spacing at the runway threshold is 62 seconds without speed adjustments on final approach; with some speed adjustments, 55 seconds is sufficient, assuming a runway occupancy time of 40 seconds. A description is given of the type of studies required in order to validate the conclusions suggested by the model."
"This paper reviews the results of a test program utilizing a CW CO2laser-Doppler velocimeter system that has demonstrated the capability of detecting wing tip vortices by the measurement of Doppler shifted back scatter from atmospheric aerosols naturally suspended in the atmosphere. The velocity signatures of vortices generated by a C-47 aircraft making low altitude cooperative flybys are shown. Some considerations of an operational detection system are given."
"The feasibility of reducing the hazards of trailing vortices on closely spaced parallel runways is examined. The proposed solution involves the application of suction along the runways. A simplified computer simulation indicated that the application is feasible and that the required horsepower is modest."
"The actual incidence of midair collisions and near midair collisions in terminal areas between controlled and uncontrolled traffic can be expected to depend on the number of aircraft operations, the relative location and utilization of airports and runways in each terminal, the restrictions on the use of the terminal airspace imposed by topographical features and arrival/departure routes, the incidence of marginal visibility, and the effectiveness of traffic advisories warning of potentially conflicting traffic. This paper shows that the relative incidence of collision exposure in the various terminals, as measured by the number of hazardous near midair collisions reported in these terminals during the 1968 FAA Near Midair Collision Study, is accounted for to a remarkable extent by the relative number of operations and the relative degree to which controlled and uncontrolled aircraft share the same airports. Only a very few specific terminals, where the unequal influence of the other factors cited is believed to be significant, depart somewhat from this finding."
"Using the 1968 FAA near midair collision data and Howell's flight test data on visual detection of aircraft from other aircraft, an estimate is made of the effectiveness of the see-and-avoid doctrine as a function of closing speed in today's air traffic environment. It is estimated that at present about 95 percent of potential collisions are avoided at low closing speeds; this effectiveness of see and avoid falls to about 50 percent above 400 knot closing speed. Midair collisions are found to be primarily attributable to the failure by pilots to see the other aircraft in time to maneuver, and an estimate is given of the potential reduction in anticipated collision rates achievable with the use of pilot warning indicator systems of various degrees of effectiveness. The probability that a pilot reports an NMAC is found to increase as the closing speed of the encounter increases, but it also appears that pilots tend to underestimate the miss distance at the high closing speeds. The estimates made of the probability of successful maneuvers are in good agreement with the independent results of simulation experiments. The expected number of midair collisions in the various closing speed ranges, as predicted from the NMAC and Howell data, are in reasonable agreement with experience."
"The concept of intermittent positive control is to issue commands to normally uncontrolled aircraft only when it is necessary to avoid a hazardous midair circumstance. This concept would depend on a hardware environment which provides reliable location and identification of all aircraft in the protected airspace. A digital computer would use this track and ID information to detect potential conflicts and to calculate commands for transmission to the aircraft which would resolve them. The paper describes a model of the airspace and its use in analyzing the frequency of generated commands. Also, a description of the basic computer algorithm to be used for the conflict detection and resolution function is given."
"A general treatment of collision hazard is developed which expresses the relationship between separation standards, velocity and acceleration limits, surveillance accuracy, communication delays, sampling frequency, maneuver severity, and intervention frequency. An example of separation standards achievable through the use of an upgraded beacon system is given. The relations presented permit optimization of air traffic control systems with regard to collision safety and will permit comparisons between different proposed systems. They should assist in reviewing separation standards when changes in procedures, types of available data, or data accuracy are planned. Further, the procedures outlined could provide real-time assistance in hazard evaluation to the air traffic control process."
 "The frequency of near midair collisions under visual flight rules (VFR) as a function of aircraft density is derived from a model which correlates closely with recent experience. Examples are given which indicate the degree of air traffic control (ATC) needed for safe separation at various levels of aircraft density for both unordered and ordered flight. It is argued that loose forms of ATC such as intermittent positive control can be used safely to prevent collisions while preserving most of the freedom of VFR flight at densities as high as those predicted for peak hours in the Los Angeles basin in 1995."
"The purpose of this paper is to examine briefly the amount of traffic which air controllers can manage with varying levels of automation. It is shown that automated aids to the controller expand his capacity to handle traffic by a factor of 2-3. The use of area navigation and rerouting can increase his traffic handling capacity by another factor of 2-3. Application of both techniques will be necessary eventually to control the traffic forecasted for the 1990's. The contents of this paper are based in part upon a study performed for the DOTATC Advisory Committee entitled \"New York airspace loading and configuration\" [1]."
"Forecast traffic growth for the 1980-1995 time period will exceed the capacity of the present airport and air traffic control automation system in high-density areas. If traffic growth is to be accommodated, higher levels of automation are required. The Department of Transportation Air Traffic Control Advisory Committee (September 1968-August 1969) established a computer sizing group to determine the feasibility of achieving the necessary level of automation within the projected technology. This paper presents a model of the future system, a summary of the functions automated, and estimates of the necessary computer instruction rate and storage requirements as developed by this computer sizing group."
"The air traffic control radar beacon system problems and solutions to these problems are discussed. Residual problems, their extent, and their impact on future systems are described. The results of a system model are related to the possible fixes."
"The beacon subsystem is one of many sources providing information to the air traffic control system. In automatic systems, various types of target information are derived from the beacon replies in a special purpose computer known generally as a processor. An important aspect of processor performance is its ability to detect targets in a noisy environment and to accurately determine the location of these targets. Among the important measures of target detector performance are the false alarm rate, the probability of detection, and azimuth accuracy. The intimate relationship between these three characteristics is described in this paper and specific examples are given using a sequential observer target detector. It is shown that increasing the range resolution of the system also benefits target false alarm rate and azimuth accuracy. Thus, as advances in technology permit improved range resolution, greater overall system performance can be expected. Nevertheless, with current technology, the azimuth accuracy which can be achieved with a statistical detector is better than the azimuth equivalent of one pulse repetition period even in a noisy environment."

"This work addresses data acquisition problems associated with an improved air traffic control system. A mathematical theory of scattering which describes the multipath process is developed. From this model, the optimum signal structure required for ranging and communicating data through the multipath propagation medium is derived. It is shown that the Reed-Solomon Codes have near optimum properties for ranging and data communications. A baseline data transmission system for air traffic control is designed which will accommodate 4000 aircraft per second at the rate of 100 bits per second in a 60 by 120 mile area. The baseline system combines coding with frequency hopping as the best means of combating severe multipath interference. Several coding systems are compared and curves relating error rate to Eb/N0(signal-to-noise energy per bit) for a channel characterized by Rayleigh fading are presented. This paper concludes that a ground-to-air and air-to-ground high capacity data link at a reasonable cost will be feasible for an improved air traffic control system."
"The VOR/DME/TACAN system of short distance navigation in the United States has provided service over the past decade to all civil and military air traffic. Improvements have been incorporated which have been in the nature of refinements, assuring adequate performance for all current aircraft needs. Recent analyses indicate that continued use of VOR/DME to meet increased civil air traffic demands through 1980 will require that the system demonstrate a capability for greater accuracy for terminal area operations, an improvement in signal quality to support area navigation, and the potential for increased traffic handling capacity of the DME component. Development activities now underway indicate that such improvements are feasible. Evaluation results and new techniques are described in support of this conclusion."
"This paper describes an advanced air traffic control surveillance and data system concept. The system is based on the use of satellites in 24-hour inclined, elliptical orbits for both communication and aircraft position determination and communications. Emphasis in the selection of this system was placed on the minimization of user aircraft equipment costs and the centralization of information processing. The future air traffic control problem is discussed, a description of the concept is given, and system performance is analyzed in detail. Models of significance error sources are described. An illustrative satellite design is given as well as cost estimates for the satellites and user equipment."
"The Systems Research and Development Service of the Federal Aviation Administration is actively supporting study and experimental programs that will enable the United States, in conjunction with other participating countries, to achieve by the late 1970's an operational North Atlantic air traffic control system using satellites. No single program or system has been decided upon; however, the following describes one conceptual system which has been formulated. Experiments are planned to test theoretical data which were used in planning system performance specifications. An in-depth study will be required to refine and optimize any conceptual system and to develop specification costs and schedules in sufficient detail to procure hardware."
"A proposed pilot warning instrument based upon the principle of an optical radar is described. Target cross section enhancement, through the use of a passive retroreflector, allows a small semiconductor light-emitting laser diode to act as transmitter. A split scanning beam together with integrated circuit signal processing gives the \"tau\" time of each target thus providing an alarm only in the case of a threat. System parameters are selected to meet a single scan detection probability of 97 percent for targets under minimum visual flight rule conditions while maintaining a \"worst case\" false alarm rate from solar illuminated clouds of less than one per hour. A significant advantage of the system lies in the noncooperative, inherently fail-proof nature of the target enhancement device, the Retro. In any encounter, it is desirable that \"own\" aircraft depend to a minimum extent on the state of repair and adjustment of the \"intruder's\" equipment. The relatively low cost triple mirror array closely fills this requirement."
"An optical-infrared concept is described having applications to a simple, low cost pilot-warning indicator. The system required ultimately should be capable of providing the aircraft pilot with an audible warning and a visual presentation which would give both elevation and relative bearing information on other aircraft. This information would be relative to a fixed reference such as the flight path or the longitudinal axis of the aircraft. The concept investigated is not meant to compete with the automatic collision avoidance system, but should be thought of primarily as a simple and relatively cheap means of providing enhanced collision avoidance capability for general aviation aircraft. The system should be capable of multitarget detection at ranges of at least 2 to 5 miles, with an audible alarm, and should provide the pilot with the directional positions of those other aircraft. With these simplified requirements a cooperative pilot-warning indicator system is being developed, based upon the detection of infrared energy emitted by a light source placed on each aircraft. System concepts will be described, based upon the feasibility of the source-detector combinations investigated. These concepts will ultimately have to consider omnidirectional detection of aircraft equipped with xenon lights, and display concepts applicable to this approach need to be further developed."

"Threshold current and relative output are investigated in the HCN laser when impurity gases such as CO, CO2, and O2, are added."
  "A new type of maser amplifier is described which uses a nonoriented powder as the active material. Because the material is nonoriented, broad absorption bands are present when a magnetic field is applied, rather than narrow absorption lines as in single-crystal material. The broad bands increase the probability that wide bandwidth masers can be developed at reduced cost."

"A retarding-field analyzer was used to investigate the energy conversion and the energy spread of a spiraling electron beam, where the trajectory is generated from a magnetic-corkscrew/magnetic-ramp combination. It was found that in the absence of space-charge effects, the corkscrew will generate a near-rectangular transverse energy distribution from a monoenergetic rectilinear-flow beam. The width of this distribution is independent of the degree of energy conversion but proportional to the beam voltage. The magnetic ramp amplifies both the mean transverse energy and the energy spread linearly."

"Experimental results obtained on metal-silicon Schottky barriers are presented. The investigation concerns the effect of preconditioning the silicon surface prior to metal evaporation, and also the change in barrier height with a post-evaporation heat treatment. The values for a particular metal indicate that the preannealing results in a barrier height closer to that predicted by the Schottky model. Heat treating of the formed diode shows the barrier height approaching the limiting value obtained on cleaved silicon surfaces."

"A laboratory computer is a small- or medium-sized general-purpose machine which has been specially selected to do a particular job. Important economies as well as great computing power are achievable by matching not only the kind of machine, but also the particular set of components to the tasks at hand. For this reason, laboratory computers have become very popular. In addition to selecting the hardware, advantages can be achieved by tailoring the operating system and other general software to the situation. Enough operating systems for such computers have now been written to show how a specific system may be developed by modifying and incorporating features of existing systems and by modifying standard Programs supplied by computer manufacturers. In this way, special systems can be implemented using a reasonable amount of time and effort. This paper provides an introduction to laboratory computer operating systems to serve as a starting point for someone intending to create his own system. Specific systems for a LINC computer, and for the Honeywell DDP-224 and DDP-516 computers are described in some detail. These systems illustrate many features that have been found useful. The documentation needed to use the computer, the size of the user group, and some of the history of development are mentioned. Similar systems can be created to focus new machines on new tasks. Only current state-of-the-art programming is needed. The benefits of such specialization far outweigh the effort and costs."
"A survey of linear-motion electrical machines is presented. Although various types of dc and ac linear machines are briefly mentioned, linear induction motors are the main concern of the paper and they are discussed in considerable detail. Based on topological considerations, a classification of these machines is presented and their development through the last 70 years is reviewed. A brief qualitative description of the newly developed hybrid machine is also included. Analysis and design problems, and some solutions, as unique to linear machines are discussed. Several possible applications of these machines are included."
"A model for the radar cross section (RCS) of the sea has been developed in parallel efforts by scientists in both the United States and the Soviet Union, which is based upon the concept of a composite surface, i.e., one in which a slightly rough surface in the sense of Rice is superimposed on a larger swell structure. For angles off the normal, the model predicts the variation of the RCS with frequency, polarization, and incident angle of the illumination and further predicts an upper bound (saturation value) of the RCS with increasing roughness. The model has been collated with data collected by the Naval Research Laboratory four-frequency radar system in sea states ranging from 0 to 7. The results of the comparison have shown that the upper bound for the RCS exists and is closely approached in windspeeds in excess of 5 m/s. In addition, the data have confirmed the variation of RCS with frequency (UHF to X-band), grazing angle, and with polarization (H, V), provided that the \"tilting\" of the scattering surface by swell is taken into account in the region of shallow grazing angles."
"An economical approach to integrated active RC filter design is described. Complex filter networks are broken down into a series of cascadable second-order filter sections consisting of tantalum thin-film RC networks and semiconductor integrated operational amplifiers. Two building blocks are available for any desired frequency within a decade and for any desired filter function (e.g., low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, band-reject, all-pass, etc.). One building block is for low Q realizations and contains one amplifier; the other is for high Q realizations and contains two. The considerable versatility of this approach is obtained by 1) a network synthesis approach based on decomposing a given second-order function into a low Q asymptotic approximation of this function in cascade with an active frequency emphasizing network and 2) by the characteristics of tantalum and silicon integrated circuits."
"Before high-accuracy graphic displays can be successfully designed or implemented from existing displays, the display distortion need be known to a high degree of accuracy-typically of the order of 0.1 percent of the display area height or better. Present day methods of measuring distortion are clumsy and imprecise. Methods of measurement using moire fringes have been suggested before, but the treatment was intuitive and the interpretation quailtative. In this paper are derived quantitative relationships from which display distortion to the 0.1 percent accuracy mentioned can be obtained using moire fringes. Two distinct methods are described. Full experimental methods, limitations, accuracy of method, etc., are given. Actual case examples illustrate the method. Although the methods developed here were specifically for TV-mode displays, the methods are equally valid for any graphic display device such as cathode-ray tubes (storage or refresh), electromechanical X-Y plotters, flat-screen displays, etc., the only requirement being the ability to display or generate a parallel line pattern. The distortion of graphic input devices such as TV cameras, electronic X-Y input pads, etc., can also be obtained using these methods."

"A design method is presented for achieving wide-band common-mode rejection (CMR) in discrete or integrated differential amplifiers.

It is also shown that these filters may be realized by the same structure with Y1and Y2interchanged. These realizations possess minimum sensitivity with respect to the amplifier gain."

"An introductory discussion is presented in the general field of detection theory, with particular emphasis on the problems of detecting signals in Gaussian noise and of estimating parameters of signals in Gaussian noise."
"This paper considers some of the simpler nonparametric detection schemes and compares their asymptotic relative efficiencies to those of detectors which are optimal in the Neyman-Pearson sense. In the one-input case, the nonparametric sign and Wilcoxon detectors are compared to the linear detector which is optimal for the detection of a dc signal of unknown amplitude in Gaussian noise. For two-input systems the nonparametric polarity coincidence correlator is compared to the system which is optimal for the detection of a common random Gaussian component in two-input Gaussian noises. The nonparametric detectors are shown to offer advantages in simplicity of implementation and in insensitivity to changes in input statistics while performing moderately well compared to the parametric detectors. More impressive results can be obtained with more complicated detectors utilizing nonlinear rank statistics."
"This paper illustrates by using a simple coin-tossing example how the new discipline of decision analysis sheds light on the perennial problems of inference, decision, and experimentation. The inference problem is first discussed from the classical viewpoints of maximum likelihood estimation and hypothesis testing, and then from the viewpoint of subjective probability and Bayesian updating. The problem is next placed in a decision setting to demonstrate how an estimate is related to the nature of the loss structure. Experimental possibilities are evaluated for the case where the size of the experiment must be determined a priori and for the case where experimentation can cease at any point. The decision-analysis philosophy allows consideration of all these problems within one philosophical and methodological framework."
"Error calculations cannot be carried out precisely when parameters are estimated which affect the observation nonlinearly. This paper summarizes the available approaches to studying performance and compares the resulting answers for a specific case. It is shown that the familiar Cramér-Rao lower bound on rms error yields an accurate answer only for large signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). For low SNR, lower bounds on rms error obtained by Ziv and Zakai give easily calculated and fairly tight answers. Rate distortion theory gives a lower bound on the error achievable with any system. The Barankin lower bound does not appear to give useful information as a computational tool. A technique for approximating the error can be used effectively for a large class of systems. With numerical integration, an upper bound obtained by Seidman gives a fairly tight answer. Recent work by Ziv gives bounds on the bias of estimators but, in general, these appear to be rather weak. Tighter results are obtained for maximum-likelihood estimators with certain symmetry conditions. Applying these techniques makes it possible to locate the threshold level to within a few decibels of channel signal-to-noise ratio. Further, these calculations can be easily carried out for any system."
"The central issue in detection theory is that of detecting known or random signals in the presence of random noise. The detailed problem description depends on the physical situation of interest. In most of the original work on detection theory the random processes were modeled as Gaussian processes and characterized by their covariance function. In many cases the solution for the optimum detector is expressed in terms of an integral equation which is difficult to solve. In this paper we demonstrate how to formulate and solve detection theory problems using state-variable techniques. These techniques enable us to obtain complete solutions to almost all problems of interest. In addition, they offer new insights into the problems. We first formulate our basic state-variable model for real and complex random processes. We then study five applications of state-variable techniques. The first application is in the solution of linear homogeneous Fredholm equations. This problem arises whenever we want to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunction of a random process. The second application is the detection of a slowly fluctuating point target in the presence of colored noise. The third application is the detection of Gaussian processes in Gaussian noise. The fourth application is detection of Doppler spread targets and communication over Doppler spread channels. In the final application, we introduce distributed state variables in order to study the detection of doubly spread targets. The goal of the paper is to demonstrate the importance of state-variable techniques in a wide variety of detection theory problems."
"An examination is made of the basic principles and results of the theory of detection and estimation of signals in noise, which is not limited to the condition that the useful signal and noise be Gaussian and that the noise be additive. Formulas are obtained [(23) and (25)] for likelihood ratios which are useful in the Markovian as well as in the non-Markovian case. The results are specialized for the case of diffusion noise and fixed but unknown signal parameters, when it is possible to effectively utilize the theory of conditional Markov processes. Estimation by the quasi-linear theory is also discussed, the applicability of which is limited not by the Markovian condition, but by the condition of high a posteriori accuracy. In conclusion, a generalization is given of the theory for the case of adaptive detection and estimation, when the a priori information is replaced by learning. In this case, application of the theory of conditional Markov processes makes it possible to obtain, besides the previous equations of Gaussian approximation, similar equations for the unknown parameters."
"Given a stochastic process, its innovations process will be defined as a white Gaussian noise process obtained from the original process by a causal and causally invertible transformation. The significance of such a representation, when it exists, is that statistical inference problems based on observation of the original process can be replaced by simpler problems based on white noise observations. Seven applications to linear and nonlinear least-squares estimation. Gaussian and non-Gaussian detection problems, solution of Fredholm integral equations, and the calculation of mutual information, will be described. The major new results are summarized in seven theorems. Some powerful mathematical tools will be introduced, but emphasis will be placed on the considerable physical significance of the results."
"An approach to the general problem of detecting and extracting signals from random media with the help of multichannel (i.e., multidimensional) receivers is described, based on standard decision theory methods and stressing the key role of channel physics and geometry. The principal aim is to provide an illustrative outline of a unified treatment, emphasizing the interdisciplinary character of the methods used and the critical nature of the channel model for both optimal and suboptimal systems. Included is a discussion of system apertures (arrays), the dynamical equations of propagation in elastic media and for electromagnetic phenomena, scattering, ambient (self-) noise fields, preformed and adaptive beams, Poisson and Gaussian field statistics, and general methods for obtaining the statistical description of noise and signal fields. Two illustrative examples of some recent results are briefly considered, and a number of important current problems are described, whose solutions depend on the approach developed here."
"The accurate estimation of both discrete and continuous parameters of speech signals has played a central role in speech processing and research. Interestingly, the most successful estimation procedures have often relied on intuition based on knowledge of speech signals and their production in the human vocal apparatus rather than routine applications of well-established theoretical methods. This experience in speech processing should serve as a reminder that a thorough understanding of the signal is paramount for successful analyses of real-world processes."
"The paper reviews how current developments in detection theory have contributed to our understanding of human sensory processes. The first section of the paper emphasizes the methodological contributions of detection theory and how the theory is useful in the analysis of discrimination data. Next, a brief discussion of the substantive contribution of the theory in auditory research is considered. Energy detection, internal and external fluctuation, and some recent work using a Poisson model, illustrate these substantive applications of detection theory."
"The pattern of all-or-none firings in many sensory nerves can usefully be modeled as a set of sample functions from non-stationary random processes whose parameters are determined by the sensory stimulus. Given such a description, one can compare the parameter estimation, discrimination, or detection performance of a human observer (as measured behaviorally) with the computed limiting performance of an ideal observer operating on the same neural input. Such a comparison is carried out in detail for the discrimination in frequency of an auditory sinusoidal tone burst. The results suggest that the human listener behaves as if he ignored (at least for this class of sounds) the periodicity information in the auditory nerve pattern (resulting from the phase-locking of the firings to the stimulus), but made full effective use of the place information (resulting primarily, although not entirely, from the mechanical tuning of the inner ear). On the other hand, it is known that the auditory system can discriminate certain more complicated stimuli on the basis of periodicity information if that is the only cue available. A modification of the structure of an optimum sinusoidal frequency discrimination system is conjectured that seems to be, at least qualitatively, consistent with the available evidence."
"Certain sequential tests of statistical hypotheses known as sequential probability ratio tests (SPRT) possess an optimum property that they can accelerate, on the average, the termination of the test or alternately execute the test in the same time with less error, or with the same error but on less distinguishable hypotheses than a fixed sample-size test. These properties are of practical importance when applied to the radar problem, but in the application of sequential methods to radar surveillance some modification of an SPRT is frequently necessary. In particular, design problems relating to phased array radars are considered. This paper reviews the problem of angle search constraints, existence of multiple resolution elements in range and velocity, possibility of a flexible allocation of pulses, and fluctuations of radar cross sections of targets. Representative numerical results are included to indicate what performance can be expected with the use of sequential methods. An attempt is made to present an integrated theoretical and practical picture. Key references are listed."
"A review is given of detection and estimation methods in current use in radio and radar astronomy. Methods of determining position and brightness distribution of radio sources by narrow-beam antennas, interferometry or lunar occultations are discussed. Observational procedures for the estimation of frequency spectra are explained. The fundamental problem in radar astronomy, viz., that of mapping, is reviewed, and several methods for the removal of ambiguities are considered. Schemes for the determination of range and velocity of a planet are also described."
"The statistical theory of signal detection and estimation has been applied to problems in large array seismology. Using this theory the structure of the optimum detector for a known signal and long observation time in additive Gaussian noise is derived. The array processing filter employed by the optimum detector is known as the maximum-likelihood filter. This filter also has the property that it provides a minimum-variance unbiased estimate for the input signal when it is not known, which is the same as the maximum-likelihood estimate of the signal if the noise is a multidimensional Gaussian process. A series of experiments was performed using data from the large aperture seismic array to determine the effectiveness of the maximum-likelihood method relative to simpler methods such as beam-forming. These results provide significant conclusions regarding the design and processing of data from large seismic arrays. The conventional and high-resolution estimation of the frequency-wavenumber spectrum of the background microseismic noise is also presented. The diffuse structure of this spectrum is shown to aid in explaining the relative performance of array processing methods."
"A mathematical solution to the problem of optimum radar target detection and parameter estimation in receiver noise and heavy clutter has been achieved by means of space-time decision theory. The theory leads to a conceptual design for an antenna processing system that is optimum in the sense that it makes least risk parameter estimates and least probability of error decisions. The system can be instrumented by separately demodulating the individual radiator outputs and feeding them simultaneously and in parallel to a digital computer, Hypothesis testing problems such as target detection are formulated by means of a generalized likelihood ratio test. Optimum mean-square estimation is carried out by instrumenting the mean of the parameter in question conditioned on the observed signal. With the aid of a priori statistics available or assumed, the a posteriori likelihood function is derived. From this function, the required generalized likelihood ratio hypothesis tests and parameter estimators are synthesized. Specific illustrations include systems for detection and angular location estimation for one or two targets in a clutter environment. Optimum tests as well as optimum and suboptimum estimators are realized as flow diagrams for computation by the special-purpose digital processor."
"The optimum detector under a fixed delay constraint D is derived for channels having memory and additive noise. The resulting receiver is recursive and does not grow with the message length. Its structure is presented for linear channels (AM and PSK) with known (or estimated) impulse response and noise statistics. The intersymbol interference is assumed to extend for L sampling periods and the receiver is allowed a \"look-ahead\" at D future received samples. Simulation results using actual channel characteristics show the detector to outperform a transversal equalizer even for relatively small values of D."

"The turn-on delay time of silicon p-n-p-n switches has been experimentally shown to be inversely proportional to gate currents in excess of the threshold value. Based on the measurements of bidirectional p-n-p-n switches, it is demonstrated that p-n-p-n structures with remote gating have inherently longer turn-on delay times than those of the conventional construction having the gate lead attached to a base region."

"A unified theory from which the design of a large class of coherent digital communication systems can be optimally carried out is presented. In the design of digital communication systems, the error rate is the criterion which is invariably emphasized. In many digital systems, however, there is relative motion between transmitter and receiver which must be estimated by making use of Doppler frequency information. A new analysis of a general class of coherent digital systems is herein developed, in which the tradeoffs that exist between Doppler measurement capability and bit demodulation error rate are quantitatively presented. The theoretically unrecoverable power loss which exists when employing frequency division multiplexing subcarriers as compared to time division multiplexing is described. The results point out that there is significant parametric dependence of the optimal choice of system parameters on the carrier loop signal-to-noise ratio and the data rate."
 "A method of determining the relative constitutive parameters (µr, εr) is given. This method is based on the Mie solution of a scattering sphere. Field components scattered in two orthogonal planes are measured at 6.17 GHz and 7.03 GHz to calculate the desired parameters of four representative specimen spheres each 1.27 cm in diameter. A consistency process has been developed to reduce random errors caused by theoretical approximations and experimental inaccuracies. Only those data which are considered to have given consistent solutions are then used to produce the material parameters. A target support which can be rotated 360° is used to determine whether a specimen sphere can be assumed homogeneous and isotropic. The present method has in practice no difficult problem of specimen fitting and positioning. Semiquantitative assessments on the final results of (µr, εr) are made for the specimens measured. Usefulness of this method for measuring lossy materials is demonstrated by the use of three lossy specimens. Recommendations for evaluating a unique set of parameters and improving their accuracies are made in both theoretical and experimental aspects."

"In this tutorial paper we consider the problem of the transmission of data from a general class of information sources over a general class of communication channels. The problem is the determination of the maximum attainable value of a (suitably defined) \"reliability.\" In general the channel imposes limits on the attainable reliability in three ways: 1) by introducing \"noise\" into the system, 2) because of a \"mismatch\" between source and channel (for example, an analog data source and digital communication channel), and 3) because of \"costs\" associated with various channel inputs (for example, signal \"power\"). We assume that the system designer is allowed to interpose data processors between the source and channel input; and between the channel output and the user (called \"encoder\" and \"decoder,\" respectively) to combat these limitations. Shannon's coding theorem, which is the subject of this paper, gives an answer to this question of maximum reliability in the special case where no limit is imposed on the complexity of these processors. Since this is a tutorial paper, we emphasize motivating material and discussion at the expense of mathematical details and proofs."

"This paper traces the development and regulation of cable television from the early 1950's to the present. It illustrates the increasing impact on broadcasting of expanding cable capacity and the Federal Communications Commission's regulatory response thereto, including the requirement of carriage and nonduplication of local signals, and regulation of the importation of distant signals. It considers the Commission's pending regulatory proposals, as well as proposed Congressional revision of the copyright law. It outlines the Commission's efforts to encourage the cable industry to provide true diversity of programming through local origination and leasing of channels to others, as well as the relationship between CATV and the telephone industry, and the Commission's efforts to prevent the latter from abusing its control of the poles which are normally essential to cable operation. Finally, the paper looks briefly at the future of cable regulation."
"The growth of CATV or cable television has often been characterized as \"explosive.\" Since 1952, the first year in which reliable statistics were accumulated, the number of CATV systems have multiplied 35 times and it is now estimated that over 4½ million families are receiving CATV service from approximately 2350 cable TV systems. This growth is especially impressive when it is considered that the CATV industry, whose very existence has depended upon the existence and viability of the TV broadcast industry, has been locked in a bitter struggle with that industry throughout most of its 21-year history. Unquestionably the two most important factors influencing the growth and posture of the CATV industry today have been the uncompromising demands of the public for a greater diversity in choices of TV programming than the broadcast industry has been able to provide, and the competitively motivated opposition, vigorously prosecuted before congressional committees and the FCC. This has resulted in a series of investigations and Reports and Orders by the Federal Communications Commission that have produced a comprehensive regulatory scheme designed by the Commission to maintain CATV as a supplementary service to broadcasting, and conversely to protect the broadcast industry, particularly UHF broadcasting, against any adverse economic impact by CATV that would endanger the viability of the broadcast service. Whether or not this concern is economically justified and if so, the nature and extent of regulation necessary, were the principal contentions between the two industries over the years. The first formal rules became effective in 1965 but were applicable only to cable systems using microwave radio relay services. In subsequent years the Commission was able to establish firmly its jurisdiction over the entire CATV industry and the Commission's rules and policies has now evolved to the point that virtually all cable television developments in the top 100 television markets have stopped. The Commission has, however, been the subject of increasing criticism from outside the CATV industry for its restrictive CATV regulatory policies. This criticism appears to be effective and more recent actions of the FCC indicate that it clearly recognizes an exciting potential for cable technology in furnishing a variety of television and other communication services between homes, businesses, and information libraries. The critical issues today are how to secure the optimum services from both the broadcast and cable technologies."
"Raymond Williams has usefully distinguished among communication systems according to how easy it is for potential users to gain access to communications media. In this paper Williams' concepts are applied to an analysis of the television system in the United States. In addition, proposals for social applications of television which require a greatly expanded channel capacity are noted, and considerations involved in comparing the costs of wire and over-the-air systems are raised."
"The increasing capacity of CATV systems has generated a demand for more program material than can be economically generated with local facilities. A possible solution is a nationwide satellite distribution system dedicated to CATV which would provide the additional material directly to the CATV head-end. This paper presents a satellite system design that would distribute six TV channels to 10 ft antenna terminals located at the head-end. Since such a system requires thousands of receiving terminals, their cost must be minimized to produce an economically viable system. The system addressed in this paper requires a ground terminal that is comparable to a standard microwave relay terminal in both cost and complexity. The system consists of three satellites, covering the Eastern, Central, and Western portions of the United States. Based on tradeoffs of spectrum availability and low-noise amplifiers, the 12 GHz frequency band has been selected for the satellite to terminal link. The proposed terminal uses a fixed high-efficiency 10 ft antenna with extremely simple but rigid construction. A low-cost tunnel diode amplifier is used for the receiver front end. After the necessary down-conversion, detection of each channel is performed at the standard 70 MHz IF frequency. The required satellites could be launched on an Atlas Centaur launch vehicle using present technology. The satellites would weigh an approximate 1500 Ib and generate 5 kW of dc power."
"Cable television (CATV) is unique in that it is the only wire, besides telephone, with potential access to 80 million customers. Many new services have been proposed to utilize this access-from meter reading to transmission of an entire book in seconds. The author postulates that electronic mail is the market CATV should pursue and describes the market potential, a system design in some detail, and an estimate of the costs involved. An intriguing result of this analysis is the possibility of sending mail electronically for only 10 cents a letter."
"Cablecasting offers the possibility of a new and improved system of color television. New technology for wide bandwidth, for large displays, and better signal transmission systems make it desirable to improve on the National Television System Committee (NTSC) system which has served so well for over-the-air transmissions. In this paper, a system is suggested with which a subscriber owning a present TV receiver Will continue to get the same picture quality as he does now. New receivers can be designed to provide substantially improved resolution and better color reception. The system uses two adjacent 6-MHz channels for each one now used. The upper channel is standard NTSC, while the lower channel is filled with a lower sideband that permits a 7-MHz video response, Present receivers use the upper channel, while new receivers will use signals from both channels."
"A new concept in cable television systems is described in which the general form of the network is similar to the local distribution network of a telephone system. Each television set is provided with an individual connection to a program exchange where the subscriber may select, by means of a remotely operated switch, the program of his choice from the unlimited number of programs available at the exchange. The system is based on the technology of HF multipair cable television systems extensively used in Great Britain. The system is flexible in use and the facilities for two-way transmission, subscription TV, audience rating, etc., are explained."
"This paper analyzes the restrictions on the bandwidth of a system carrying a multiplicity of modulated signals, if all second-order beats are to occur outside the band. This is of particular interest in cable TV systems where the signals are frequently assigned to two bands separated by a \"mid-band\" where no signals are assigned."
"A ditigal pulse code modulator (PCM) system is proposed to implement long-haul video system for the CATV industry. A comparison is made between PCM system and wide-band FM system in terms of repeaterability versus additional occupied signal bandwidth. This is followed by a noise analysis of coaxial cable to determine the correct PCM format and bit information rate. An 80- megabit system is selected, which uses an 8-bit code in a four-level, eight-level, eight-level pulse sequence per video sample. The selected PCM system is then evaluated for its performance on both a long-haul cable system and a long-haul microwave system. Performance calculations are made on a 500-mile cable system in terms of error rate and its related video signal-to-noise ratio. Repeater spacings are computad for various configurations, including the replacement of the digital regenerators with analog amplifiers. Additional performance calculations are then made on a 3000-mile microwave system, including the effect of simultaneous Rayleigh fading."
"This paper presents a study of the structural return loss (SRL) phenomenon pertaining to coaxial cables. Basic equations are developed, the effect of periodic changes in the physical structure of the cables is analyzed, measuring principles and techniques are discussed, and a method of fault location using the SRL test technique is given."
"It is well known that in a CATV trunk line, where all amplifiers are spaced for identical gain and all have the same noise figure and distortion characteristics, the individual amplifier gain resuiting in the longest usable system is one napier (8.69 dB). The gain of amplifiers used in CATV today is usually near 20 dB. This paper attempts to develop two reasons why the optimum gain in a real situation is higher than the ideal number. 1) The operating levels in a real system have an inevitable uncertainty which increases with the number of amplifiers used. 2) The noise figure and distortion performance of real amplifiers are dependent on the gain, with higher gain amplifiers generally having better performance in these respects."
"There are several techniques available for the transportation and distribution of multichannel television signals or, for that matter, multicarriers of any kind, involving the use of repeater amplifiers. One such technique uses push-pull amplifier equipment and, avoiding the pros and cons of the various methods, this paper briefly discusses some of the advantages of push-pull amplifiers and treats in detail the second-order distortion in such amplifiers. A mathematical model of a push-pull amplifier is designed and various manipulations are performed on the model in order to determine its behavior in relationship to a design goal of -66 dB for second-order beats. Practical amplifiers are built and measurements are performed, with the results confirming the theory."
"This article concerns itself with comparison of transistor amplifier configurations in relation to their cross-modulation distortion characteristics. Only the base-emitter junction nonlinearity is considered, since this nonlinearity is considered to be the most significant contributor to cross-modulation distortion. For this case investigations have shown that since cross modulation occurs because of a third-order nonlinearity, the cross-modulation distortion is therefore proportional to the square of the interfering voltage which appears across the base-emitter junction. In this article the cross modulation of the transistor stage is analyzed from its equivalent circuit rather than from the theoretical device characteristics, It is assumed that the transistor stage gain and input impedance remain relatively constant with small signal voltage excursions. Using these hypotheses, a figure of merit factor is derived for comparison of transistor and transistor amplifier configurations with respect to their cross-modulation distortion characteristics. This figure of merit factor is then used to compare the relative cross-modulation susceptibility of the common collector, common emitter, and common base configurations. All three configurations are compared in the hypothetical voltage-generator and short-circuit load case. The derivation of the equations is shown in Appendix I. For this case it is shown that the three configurations have equal figures of merit. The latter two configurations are then analyzed and compared for the more practical matched input and matched output (maximum power transfer) case. Familiar formulas for transistor gain and input impedance in the low-frequency equivalent model are used for this analysis. Derivations of the equations are shown in Appendix II. The effect of feedback on the cross-modulation figure of merit is then analyzed using both degenerative and regenerative types of feedback. It is then shown that by use of the analysis of the low-frequency model, together with the analyses of the effects of feedback, a high-frequency analysis of cross-modulation figure of merit can be made. This analysis is most applicable to wide-band VHF amplifiers, such as used in Community Antenna Television trunk cascades. A convenient means for analysing cross modulation in the more complicated high-frequency circuit is thus described. Other types of stages, such as push-pull and parallel outputs, are also discussed in regards to the defined cross-modulation figure of merit. A set of conclusions concerning the defined cross-modulation figure of merit is then reached."
"Assuming that the transfer characteristic of the amplifier can be represented by a power series with three terms, an analysis is carried out to determine the frequency and amplitude of each distortion component. To make it easy to apply these results to a practical situation, the necessary constants are defined to enable expressing these relationships in decibel terms. The results are simple expressions which involve adding or subtracting decibel constants from products of the output levels, in dBmV, by integers. Cross modulation, compression, and differential gain are treated, as well as the various harmonics and beats. The usefulness of these results in practice is discussed, as well as the extent of agreement which can be expected between theory and practice."
"The cable television industry is in the process of developing appropriate instrumentation and techniques for reliably measuring system performance. Data and waveform oscilloscope trace photographs obtained in actual performance tests in the field at Charleston, W. Va., are included in this paper with discussion of methods and results. Ample room for improvement both in test equipment and technique is needed."
"This paper discusses the waveform approach to television signal assessment and the television K rating, with special reference to demodulator design where it is necessary to apply and use the time-variant test waveforms. Steady-state measurements alone cannot give the necessary information on television waveform distortion. The results obtained on new modulator-demodulator equipment are described."
"An investigation of the cross-modulation performance of UHF power transistors and its correlation with the gain parameter curves S21(IC, VCB) shows that such transistors today exhibit an inherent linearity limitation and are not optimized for ultralinear applications. This means that using higher power transistors does not result in a larger output signal with low cross-modulation distortion. Presented measurements clearly demonstrate that the nonlinear products increase, not only with increasing emitter dc current, but also with collector voltage above certain limiting values ICLand VCL, respectively; ICLand VCLare relatively small compared with the corresponding maximum permissible values of ICand VCB. Their existence can be explained by current crowding effects, by the space-charge limitation of the collector current, by the nonuniform thermal conductance, by the temperature gradients, and by the unequal current density distribution across the (large) active areas of power transistors. A correlation between the VCgain parameter falloff effect and the \"thermal distortions,\" has been established. Design and selection criteria for ultralinear transistors needed in CATV amplifers are given. A simple linearity test method is described."
"A rigorous approach permits a co-channel filter design which effectively removes the beat interference of a weaker, but still noticeable, TV station on the same channel as a desired station. Unlike previous designs, the present filter does not rely on the strength or direction of the interfering station. Rather, it uses a novel multi-frequency, multipath, phase reversal technique to accomplish cancellation of the bandpass containing the beat interference without accompanying phase distortion, as occurs in conventional filters. The co-channel filter, designed to be used after demodulation to base-band, is equipped with a meter at the beat frequency for proper adjustment of the frequency and notch depth controls."

Conventional structures (p+nn+or n+pp+) are essentially single-drift-region devices in that transit-time delay (for IMPATT mode) and zone transit (for TRAPATT mode) occur in a single region of one impurity type. The proposed structure (p+pnn+) has two drift regions and is essentially two complementary avalanche diode oscillators in series."

In the latter discussion capacitive up-converters, and diode, FET, and transistor mixers are dealt with."
"Recent advances in silicon nitride deposition techniques have led to the emergence of the metal-nitride-oxide-silicon (MNOS) integrated circuit technology as an alternative and supplement to the existing MOS technology. Applications of MNOS field-effect transistors have been proposed for both logic circuits (as an alternative to MOS transistors) and nonvolatile memory arrays This paper reviews the characteristics and applications of MNOS transistors. It presents a unified approach to the characterization of both stable and variable turn-on voltage MNOS transistors. The analysis is based on an extensive investigation of charge transport and storage in MNOS structures. The different modes of transistor operation are described and analyzed in terms of the physical parameters of the two-layer dielectric structure. Understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying transistor operation is applied to the optimization of transistor structure and performance for different digital integrated circuit applications. The feasibility of these applications is demonstrated by fabrication of a nonvolatile semiconductor storage array and a nonvolatile flip-flop."
"A feasibility study has shown that Bi4Ti3O12can be used to form a matrix-addressed display possessing gray scale and capable of operating at TV speed and resolution. As compared with other matrix-addressed schemes, the Bi4Ti3O12display has the advantages of high contrast and brightness, low power, no interface connection problems, and a separation of the switching and display functions. The disadvantages are that the elements are size-limited and require high drive voltages, and that it is necessary to fabricate long crystal bars possessing very good dimensional, electrical, and optical uniformity. The unique electrical and optical properties of ferroelectric Bi4Ti3O12suggest that the material could be used in applications other than the proposed display mode. Consideration has been given to using Bi4Ti3O12as an optical selector, in conjunction with a photoconductor to form an optical storage medium, as a matrix-addressed memory, for a transcharger-electroluminescent display, as a bar graph, and as an optical slit."
"Two novel schemes for guiding acoustic surface waves along curved paths on isotropic substrates are described. One involves the deposition of a slowing film of graded thickness along the intended path on a dielectric substrate. Paraxial-ray equations are developed to describe the ray paths adjacent to the axis of the guiding film, which are determined by the slowing factor resulting from a variable-thickness deposited film. Diffraction is taken into account through an approximation developed by Pierce for optical beams. It is shown that very thin films are sufficient for a substantial amount of directional control. The other guidance system employs a series of lenses in analogy with the lens guides developed for millimeter waves and optical beams. Some comments are made about thin-film lenses and the theory is developed for the focusing action of a lens formed by a spherical depression in (or protrusion from) the surface of a substrate. A simple analog for determining ray paths over generally nonplanar surfaces is described and applied to nonspherical depressions to evaluate their focusing properties."

The properties of these waves suit them for use in a number of applications, which are discussed, ranging from realization of electronic amplifiers, frequency and analog time-domain filters, and coding devices, to the modulation of light beams and the measurement of surface properties of solids. Many references to the recent surface-wave literature are included."

"A compact optical-tactile reading aid that allows a blind person immediate access to virtually all printed reading material used by sighted people has been developed. A singular feature of this instrument is a silicon monolithic image-sensing array that serves as the \"retina\" of the reading aid: signals from the retina are used to control an array of piezoelectric stimulators that form tactile images of printed characters. The image sensor consists of a 24×6 matrix of bipolar phototransistors integrated on a chip approximately 3×5 mm in size, and is designed on the basis of electrical, optical, psychological, and psychophysical considerations. The column-isolated structure incorporates a 2 to 1 aspect ratio to provide sufficient resolution and field of view for unambiguous letter-by-letter detection using a minimum number of sensor elements. A one-dimensional scanning technique minimizes fixed pattern noise and reduces the complexity of the total system. The individual 150×300 µm photosensing elements are optimized for maximum responsivity, uniformity, and dynamic range. The doping profile, featuring a 2 µm base depth and 12 µm epitaxial thickness, is based on spectral response and on a detailed electrical analysis of array operation. Output nonuniformity is minimized, and electrical crosstalk is virtually eliminated by designing for hFE≥ 200 and CTC/CTE≥ 5. Array performance correlates well with the predicted characteristics and has led to improved reading speeds greater than 50 words per minute."
"The extraction of a coherent reference for purposes of demodulating double-sideband suppressed carrier (DSB-SC) signals can be accomplished using either a squaring loop or a Costas loop. By means of the Fokker-Planck equation, this paper establishes the tracking performance of these two circuits in the presence of frequency detuning, and then applies the results in evaluating the performance of coherent demodulators of digital (coded or uncoded) data. The results are sufficiently general to assess the effects of a broad class of prefiltering characteristics on tracking performance, as well as the effects due to various loop filter mechanizations. An expression for the moments of the time to first loss of synchronization is also given."
"The methods now in the literature for calculating the terrain-backscattered radar-altimeter echo utilize the antenna power-gain patterns and the terrain radar cross section per unit area, usually designated σ0. In this paper, the polarization characteristics of the antennas and the echo depolarization by the terrain are taken into account for the first time. The formulas for the backscattered return are presented in terms of antenna and terrain parameters that can be measured directly or calculated from other measurements. These parameters are the four transmitting- and receiving-antenna gain patterns for the orthogonal polarization components, the two functions giving transmission- and reception-phase difference between the polarization components, the terrain-depolarization factor that accounts for the average backscattered power cross polarized with respect to the incident wave, and the radar cross section σ0per unit area. It is shown that the older formulas used for radar return from the near vertical are correct only when both antennas are linearly polarized and have the same direction of polarization. The errors that result from failure to consider polarization effects are illustrated by examples."
"The annealing of radiation-produced defects in semiconductor devices is discussed briefly for60Co gamma-ray and 1-MeV electron damage, and in detail for fast-neutron damage. The effects on the reordering processes of varying the material parameters and the irradiation conditions are considered. Transient annealing of neutron damage near room temperature has been investigated for a wide variety of devices, and the data are presented in generalized form to increase their usefulness to device and circuit designers. Based on the experimental results, physical models are suggested for the reordering processes which occur during the annealing of neutron damage. Electron density is shown to be the most important factor governing the rate of transient annealing. Annealing factors are estimated for very early times (1 µs) following neutron exposure. Suggestions are made to minimize the effects of transient annealing on devices."

"Gain saturation for filamentary parts of a Gaussian laser beam were measured in a CO2laser amplifier using a pinhole technique. The results show that the detailed growth of a Gaussian beam in the amplifier as well as the overall growth can be described by the well-known homogeneous saturation function. The small-signal gain constant was found to have the same value of 2 dB/m for all radial positions on the beam. The saturation parameter, however, decreased from a maximum Value of 40 W/cm2on the beam axis to 18 W/cm2on the beam wings. The profile of the saturation parameter had an approximately Gaussian shape with a width of 3.9 mm, the same as the width of the laser beam. Diffusion is suggested as the reason for this radial variation of saturation characteristics."

It is shown that the reflected waveforms can be readily characterized by superpositions in time of direct, specular, and diffracted rays."
"A recent letter by Steber and Krueger reports that any system function of order n may be simulated using at most (n+4) operational amplifiers. The present letter shows that all such systems can in fact be realized using only (n+3) operational amplifiers. More significantly, this letter contradicts the validity of another result by Seely by pointing out that even if all the poles of T(s) are simple and distinct it may not always be possible to realize it using only (n+1) operational amplifiers."

Conversely, an ascending frequency signal is, upon reflection, compressed into one of shorter length. This letter extends the concept to the compression of pulses reflected from zone plate gratings, and contrasts this with the recently described use of zone plate envelopes for pulse compression. The possibility of compressing laser pulses into shorter, more powerful pulses is discussed."

"This paper, an introduction to this first Special Issue on Optical Communications, follows some of the arguments that have prevailed for and against optics as a viable communications medium for terrestrial and space applications, and assesses the present state of the art of optics devices, systems, and theory, based on discussions with scientists and engineers who have been specializing in the optical field. It also attempts in a small way to give some appreciation of the special problems the traditional communications engineer faces in readjusting his thinking and his \"physical intuition\" in going from the world of electrons to the world of photons."
"The development of coherent optical sources, producing usable amounts of power, has provided a stimulus for communications research. Coherent sources in the form of lasers and parametric oscillators are available at wavelengths which span the entire optical spectrum. This paper reviews the state of the art of coherent optical sources with major emphasis on the most highly developed sources."
"This paper reviews the field of high-speed small-aperture modulators for applications in optical communications, with emphasis on electrooptic modulation. The capabilities and limitations of electrooptic modulators are discussed based on a review of the physical origin of the electrooptic effect. Thermal and photoconduction phenomena, which may severely limit the operation of practical devices, are emphasized. The modulation power and bandwidth limitations using various schemes of electrooptic interaction are derived and compared. It is shown that lumped modulators are capable of efficient modulation for bandwidths up to about 1 GHz for visible wavelengths and are also attractive for their simplicity. For broader bandwidth capability the traveling wave or zigzag types of interaction become more efficient but with added complexity. Finally, acoustooptic and magnatooptic modulators are briefly discussed and compared with electrooptic modulators."
"Methods for direct modulation of semiconductor lasers are reviewed with the objective of indicating the advantages and limitations of each method. Techniques for producing amplitude, pulse, and frequency modulation of the optical wave are included. The modulation capabilities of present pulsed lasers are analyzed with special attention given to their operation at room temperature. In addition, several ways of producing analog position or width modulation of microwave-rate optical pulses are described, and the capabilities of optical frequency modulation by acoustic waves are reviewed. A new way of obtaining mode-locked optical pulses with a semiconductor laser is also suggested."
"The characteristics of high-sensitivity photodetectors suitable for wide bandwidth optical communication systems are summarized. Photodiodes, photomultipliers, and photoconductive detectors for wavelengths from 0.3 µm to 10.6 µm are covered. The use of internal current gain by means of avalanche and electron multiplication and by means of optical heterodyne detection to increase sensitivity of high speed photodetectors is discussed. The application to visible and infrared laser communication systems is reviewed."
"Experimentally measured characteristics of the sampling function in the dynamic cross-field photomultiplier are presented. A self-mode-locked He-Ne laser with a pulse-repetition rate nearly equal to the photomultiplier sampling rate is used to determine the sampling characteristics of this device. Experiments with a device with two regions in which different dc fields can be established are also reported. With this device, sampling intervals of less than 10 percent of the RF electric field period can be obtained with very little reduction in gain compared to conditions yielding-broader sampling intervals."
"Passive linear optical components play a primary role in an optical communications system for use in space applications. The important functions of acquisition, tracking, transmit-beam off-set, and background-noise discrimination may be efficiently implemented using passive optical elements. These specific system functions are discussed with reference to a representative system in order to identify the required features of particular optical components. This is followed by a detailed discussion of the optical components including: a 1/2-Å Fabry-Perot filter; a transfer-lens/optical-image-divider combination capable of 0.1-second of arc tracking accuracy; variable deviation wedges for transmit-beam offset; dichroic beamsplitters for isolation between the transmit and receive beams; and an axicon for redistributing the Gaussian energy profile from a TEM00-mode laser to match the obscured circular aperture of a conventional Cassegrainian telescope."
"Research on optical communication systems indicates the future need for a compact, rugged, and economical medium for circuit realization. Encapsulated planar arrays of rectangular dielectric waveguides are attractive for this purpose. The individual guides would have dimensions on the order of a few micrometers while the planar arrays might cover an area of a few square centimeters. Integrated circuit technology appears adaptable to batch processing such circuits. Recent theoretical and experimental results are surveyed which support this viewpoint."
"As optical communication systems are being studied in more detail, the need for many different types of optical waveguides becomes apparent. The applications range from miniature optical circuit connections to long-distance high-capacity transmission links. The requirements with respect to cost, attenuation, dispersion, or flexibility are vastly different. As different as the specifications are the guides evolving for various purposes. We describe the state of the art and give a survey of those guides which show the greatest future potential."
"The theory and observations of the optical propagation effects of the clear turbulent atmosphere are reviewed, with particular attention to those characteristics most important to the designer of an optical communication system. Among the phenomena considered are the variance, probability distribution, spatial covariance, aperture smoothing, and temporal power spectrum of intensity fluctuations, and similar quantities for phase fluctuations and angle of arrival."
"Measurements of the square of the structure constant of the atmospheric refractive index averaged over a 25-km propagation path are presented. The daily behavior of this parameter Cn2for 4 days in July, 1969, are shown. The measured values are in the range from 0.5 to 4×10-17cm-2/3."
"The scatter fields experimentally observable at the image plane of an optical receiver are modeled in a way that is consistent with the concepts and notations of both radiative transfer theory and the probability-computing receiver. Transient response and Doppler effect are considered. Single-particle scattering and its relationship to multiple scatter as treated by radiative transfer theory are reviewed. The statuses of experimental data and a variety of approximate methods for predicting the channel are also discussed."
"This paper describes a facility for measuring the spatial and temporal impulse response of a cloud to a pulse of light from a Q-switched ruby laser, and presents some experimental results. No single simple model adequately describes the transient response of real clouds in the variety of situations observed."
"As an experimental verification of a novel application of the laser-Raman radar, frequency-shifted Raman components of a Q-switched ruby-laser pulse from atmospheric molecular gases and from chemicals in an oil plume, such as CO2, CO, SO2, O2, and N2, were analyzed selectively. These results demonstrate the practical usefulness of this new optical system as a real-time air pollution probe."
"The origin and magnitude of the several kinds of background noise that perturb optical communication receivers are discussed, including background radiation sources viewed directly, radiation reflected from background objects, and radiation scattered by the atmosphere into the receiver field of view. An extensive bibliography on this topic is presented."
"This paper is concerned with the problem of finding the structure and performance of the receiver that yields the best performance in the reception of signals that are described quantum-mechanically. The principles of statistical detection and estimation theory are discussed, with the laws of quantum mechanics taken into account. Several specific communication systems of practical interest are studied as examples of applying these principles. Basic concepts in quantum mechanics that are needed in these discussions are briefly reviewed."
"A rigorous basis for the quantum analysis of the steady state of linear distributed systems is established. The analysis of a distributed system of finite length requires, for self-consistency, that excitations be stated at the boundaries of the system even in the absence of externally applied excitations. The commutators of the amplitudes at the boundaries are stated and a useful analogy with thermal noise of classical systems is established. The use of these boundary conditions enables one to formulate the theory of the steady state for distributed quantum systems. When the system under consideration is coupled to a dissipation mechanism, operator-noise sources have to be assigned to the dissipative elements. The commutation relations that must be obeyed by these noise sources are derived. This formalism enables one to analyze the steady-state operation of an attenuator and of a maser amplifier. Finally, properties of multiterminal-pair networks are discussed using the steady-state quantum approach."
"The current understanding of quantum detectors, the noise mechanisms which limit (are basic to) their operation, and their application to optical communications (theory) is summarized. In this context, we are considering channels in which the electromagnetic field is not subjected to any propagation effects other than a geometric loss. (Such a channel would exist between satellites.) Consequently, we will concentrate on optimum time processing using the tools of statistical communication theory. Fundamental to the study of a detection process is the need to develop a good mathematical model to describe it [1]-[6]. Therefore, approximately one-fifth of the paper is devoted to establishing, in a semi-classical analysis, the quantum detector output electron number as a conditional Poisson process with the conditioning variable being the modulus of the electromagnetic field. Once this has been established, these results are used to derive various limiting probability densities related to actual practice. Although the mathematical details are omitted, these results will be presented from the viewpoint of orthogonal function expansions and interpreted in terms of an eigenspace. The resulting current flow is analyzed next as a shot noise process, and the power density spectrum is calculated. Attention is focused on isolating the signal components from the noise in terms of both the current probability density and the power density spectrum. Examples are given where appropriate. At this point, an understanding of the underlying noise processes will have been presented and attention will shift to analog and digital communications. The analog communication will be presented primarily in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio. The S/N ratio in direct detection will be presented both as a ratio of the integrals of two separate portions of the spectrum and as a ratio of two moments of the probability density describing the current. These calculations will be extended to include heterodyne detection. Digital communications will be discussed in the context of detection theory. It will be shown that the likelihood ratio is often a monotonic function of the random variable representing the number of electrons flowing. Hence optimum processing will consist of a weighted count of electrons from various counting modes. Digital design will be presented in terms of M-ary signaling, error probabilities, and information rates."
"This paper is concerned with an examination of how statistical communication theory can be used to combat the effects of atmospheric turbulence in optical communication systems. The objective is to provide a framework to be used in discussing and relating the analytical results presently available in the literature as well as some new, or at least not widely known, results and in motivating and guiding future work. Both digital communication and parameter and waveform estimation are considered, with the greater emphasis on the former. As necessary mathematical preliminaries, the relevant statistical channel model, the problems of spatial representation, quantum field models, and the output statistics of optical detectors are considered. For digital-communication systems, the structure and performance of optimum quantum receivers and of structured receivers, e.g., direct-and heterodyne-detection receivers with either a single detector or a detector array, are discussed and related. The simplifying approximations and assumptions required to obtain these results are emphasized. Estimation theory is considered primarily from a classical (nonquantum) viewpoint. The quadratic functional structure of the processors that result from certain approximations to the likelihood functional are emphasized. Cramer-Rao bounds on the estimation performance are considered and applied to several examples."
"The theoretical possibilities of communicating through scattering channels are considered in the context of digital communication. Direct-detection, heterodyne, and optimum receivers are discussed and the near optimality of direct-detection systems is noted. It is found that the error probability depends only upon the total received signal energy if certain noise thresholds are exceeded; below these thresholds the performance deteriorates rapidly. It is often difficult to exceed the thresholds with present-day technology, but it should become possible to do so as the technology evolves."
"The purpose of this paper is to consider the theoretical error performance of several digital formats suitable for use with a mode-locked laser source, to discuss the problems of implementing these formats, and to consider the design of an illustrative system. Several techniques for time multiplexing are also described. It is assumed that the transmission medium introduces only additive noise and that the detection process is signal shot noise limited. Among the formats examined the practical choices which can achieve highest information rates with lowest probabilities of error are binary, differential phase shift keying, and binary pulse position modulation. For purposes of illustrating state-of-the-art performance the design of a 4000-mile repeatered binary pulse code modulation intensity modulated system is outlined."
"Frequency-division multiplexing techniques offer means for circumventing the bandwidth limitations of optical modulators and detector. Practical broad-band long-distance optical communication system of this type appear feasible and some possible embodiments are described. Calculations are made to determine the approximate information capacity and other characteristics of several 4000-mile repeaterad systems."
"The increasing sophistication of optical (and infrared) components and techniques, combined with rapidly expanding communication requirements, suggests that optical systems operating partly or entirely within the atmosphere may soon represent desirable solutions to real communications problems. The design of such systems will be strongly influenced by considerations of atmospheric turbulence, molecular absorption, and aerosol scattering. The most promising alternatives are heterodyne systems operating at the 10.6 µ wavelength, and direct-detection systems at near-infrared or visible wavelengths. Feasible links include horizontal, ground-to-satellite, and satellite-to-ground (or aircraft) geometries. System requirements and atmospheric effects are reviewed. Components, signaling, and diversity techniques which will partially overcome atmospheric limitations are discussed. Specific representative systems designs are presented."
"A design concept for an optical data relay link between two earth satellites is presented for missions requiring ultra-wide information bandwidths, 100 to 1000 MHz, and detected signal-to-noise ratios greater than 30 dB. Only analog modulation is considered owing to the inherent complexity in digitizing analog data of the bandwidths of interest. The optical system is compared to a microwave system on the basis of the primary power required at the transmitter, using system and component characteristics likely to be achieved with a moderate development effort. The conclusion is that an optical system will require an order-of-magnitude less power than the best microwave system."
"A description is presented of the system configuration, principal components, and preliminary system test results of a laboratory laser communication link for high-fidelity transmission of base-band analog signals with bandwidths up to 0.4 GHz. An experimental system is described in which the information signal first is frequency modulated onto a 1.5-GHz microwave subcarrier. This FM subcarrier is then intensity modulated onto the laser beam by means of a gigahertz-bandwidth electrooptic modulator. The FM/IM signal on the beam is demodulated in the optical receiver by means of a fast-response photodetector and a gigahertz-bandwidth frequency discriminator. Results of initial measurements of linearity and frequency-response characteristics of the signal-handling components of the system are given, as well as overall system characteristics. A single-frequency argon laser is used as the source of the optical carrier."
"Experiments in short-pulse optical communications have been performed at high data rates (107bit/s) with M-ary modulation formats and, using a subnanosecond internally gated receiver, at very high data rates (2 × 108bit/s) with binary modulation formats to experimentally verify the potential of short-pulse low-duty-cycle direct-detection formats. High resolution TV pictures and error rate data are given for two M-ary formats, pulse interval modulation and pulse position modulation, and error rate data and gated optical receiver characteristics are given for the 200-Mbit/s pulsed gated binary modulation. Results demonstrate the capability of short-pulse laser-communication systems to discriminate against background light and to efficiently convey information. Subnanosecond gating of the receiver was achieved in the 200-Mbit/s experiments. In the M-ary experiments, as many as 12 bit/pulses were transmitted, using 4095 digitally selected 1 -ns time slots. High-quality TV pictures were transmitted at average detected signal to background ratios of less than 0.01."
"A generalized statistical model is developed for the intermediate frequency (IF) signal of an optical heterodyne receiver. The model considers inherent frequency modulation of the carrier and local oscillator and also amplitude and phase fluctuations of the received carrier as it passes through a turbulent atmosphere. The power spectral density of the frequency modulation of the lasers is modeled and corroborated by measurements. Computations of the power spectral density of the atmospheric fluctuations are also presented. A nonlinear recursive estimation technique is developed for estimating the phase of the IF signal. Simulation results are presented for two statistical models of the atmospheric fluctuations."
"The development of a sensitive all solid-state receiver for 10.6-µm radiation is presented. The receiver consists of an RF-biased mercury doped germanium photoconductor and a solid-state microwave package which includes the detection system and the microwave-biasing source (a transferred electron oscillator). The responsivity of the photodetector was 9.6 × 103volt per watt at a modulating frequency of 1 kHz, and the photoconductive response time was 7 ns measured at an optical power of 1 µW. At a modulating frequency above 1.5 MHz, the detector system is amplifier noise limited with a noise figure of 8.5 dB. The noise equivalent power (NEP) (10.6 µ, 1.5 MHz, 1 Hz) and detectivity D*(10.6 µ, 1.5 MHz, 1 Hz) of the detector were 2.5 × 10-13W (Hz)-1/2and 4.15 × 1010cm (Hz)1/2/W at 4°K, respectively."
"A generalized computational technique is developed for the optimal design of optical communication systems from the standpoint of minimal cost and weight for a specified performance criteria. This technique is described for thermal- and shot-noise-limited direct-detection systems and for heterodyne-detection systems. A computer program for performing the optimization is also described."
"The ranging error of short pulse optical tracking systems is investigated. The relationships between the tracker characteristics, the characteristics of the received signal and background radiation, and the measurement accuracy are determined. It is found that the effects of characteristics of the tracker, the propagating medium, and/or the target to be tracked will predominate in the derived accuracy expressions. This result is based on the assumption that the transmitted pulse duration is short compared to the delay fluctuations induced by at least one of these three effects."
"Laser communication systems which have been built into serviceable units are reviewed. Although systems built prior to 1965 were more of a breadboard nature, some early experiments of historical interest are described. After 1965, techniques and component reliability were sufficiently improved to permit the development of several interesting and sophisticated systems. Performance characteristics of the more representative of these systems are listed. Recent trends show the use of infrared wavelengths, injection lasers, mode-locked/pulse-code modulation systems, optical heterodyne detection, and automatic pointing and tracking."
"An optical system is described which uses a photo electron counter system to detect and demodulate the optical signal. Measurements show the ability of the system to retrieve information from the signal at intensity levels giving only a few counts in each of a series of equal time intervals."
"Various measurements of the transient response of multiple scattered laser radiation as functions of a field of view in a controlled laboratory environment are presented. The data tend to agree qualitatively with previous theoretical calculations that showed the ill effect of multiple scattering from clouds in the path of laser beams to be small."
"Optical heterodyne mixing efficiency is shown to be invariant to detector position if the detector is thin and the frequency difference between signal and local oscillator is small."
"Consideration is given to multipath dispersion due to atmospheric inhomogeneities for point and nonzero-area apertures under clear weather conditions. Arguments are given which show that the time dispersion is primarily due to unscattered ray paths for large apertures. Using this fact an expression is derived for the structure function of the propagation time for large receiver apertures. This expression applies for large dispersions, i.e., beyond the uninteresting case where one has coherence over the receiver aperture. The expression indicates that during medium turbulence conditions, the dispersion for a 6-m aperture receiver system is 0.07 ps for a vertical path through the whole atmosphere and 0.695 ps for a 15-km horizontal path. In contrast, when using a point receiver aperture, the dispersion is expected to be considerably less than 0.001 ps for a vertical path through the whole atmosphere. Finally, a multipath equivalent circuit model is presented for the atmospheric channel."

The high-speed electrical modulation signal is obtained by a multiplexing of four separate information channels."
"Referring to the study of the generalization of the maximum power transfer theorem, it is shown that the proposed solution in a paper by Nambiar is not generally the only one.

The study is done in the case of nonreciprocity."

"This is a tutorial paper. It was written for technically knowledgeable people who are not specialists in automatic control. It might also be of some use in university courses in automatic control. Linear feedback of the state variables for stationary linear plants permits choice of the gains to place poles (eigenvalues) of the controlled system in desired locations. Continuous estimates of the state variables can often be made from one or more measurements of the output using a filter of the same (or lower) order as the plant called \"an observer\": the poles of the observer can be placed arbitrarily through choice of the observer gains. Combining an observer with state-variable feedback yields a \"compensator\" design; the poles of the controlled system are the poles of the observer plus the poles of plant with state-variable feedback, which greatly simplifies the design problem."
"A geometrical arrangement is described that allows matrix-addressed arrays of light valves to be built out of optically active materials which do not possess a switching threshold. Such arrays can be used for optical selectors, composers, and displays. Unlike classical coincident matrix addressing, this new scheme does not impose any limitation on addressing speed nor is it critically dependent on uniformity of switching properties within the material. The basic scheme consists of forming the rows of the matrix on one piece of material, the columns on another, and separating the two pieces with suitably oriented polarizers. This scheme can be applied to ferromagnetic, ferroelectric, and electrooptic solids and optically active liquids. A modified form of the separated matrix scheme, employing no polarizers, can be used with light scattering, absorbing, or reflecting materials which have no switching threshold."

A total of eight canonic realizations are given for synthesizing each of the four types of electronic relays. In conclusion the design of two complete practical electronic relays is presented and the actual performance is verified through experimental measurements."
 "Neuristor propagation analysis techniques apply to a wide variety of nonlinear distributed electronic devices and wave propagation phenomena. This paper brings together and reviews these techniques. A specific example, the superconductive tunnel junction stripline, is modeled by a distributed equivalent circuit described by nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations. The neuristor pulse propagates at constant velocity with a fixed waveshape; mathematically, this reduces the partial differential equations to ordinary differential equations which are solved by phase-plane topology analysis. Poincaré's index rule and Bendixson's negative criterion prescribe the pulse velocity and waveform. Analytical results agree with experiment. Pulse waveform stability is studied using eigenfunction expansion of the perturbation equations and Lyapunov theory, but complete results are not obtained. Lyapunov theory provides estimates of excitation thresholds for launching a neuristor pulse, which are consistent with experiment. Determining the nature of pulse interactions may for some systems be accomplished using the Bäcklund transformation or perturbation series techniques, but generally requires complete computer solution of the dynamical equations."

"The two major objectives of sensory aids for the blind are to permit access to printed matter and to permit safe travel through the environment. The difficulties of designing technological means to achieve these objectives are in many respects unrelated to the concerns of the engineering laboratory. Social, economic, political, and logistic considerations all play a role. The \"blind population\" in the United States includes both the totally blind and those with a wide range of visual impairment. This population totals about 400 000 people in which the aged, the multiply handicapped, and those with significant residual vision predominate. Singly handicapped, working-aged people are the initial targets of the current sensory aids. Expansion of their range of usefulness to larger fractions of the blind population is expected to come later. About 800 agencies serve the blind population in the United States, and in 1967 they were responsible for an annual expenditure of $500 million. In contrast the sensory-aids research and development budget was less than $1 million. Nevertheless, several potentially useful prototype devices have been developed and are about to be evaluated in this country; at least one is of foreign origin. But if these devices are ever to have the opportunity of reaching the blind public, then mechanisms for evaluation, field trials, manufacture, and deployment must be set up. The field of currently active sensory-aids research programs is reviewed. Several programs are concerned with increasing the convenience and accessibility of braille by the application of computer technology. Nevertheless, despite the unquestionable value of these developments, the usefulness of braille is limited by its bulk, its cost, and the transcription time. To provide direct access to printed documents several devices are being developed that transform optical images from a printed page into auditory or tactile displays requiring motivation and training for effective use. These machines are termed \"direct-translation\" units and are designed for simplicity and low cost. Other systems utilize print recognition techniques to create a reading machine providing braille or speech as an output. These machines offer potentially faster reading rates and their use promises to be easier to learn than direct-translation machines, but at the penalty of complexity and high cost. Several mobility aids designed to augment the cane or guide dog have recently been developed. These are also described. The prospects of achieving direct input to the visual cortex are discussed. It is apparent that the cost of this research is likely to be extremely high in relation to the size of the blind population which might ultimately benefit. Somewhat more easily realizable is a visual substitution system involving stimulation of an area of the skin. Several systems are being developed but all suffer from limitations in image resolution. Finally, an examination of the organization of research and funding reveals that the U.S. program is small, poorly coordinated, and contains some seemingly unnecessary duplication of effort. Several obvious lessons emerge which, if heeded, could greatly improve the effectiveness of sensory-aids research by providing development, manufacture, evaluation, and deployment services within an integrated program."
"An acoustooptic loss modulator made by bonding an X-cut quartz transducer to a fused silica scattering medium offers a practical means for repetitively Q-switching continuously pumped Nd : YAlG lasers at repetition rates up to 50 kHz. The peak power output of a multitransverse mode laser is typically enhanced by a factor of about 500 relative to CW operation at low (≪5 kHz) repetition rates and by larger factors when the transverse mode structure is suitably restricted. At high repetition rates, the peak power becomes smaller and the average power output approaches the CW level. The theoretical Q-switching behavior derived from the rate equations governing an ideal four-level laser is presented in graphical form, and is found to describe the observed behavior well when the laser is restricted to oscillation in the TEM00transverse mode. Similar calculations for Q-switched intracavity second harmonic generation indicate that the peak output power available at the second harmonic slightly exceeds that available at the fundamental, and that the harmonic coupling necessary to optimally couple the Q-switched laser is several orders of magnitude smaller than that required for CW intracavity conversion. Experiments using Ba2NaNb5O15For intracavity Q-switched harmonic generation roughly verified these predictions. A peak power output of 220 watts at 0.532 µ in the TEM00mode was achieved. Surface pitting of the nonlinear crystal after a few hours of operation prevented a thorough comparison with the calculated results. Preliminary experiments using the doubled Q-switched Nd : YAlG laser and an ammonia dihydrogen phosphate crystal to generate ultraviolet (the 0.266-µ harmonic) yielded a peak output power of 40 watts."
"It has often been suggested that operating logical circuitry at low temperatures would have many advantages. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such suggestions quantitatively. Changes in physical properties of materials upon cooling to low temperatures have been analyzed to determine their impact on the parameters which control the performance of logical circuitry. The following topics have been considered: electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, thermal energy, heat transfer, superconductivity, liquid helium, low-gap high-mobility semiconductors, and thermal activation of atomic motion."
"This paper considers a nonlinear time-invariant network N (of order n+h+l) which contains, in addition to the usual elements, h stray elements (stray capacitances and lead inductances) and l sluggish elements (chokes and coupling capacitors). It is proved that the asymptotic stability of any equilibrium point of N is guaranteed once the simplified (i.e., with stray and sluggish elements neglected) linearized network and two other linear networks SHand SLare asymptotically stable. The networks SHand SLare obtained by both a physically intuitive argument and by a rigorous one. It is also proved that if any one of the three linear networks is exponentially unstable, then the equilibrium point of N is unstable. This theory explains the commonly occurring fact that N is unstable even though the simplified linearized network is asymptotically stable. An example illustrates the several possibilities. The asymptotic behavior of the natural frequencies of N (valid in a neighborhood of the equilibrium point) is obtained in the proof. It is shown in Appendix II how the natural modes of the three simple networks are related to those of the given network N."
"Light diffraction by surface acoustic waves is used in studying the propagation characteristics of Rayleigh waves on y-cut z-oriented LiNbO3. In reflection, only the surface deformation contributes to the diffracted light. In transmission, the photoelastic effect, which is incident beam polarization dependent, must also be considered. Such optical probing has been used to study the Fresnel diffraction radiation pattern of an interdigital transducer, to measure beam steering effects related to transducer misalignment on an anisotropic substrate, and to measure reflection and transmission coefficients of an electrically loaded transducer. Attenuation measurements have been made over frequencies as high as 3.5 GHz. The power dependence of attenuation and harmonic generation is also examined."
"An electronic model of the retina has been developed with a new technique in making interconnections between the cells. The model consists of about 700 photoreceptors and the same number of output cells. The output cells have concentric on-center type receptive fields and show the Mach-band and the Broca-Sulzer effects."

"Lensless Fourier transformation (LFT) holograms of a (1 by 0.75 cm) rectangular aperture of a millimeter wave horn approximating a point source and of an extended object in the form of a back-illuminated opaque letter A have been formed using 70-GHz coherent millimeter wave radiation. A spiral scan format was utilized to record the net irradiance in the hologram plane with the aid of a millimeter wave crystal detector. Images retrieved from demagnified transparency film records of this irradiance distribution exhibit the general characteristics of LFT holograms and confirm the resolution capabilities of the holographic imaging process."
"An edge separation method of detecting one-dimensional objects in a given size range is described, and its capabilities contrasted with those of the conventional linear matched filter approach to object detection."
"Analytic closed-form switching time expressions of a tunnel diode are derived considering the voltage dependence of the diode junction capacitance and a small inductance that is always associated with the trigger circuit. The contribution due to the capacitance variation and that due to the inductance are expressed by a separate term added in the usual switching time results."
"Frequencies scaled from an Alouette II ionogram can be in error by five times the resolution of the sounder system when linear interpolation is used between the nominal values of the frequency markers. These errors are significant for certain geophysical measurements. A correction procedure is presented which allows frequency measurements to be made with an accuracy comparable to the resolution."
  "The receiver dynamic range centering studies of Ward and Rappaport have been extended to the situation where the radar signal amplitude statistics have the log-normal form. Results analogous to those previously published for the Rayleigh and modified Rayleigh cases are presented graphically, and show that receiver dynamic ranges considerably larger than those for the Rayleigh distribution may be required for given minimum probabilities of signal exclusion."
"A novel induction machine with continuous speed control is found possible. This motor may be regarded as an inverted version of a Schrage motor in construction in that the tertiary winding is placed along with the secondary (on the stator) rather than with the primary (on the rotor). Hence a static commutator connected to the tertiary winding with the brushes placed over it at the appropriate places helped in injecting an EMF (of slip frequency) at various angles with respect to the secondary EMF induced by brush rotation. This has resulted in speed control of the induction motor. The performance characteristics of the new motor resemble those of a series-regulated induction machine in contrast to the shunt characteristics of a Schrage motor."

"Reciprocity relationships for electromagnetic fields with general time dependence in bianisotropic media are derived and discussed. Constitutive relations of complementary media are defined to warrant a modified reciprocity relationship. As a consequence, the magnetoelectric media, the Tellegen media, and the moving media are all nonreciprocal. The complementary media to uniformly moving media with symmetrical permeability and permittivity tensors in their rest frames of reference are the same ones moving in the opposite direction."
"The characteristic equation of a MOSFET which up to the present has been expressed by two equations is given by a single equation using a hyperbolic function. The pulse response analysis of a complementary MOSFET inverter is carried out with the use of this new characteristic equation, and the results that have been shown by several equations are represented by a single equation."

"An analysis is presented for the nonlinear behavior of power amplifiers utilizing negative-resistance diodes in a reflection circuit. The analysis applies to both stable and locked-oscillator modes of operation. Special emphasis is given to a simple model involving a cubic nonlinearity in theI-Vrelationship, and to the idealized LSA device in an amplification mode."
"This paper utilizes a simplified physical model to describe TRAPATT (TRApped Plasma Avalanche Triggered Transit) operation. By yielding on computational accuracy, a complete high-efficiency device design is generated and the dependence of operation on physical parameters is elucidated. The extreme complexity of the precise differential equations describing TRAPATT operation has made the calculation of a single diode-circuit configuration a tour de force. However, by observing the important features of such a solution, a simplified approach giving realistic answers has been evolved. A theoretical device design has been evolved. This design provides device width and impurity density as a function of TRAPATT frequency, and indicates a decreasing degree of \"reach through\" with increasing frequency. In addition, the explicit dependence of width and impurity density on the diode's reverse saturation current has been obtained. The launching of the avalanche zone through the diode, and, in particular, the limitations implicit in the recovery to a swept-out state, are of broad significance in other types of diodes, particularly p-i-n switches and \"snap\" diodes."
"Evaluation of fabrication procedures and operating life have indicated that moisture can play a major role in determining the performance of nematic liquid crystal displays based on the dynamic scattering mode (DSM) in anisylidene-p-aminophenyl-acetate. There is strong evidence that the presence of moisture promotes electron injection by lowering the potential barrier between the metal electrode and the liquid crystal. This could arise from a lowering of the effective work function of the metal by adsorption and/or increasing the electron affinity of the liquid crystal by molecular attachment. In any case the injected electron is captured by a neutral molecule and transported as a negative ion. The electron is removed by an oxidation process at the anode leaving the original molecular species free to repeat the process. It was also found that a short pulse (shorter than a space charge build-up time) could be used to electrically quench dynamic scattering and appreciably reduce the relaxation time. The use of this new scheme significantly improves the brightness and contrast of matrix addressed, real time displays based on dynamic scattering. A novel \"laminate\" structure for realizing such displays is also presented."
"A pulsed (∼3-5 µs pulse width; 30-200 Hz repetition rate) resistance bridge that graphically displays the resistance voltage characteristics of semiconductor samples is described. Using this instrument it is possible to detect changes in the resistance\\Delta Rof the semiconductor sample of approximately 0.1 percent. With this sensitivity one can determine the quality of the contacts that are applied to the semiconductor. We illustrate the operation of the pulsed bridge, including a comparison between \"good\" (ohmic) and \"poor\" (nonohmic) contacts, by using indium antimonide at 77°K as the semiconductor."
"A dispersion relation for waves in an extrinsic semiconductor plate or film with an applied electric field is derived. It is shown that there exists an infinite number of modes. An arbitrary perturbation can be expressed as a superposition of modes. Expressions for the expansion coefficients are derived. Finally, it is shown that a perturbation which is initially a plane wave in a thick plate, remains an approximate plane wave in a time interval corresponding to the decay time, except near the boundaries. Thus, an apparent discrepancy between the theories of infinite- and finite-dimension semiconductors is resolved."
"Transport equations are derived for particles, momentum, and energy of electrons in a semiconductor with two distinct valleys in the conduction band, such as GaAs. Care is taken to state and discuss the assumptions which are made in the derivation. The collision processes are expressed in terms of relaxation times. The accuracy is improved by considering these to depend on the average kinetic energy rather than the electron temperature. Other transport equations used in the literature are discussed, and shown to be incomplete and inaccurate in many cases. In particular, the usual assumption that the mobility and diffusion constant depend locally on the electric field strength is shown to be incorrect. Rather, these quantities should be taken as functions of the local average velocity of electrons in the lower valley."
"The realization of the predicted dc to RF conversion efficiency of LSA oscillators operating around 100 GHz is expected to require low-loss resonant circuits. At these higher frequencies, the practical difficulties attendant upon the construction of conventional waveguide elements suggest that a more compact resonant circuit may be useful. The resonator studied theoretically in the present paper takes advantage of the self-resonance of a cylindrical LSA diode loaded externally by a concentric dielectric ring. By this means, a design consistent with heat dissipation requirements for CW operation is reached for frequencies in excess of 70 GHz."
"The present work gives detailed analysis of the transit time of injected minority carriers in the base region of drift transistors, taking into consideration the effect of recombination as well as the variations in the built-in electric field. Some useful impurity-density distributions in the base region are analyzed in detail. Graphs of transit time for these distributions under different conditions are given. The work also includes the distribution that yields minimum transit time for a specified field parameter."
"The design procedures for a NOR logic element using a nonlinear collector resistor are described. The nonlinear collector resistor is used as a means for reducing dissipation over a linear resistor with the same fan-out capability. The nonlinear resistor is combined with a standard transistor-resistor logic gate to reduce the effects of two of the undesirable characteristics of this type of logic, namely, high dissipation and slow transient response. In the analysis an expression for fan-out is developed to determine base network resistances. Typical design examples are described with calculations made for MOS-type current limiters. Circuits were constructed and tested to verify these calculations."
"Using the Lagrangian formulation, the large-signal electronic admittance for a long transit angle cavity is calculated. The double integral equation of time and space must be solved; the integration is carried out first in the space direction to obtain accurate space-charge expressions. These solutions are valid even if electron overtaking occurs."
"It is demonstrated that two stable high-field domains can be launched in a single multiterminal Gunn device. Such \"two-domain\" operation may be used for frequency division."
"Control of nucleation of high-field domains in GaAs has been reported for essentially one-dimensional samples. The present work reports an optically triggered bimodal form of domain launch in a 3- dimensional sample. The preliminary experiments describing this effect are given, indicating an optically induced time shift in domain launch without a corresponding change in the repetition rate of a domain-generated pulse train. A useful application of this effect to a circulating digital optical memory is described."
"Impedance measurement of light-illuminated MIS diodes was made. It becomes clear from the results that in the inversion region conductance of the MIS structure is more sensitive to illumination than its capacitance and that negative photoconductivity appears at low frequency, which is explained by the theory of Grosvalet et al."
"Construction details of a mica millimeter-wave pressure window are given. Insertion loss under 0.4 dB from 60 to 90 GHz was achieved."

"A study of the nucleation and propagation of single and multiple domains in n-GaAs has led to the development of a circuit oriented lumped model for the representation of this phenomenon. The lumped bulk model accurately predicts device behavior during domain nucleation, modulation and quenching, without indicating domain position within the bulk. The proposed equivalent circuit is developed in a logical fashion and its implications are pursued in some detail. Device studies with the lumped model have produced results exhibiting exceptional agreement with BULK-D, a digital computer program which determines the electric field and carrier distributions in bulk GaAs from current continuity considerations and Poisson's equation."
"A lumped model capable of representing domain nucleation, modulation, and quenching in n-GaAs has previously been reported. In the present paper an algorithm is proposed which successfully describes the process of domain dissolution. An analytical description of the mechanisms involved is achieved by characterizing the shape of a stable domain and by postulating the existence of an \"apparent\" domain which maintains the stable-domain shape while passing across an ideal anode boundary. The actual domain is then treated as that portion of the apparent domain remaining within the device. It is shown that during the dissolution process the apparent domain undergoes a growth mechanism due to the rise in device current. A complete mathematical description of the phenomena is subsequently incorporated into the original lumped model and simulated with the digital program BULKSIM. Device studies with the extended model have produced results exhibiting exceptional agreement with a distributed model simulated by the program BULK-D."
"A relatively complex nonlinear model is derived for large-signal analysis of high-power high-frequency junction transistors. The model, based on a modified Ebers-Moll equivalent circuit, is particularly useful when the transistor operates as a high-speed switch and is generally either ON or OFF, and seldom in between, or ACTIVE. A digital computer program NET-1 is used for transient analysis of the model."
"A two-dimensional numerical analysis has been amde for junction field-effect transistors with small and large values of length-to-width ratio. Comparison of the results for different drain bias voltages shows the cause of the saturation of the drain current and the finite differential drain conductance in the saturation region. The effects of the geometry of the device and the field dependent mobility to the drain characteristics are clarified. Detailed pictures of the free carrier density distribution are presented, and the minimum channel width and the channel length are given for various bias conditions. A conduction path from the source to the drain with appreciable free carrier density has been found for bias conditions normally considered as pinched-off conditions. The drain characteristic with gate bias voltage is seen to be equivalent to that of a device with correspondingly smaller width and zero gate bias."
"Low-frequency noise measurements are made on specially fabricated silicon tetrode planar transistors. The measurements show the existence of three distinct sources of excess noise: a 1/fnoise source associated with the surface; a l/fnoise source associated with the active base region; and an anomalous burst noise source associated with the forward-biased emitter-base junction. Burst noise which is present in many transistors is a random fluctuation of the dc currents of the transistor. The terminal characteristics of these various noise sources are described and a modified noise model is presented which is useful for low-frequency noise calculations."
"It has been proposed that degradation of low current hFE, as a result of avalanching the emitter-base junction of a bipolar transistor, can be attributed to an increase in surface recombination velocity within the emitter-base space-charge region. This work shows that 1/fnoise is also increased during avalanche and that this increase is consistent with a previously reported correlation between surface recombination velocity and 1/fnoise."
"A particular thin-film structure is analyzed to determine the conditions for thermal filament formation. Assuming that these conditions are satisfied and that the structure is electrically biased so that a thermal filament exists, the current-voltage characteristic and small-signal equivalent circuit for a general conductivity-temperature characteristic in the thin film are determined. It is shown that an abrupt or discontinuous change in conductivity with temperature of the type observed in materials exhibiting semiconductor-metal transitions is not necessary to obtain thermal filaments. It is also shown that if there is no thermal hysteresis in the conductivity -temperature characteristic of the thin film, the filament equivalent circuit for the particular structure analyzed is closely approximated by a resistance in parallel with an inductance. The thin-film prop. erties required for this inductance to be independent of both the ambient temperature and the bias current are defined. If thermal hysteresis exists, the analysis shows that small-signal distortions occur, the inductance will become frequency dependent at low frequencies, and a nonlinear resistance must be added to the equivalent circuit in series with the inductance. Measurements on this structure using VO2as the thin-film material are presented and discussed, and are shown to verify the conclusions based on the analysis."
"Plates of lead zirconate-lead titanate ferroelectric ceramic can have 1) low-loss optical transmission in thin, polished sections and 2) uniaxial birefringence dependent upon remanent polarization. These properties are potentially useful in electrically variable optical retarders, modulators, and latching light gates. This paper reports the results of measurements of basic light-gate devices using ferroelectric ceramic plates. A number of characteristics of the devices are reported; e.g., dependence of absolute light phase retardation on ceramic remanent polarization; dependence of ON-OFF ratio on exit aperture, switching pulse duration, and light wavelength; switching speed; and the dc hysteresis characteristic of the dependence of remanent polarization upon applied field. In the past, the use of ferroelectric devices under conditions producing partial switching has been discussed exclusively from the point of view of \"charge-limited switching.\" This paper proposes a new mode of operating ferroelectric ceramic light gates using \"voltage-controlled switching.\" Charge-limited switching results naturally when voltage pulses of short duration are used (appreciable ON-OFF ratios can be obtained from a light gate switched with pulses as short as 10 ns). As a result of the hysteresis in the dc switching characteristic, pulses with durations of the order of milliseconds or longer result in operation of the light gate in a voltage-controlled mode. Practical advantages resulting from this mode of operation are discussed."
"The time required for tunneling through a wide potential barrier has been obtained, in general, using a closed form method. We show that a knowledge of the phase delays at the boundary surfaces yields the tunneling time and as a consequence the tunneling time is independent of the barrier thickness. For the particular case of a rectangular barrier the tunneling time is identical with that derived by Hartman [1] and by Franz [2]."
"Equivalent generators are developed to represent a conducting cavity of arbitrary size and shape through which a periodically bunched beam of charged particles passes. This development is reminiscent of the Lorentz reciprocity theorem. Three circuits are developed: a Norton's theorem generator, a Thevenin's theorem generator, and an equivalent wave generator."
"Probability density functions and the corresponding cumulative distribution functions for density and Velocity fluctuations at the surface of a thermionic emitter are discussed. In particular, it is shown that as far as velocity fluctuations are concerned, the appropriate probability density function is given byf(w | r_{c}) = (2 / \\pi^{3/2}) \\exp (-w^{2}), where w is the reduced velocity. Some of the misunderstandings encountered in the technical literature are also discussed. It is shown that the mean energy of the emitted electrons is 3/2kT and not 2kT, as is claimed sometimes, the quantity 2kTJs, where Js, is the saturation current, representing the magnitude of energy flow."
"A new method of measuring noise parameters of electron beams is proposed which requires only two fixed cavities, The demonstration was done with a gun in which the configuration of electrodes was different from normal."
"Ion-focusing of electron beams in high-power linear-beam microwave tubes is considered, and a qualitative discussion of the defocusing mechanism of an externally applied RF power is presented. The primary mechanism of beam breakup is the space-charge force of bunched electrons which limits the use of ion-focusing in high-power tubes."
"In a recording Storage tube, the relation between the rate of growth of the central maximum of the ion spot and the gas content is shown to be strongly non-linear. However, by integrating over the entire ion spot, it is possible to calculate the positive ion current and, from that, the gas ratio and gas content. It is concluded that, whenever possible, gas content should be determined by gas ratio measurements rather than by ion spot growth. The effects of an excessive gas content are discussed briefly."
"Differential capacitance was used to determine resistivity changes in high-BVCEOn-p-n epitaxial transistor structures caused by gold diffusion and subsequent heat cycles. Resistivities corresponding to 8 × 1014to 2 × 1015phosphorus atoms/ cm3were found to be compensated to 1012/ cm8after a 15-min gold diffusion at 1150°C, with the degree of compensation diminishing after heat cycling at lower temperatures. Capacitance readings after gold diffusion were determined at forward bias to measure increments of depletion width. Gold concentrations were determined by radiochemical analysis and were correlated with diode lifetime measurements. A minimum lifetime value of 2 ns after gold diffusion could be increased to 14 ns by a low-temperature phosphorus emitter diffusion."
"The small-signal model for the Gunn effect proposed by Englemann and Quate is revised to include the effects of average mobility of the two-valley system in the expressions for carrier velocity as a function of electric field. The dispersion relation is then rederived, and computed results consistent with experimental observations are shown."

 "A detailed treatment of the space-charge waves or carrier waves which are associated with drifting carriers in a semiconductor is given. These waves have a phase velocity comparable to that of the drifting carriers, but normally have very high loss. This dielectric relaxation loss may be radically decreased by utilizing the interaction between two sets of carriers, working with semiconductors of small cross section, or semiconductors placed against high permittivity materials. Gain may be obtained by using special materials such as GaAs, or by the use of interactions between two sets of carriers in the presence of a magnetic field. The treatment given neglects the effect of diffusion so as to keep the mathematics simple and emphasize the physics of the problem. In a later paper, methods of taking diffusion into account will be given."
"An RF power-density function is used to obtain some of the characteristics of small-signal traveling-wave amplification in solids. Criteria for determining instability conditions are developed, in terms of well-defined drift and phase velocities, for both electrostatic and electromagnetic wave systems. The results are useful, typically, at or below the microwave range. More exactly, we investigate cases where the operating frequency is much less than the carrier-lattice collision frequency and the wavelength λ is much greater than l, the mean-free path. Effects due to a transverse or longitudinal applied magnetic field and the presence of more than one carrier type are included; this leads to modification of the vdrift> vphaseamplification rule used in simpler systems. Diffusion effects are discussed. Helicon, acoustic-wave, and two-stream problems are used to illustrate some of the results. In considering the carrier-to-wave energy transfer, kinetic power is shown to be negligible in solids when kl > 1, where k =2π/λ. The important term is seen to be one neglected in earlier work. It represents power loss when no drift field is applied and negative loss under amplification conditions."
"A semiconductor plasma slab will support three classes of slow quasi-static waves: 1) bulk waves which involve space-charge disturbance throughout the bulk of a thick slab, 2) surface waves which involve surface charge disturbance along one surface of a thick slab, and 3) thin-layer waves which involve dipolar surface charge disturbance on either side of a thin plasma slab. A review of the linear stability theory for these waves indicates that each wave class can support one or more potentially unstable two-stream modes. Four of these modes should be observable in InSb: 1) a thin-layer wave interaction in the low magnetic field limit (\\omega_{ce}\\tau_{e} \\ll 1), 2) a collision-induced mode supported by the thin-layer waves when\\omega_{ce}\\tau_{e} \\gsim 1, 3) a corresponding collision-induced mode supported by the bulk space-charge waves when\\omega_{ce}\\tau_{e} \\gsim 1, and 4) a mode which results from the interaction of surface waves. The second mode has been well documented experimentally."
"The existence of several types of high-frequency majority carrier current instabilities in [100] and [110] oriented samples of n-type germanium has led to a renewed interest in the conductivity of germanium in a strong electric field. We review the experimental situation with regard to these instabilities and show how their properties can be understood in terms of bulk negative differential conductivity, which has been shown to occur in this material for temperatures below about 120°K. The present state of understanding of the origin of this BNDC effect in terms of the band structure and scattering mechanisms in germanium is summarized."
"Acoustoelectric amplification in composite semiconducting and piezoelectric structures is discussed, with emphasis on work with guided plate modes in PZT and LiNbO3. These guided modes have proven to yield very strong amplification at frequencies between 1 and 10 MHz, with a variety of mode-dependent characteristics such as frequency dependence and dispersion. A simple theoretical treatment for the acoustoelectric interaction in composite structures is given, which stresses the analogy with a piezoelectric semiconductor. The behavior expected from an interaction with several types of carriers is considered, and it is shown that the shape of the amplification curve, in this case, depends on an average drift parameter. Some experimental results involving both electrons and holes are also cited."
"The interaction between slow electromagnetic waves and drifting carriers in a semiconductor is analyzed including mechanisms important and peculiar to the semiconductor device. The growth rate coefficients, excitation amplitudes, and phase are found using a modification of Pierce's one-dimensional model of the traveling-wave tube. A technique for calculating a growing mode criterion is presented."
"The possibility of spin-wave/carrier-wave interactions has been considered with a more rigorous stability analysis than that used in previous studies. It is concluded that unstable bulk interactions in magnetic semiconductors will not be possible until resistivities are reduced to several orders of magnitude below those presently available. Composite YIG-InSb structures are potentially unstable at room temperature. The composite system can provide high-gain, slow-wave amplification at X-band with delay line capability (2300 dB/cm at 7.5 GHz). In a uniform magnetic field, the instability exhibits an exceedingly narrow bandwidth, 2.5 MHz, which would be a great disadvantage in any practical application as an amplifier. This could be offset somewhat, with a resulting loss of gain, by applying an inhomogeneous magnetic field."
"A review of recent advances in the understanding of the interaction of light and ultrasonic waves in solids and liquids is presented, emphasizing the Bragg diffraction regime wherein the diffracted optical energy is confined near one angular direction. The usefulness of optical beam probing techniques, using laser light sources, for investigating such subjects as ultrasonic attenuation and diffraction, acoustic nonlinear phenomena, magnetoelastic interactions, and photoelastic properties of materials is described. The application of the acoustooptic interaction for the design of devices intended to perform optical information processing functions is also mentioned. Present applications include optical modulators, switches, sequential scanners (such as are useful for television display), random access optical deflectors, and optical correlators. An attempt is made to describe the assets and liabilities of acoustooptic devices and to speculate concerning their future in the practical world."
"Paramagnetic impurities which interact primarily with the resonant phonons in a dielectric crystal and show large magneto-optical properties can be used as a tunable and sensitive probe of the acoustic waves, or phonons, in a dielectric crystal. Such a technique usually works only at a few degrees Kelvin and is tunable over a wide frequency range, 10-500 GHz, with a magnetic field."
"Described are the resonance effects associated with surface plasmon excitation (the excitation of evanescent electro-magnetic surface waves) which occur when light is reflected from metal gratings and rough surfaces."
"The parametric excitations of electron-hole density fluctuations by means of a long wavelength radiation field is discussed. The kinetic equations for electrons and holes driven by a \"strong\" homogeneous radiation field is solved. The condition for the onset of instability is obtained."
"A hydrodynamical model of plasma turbulence is developed. A cascade concept is utilized to solve the problem of closure, which is characteristic of any nonlinear system. The spectra of kinetic and electrostatic energies are investigated for both the collisional and collisionless cases. In the former case, the spectrum of potential energy from the electrostatic potential fluctuations, as a function of the wave numberk, and denoted byG(k), follows the lawsG \\sim k^{-3/2}andk^{-9/2}in the inertial and dissipative subranges, respectively. In the latter case, the dissipative lawG \\sim k^{-5}is derived. The solutions of the kinetic energy spectrum are also found. The anomalous diffusion, called the Bohm diffusion, is derived in the present theory, and is found to play the role of a sink of energy flux across a potential spectrum."
"Quasi-particle descriptions of thermal or weakly turbulent fluctuations in classical many particle systems may be derived with the aid of a complete set of eigenmodes. For a Maxwell-Vlasov electron plasma, the latter comprise a set of continuous and discrete modes, the continuum modes being dressed single-particle excitations with real eignvalues. Fluctuation field correlations can be represented in terms of either the continuous eigenmodes or discrete quasi-modes; the latter characterize collective waves corresponding to complex quasi-eigenvalues (Landau poles)on the unphysical sheet of the complex frequency Plane. Quasi-mode representations of the dynamics of weakly correlated fluctuations can be interpreted in terms of quasi-particles moving in their phase space along trajectories determined by dispersion relations characteristic of quasi-mode \"energy.\" The quasi-particle density in phase space is determined by the amplitude correlation spectrum of the quasimodes."

 "In the approximations usually employed, the behavior of a GaAs sample in high fields is determined by Poisson's equation and current continuity plus appropriate boundary conditions. It has been demonstrated recently that boundary conditions can determine such properties as the threshold for Gunn oscillations and their amplitude [1]. In this paper we go through all the stationary solutions that can be obtained for different values of carrier concentration and field at the cathode. The method employed is that of the \"field of directions,\" used extensively by Boer and associates [2], mainly for CdS. By means of this analysis, it is possible to understand many diverse phenomena found experimentally or predicted by computer solutions, e.g., 1) the finding of Shaw, Solomon, and Grubin [3] that, for a cathode field in the negative differential conductivity (NDC) range, the Gunn threshold occurs at a current densityj \\cong nev_{d}(E_{c}), wherenis carrier concentration andv_{d}(E_{c})the drift velocity at the cathode field; 2) the switching, decrease of current with increasing voltage, and hysteresis found by Kroemer [1] for a sample with a shallow Schottky barrier; 3) the switching that occurs in some samples, after the initiation of Gunn oscillations, to a low-resistance state with an avalanche region at the anode."
"A rapid technique for estimating the carrier mobility, average and minimum carrier concentration, and contact resistance in operational Gunn diodes is presented. Although the physical nature of the functional Gunn-effect device (i.e., an n-type active layer with only two n+ohmic contacts) restricts what can be measured, it will be shown that information useful for estimating device performance can be obtained if some simplifying assumptions are granted. The procedure is illustrated by data obtained from five separate wafers of vapor-phase, epitaxially grown gallium arsenide."
"A one-dimensional computer simulation of Gunn diodes with zero-impedance external load has been made for various nonuniform doping profiles including asymmetrical step-like ones, linearly graded ones, and a periodic square-wave one. The distances between the electrodes and the doping level are taken as 10 µ and an order of 1015cm-3, respectively. Current-voltage characteristics, oscillation current waveforms, oscillation frequency versus applied voltage characteristics, and electric field distributions as well as their dynamic changes were computed for the profiles with various parameters. The results show that with asymmetrical doping profiles, Gunn oscillation takes place when the cathode is on the higher resistance side, while for the opposite polarity it is difficult for the oscillation to occur. In the latter case, a static high-field domain is built up in the vicinity of the anode. The results also show that the voltage dependence of oscillation frequency is enhanced by an asymmetrical nonuniformity in the doping profiles. A considerable rise of the threshold voltage of the oscillations is found for the periodic square-wave profile. An experimental result is analyzed on the basis of the computed results."
"The theory of nonlinear fundamental and subharmonic resonances in the avalanche region of IMPATT diodes is developed by use of the method of harmonic balance. Due to the high resonance strength of the subharmonic mode, and as a consequence of large-signal parametric interaction, the negative resistance of the diode is markedly increased at the presence of a self-pumped oscillation of twice the frequency of the fundamental mode, especially for low-transit angles across the drift region."
"Small-signal measurements of germanium IMPATT diode admittance in the frequency range from 2 to 8 GHz were taken for various current densities. These measurements were compared with the small-signal admittances calculated using the model developed by Gummel, Scharfetter, and Blue [1], [2]. Values for the ionization coefficients and saturated velocities for electrons and holes used for the calculations have been chosen to secure reasonable agreement between theory and experiment for the diode avalanche voltage, the frequencies at which the small-signal susceptance and conductance cross zero, and the slope and general shape of the admittance versus frequency curves. The calculated small-signal admittance characteristics of the n+-p-p+mesa diode investigated are quite sensitive to the saturated hole velocity and the field dependence of the ionization rates. For the operating junction temperature, the velocity which gives the best fit is resolvable to about 5 percent. The best fit velocity is in agreement with published values. However, the ionization coefficients determined give a substantially smaller dependence of ionization rate on electric field than was obtained by Miller [3]. The coefficients obtained can be fitted by Baraff's theoretical model [4] using a low value for r, the normalized ionization cross section, in order to obtain the small dependence on field. The values of the ionization rates determined here,\\alpha_{p}=2.15 \\times 10_{5} \\exp(-7.10 \\times 10_{5}V.cm-1/E) cm-1\\alpha_{n}=4.90 \\times 10_{5} \\exp(-7.90 \\times 10_{5}V.cm-1/E) cm-1are believed to be generally applicable to impact ionization effects in germanium semiconductor devices."
"Negative resistance characteristics have been observed in the range 3-12 GHz in silicon pvn diodes using avalanche transit-time operation (IMPATT diodes). The diodes, made by a single boron diffusion into epitaxial wafers, had breakdown voltages from 40 to 100 volts. A few hundred diodes all showed, quite reproducibly, microwave negative resistance. Measurement by swept-frequency reflection showed that the negative resistance was present over wide frequency ranges. Oscillation was observed when the diode was put in the coaxial and waveguide \"cavities.\" The oscillation could be tuned over a wide frequency range. The maximum output observed is 30 mW at 11 GHz with 1.7 percent efficiency. Cooling experiments indicated that substantially larger output is possible by proper engineering of the heat disposal. The spectrum width of oscillation, when the diode is reasonably well tuned, ranged from 100 to slightly below 5 kHz. The load impedance into which the diode can oscillate changes from capacitive to inductive, going through a maximum as the oscillation frequency increases. The diodes were found to have so-called microplasmas."
"A preliminary feasibility study has been made of vacuum-deposited thin-film diodes based on the p-Se/n-CdSe heterojunction system. These diodes have excellent rectification properties, including: 1) 70-volt reverse breakdown, 2) 105rectification ratio over a range of 25 volts, and 3) 0.5-volt forward offset voltage. The diodes have a \"sandwich-cell\" structure formed by depositing a CdSe layer onto a Crystallized layer of Se. This work is still in a preliminary stage. However, the results thus far suggest that these diodes may be suitable for use in thin-film integrated circuits for those specialized circuit applications which require only diodes, resistors, and/or capacitors."
"The performance of bulk InSb mixers is investigated, A heterodyne experiment has been performed at 69 GHz with IF's varying from 0.4 to 20 MHz. In this experiment the conversion loss was measured as a function of the intermediate frequency (IF) for ambient temperatures in the range 1.5 to 20°K. The IF at which the conversion loss increased by 3 dB determined the response time. Using an electron temperature model, expressions for the conversion loss and the response time are derived by making a small-signal expansion of an energy balance equation. Good agreement between theory and experiment is shown. In this theory the InSb mixer is viewed as a bolometer mixer. An evaluation of mixer performance, stressing operation at ambient temperatures in the 1.5 to 20°K range, is presented. The available tradeoffs between conversion loss and response time as a function of ambient temperature and applied fields are given. Values as low as 11 dB for the minimum conversion loss can be obtained at 1.5°K, where the maximum useable IF is 1 MHz. To obtain a substantially higher IF, such as 10 MHz, the temperature must be increased to 16°K. However, the optimum conversion loss increases at a rate of 1 dB/°K and is 27 dB at 16°K. It is also shown that the device performance of InSb mixers can be predicted satisfactorily from static I-V characteristics and that the best mixer material can be determined by making simple dc measurements."
"A rapid type of second breakdown observed in silicon n+-p-n-n+transistors is shown to be due to avalanche injection at the collector n-n+junction. Localized thermal effects, which are usually associated With second breakdown, are shown to play a minor role in the initiation of the transition to the low voltage state. A useful tool in the analysis of avalanche injection is the n+-n-n+diode, which exhibits negative resistance at a critical voltage and current. A close correspondence between the behavior of the diode and the transistor (open base) is established both theoretically and experimentally. Qualitative agreement with the proposed model is obtained for both directions of base current flow. It is shown that transistors having thin, lightly doped collector regions are particularly susceptible to avalanche injection, which suggests that some compromise may be necessary in the design of high-frequency power transistors."
"In this work a theoretical model is derived for predicting the response of a photoconductor. This model takes into account direct recombination, surface recombination, recombination through traps (for the two limiting cases of high- and low-trap effect), Auger-type processes, and diffusion effect. Complete solutions are obtained for both steady-state and transient conditions for these various cases."
"A semiconductor photodetector is proposed which makes use of an internal reflection method to enhance the photoresponse. This method is to let the incident light be multiply-reflected in the detector so that a long distance is traveled and most of the photon energy is absorbed by the detector. Theoretical analysis of the steady-state and time-dependent photoresponses for a p-i-n photodetector is presented. The photodetector is found to be particularly useful in detection of light with wavelengths near the intrinsic absorption edge. The photodetectors are fabricated from 4000 Ω.cm n-type, oriented silicon wafers. Both sides of the wafer are polished with one side inclined one-half degree with respect to the other. The p+n junction and the ohmic contact are formed by alloy method. The measured photoresponses for wavelengths of 1.0 and 1.1 µm are in reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions."
"Photomultipliers and avalanche photodiodes are compared as detectors of short light pulses such as might be encountered in laser ranging or laser PCM communication systems. Expressions are derived for the optimum spectral response of the amplifier-filter combination which maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio for the two detectors. Assuming that this optimized filter is used, the minimum detectable energy of a laser pulse is then calculated for the two detectors as a function of detector quantum efficiency, laser pulse length, and background light level. As an example, the detectors are compared for laser pulses of lengths 100 ns, 10 ns, and 1 ns at 1.06 µm."
"An analysis of the double-coupled helix with a gyromagnetic material (ferrite) inside the inner helix is presented using the field theory approach. Quantitative results are presented for the slow-wave solution. Qualitative results in the form of graphs illustrate wave propagation characteristics, impedance, resonance effects, and electric field variations for typical values of the ferrite parameters. The nonreciprocal nature of the ferrite material is demonstrated. Also, some important aspects of ferrite are pointed out which give support to the view that this type of material may improve traveling-wave tube operation."
"This paper describes the investigation of harmonic generation in traveling-wave tubes (TWT's) via large-signal analysis and digital computer techniques. Efficiency degradation and harmonic power content are shown to be importantly related to such TWT design considerations as circuit dispersion, harmonic coupling impedance ratio, and gain level. Also described is the phenomenon of second harmonic interference in the beam bunching process and how it leads to substantial efficiency reduction in TWT's employing relatively nondispersive structures."
"A digital computer program for the simulation of crossed-field electron guns is described. The program simulates the electrodes and fields within the gun on a matrix of up to 10 000 points. The program, written in FORTRAN II for the IBM 7090, is generally executed in six minutes or less. It is shown to produce results within four percent of theory and experiment for two different cases."
"Radioactive tracer gases are used to study the RF-activated gas cleanup process in duplexer discharges. The radioactive mapping technique provides means of calculating the effective discharge area and expected operating life of quartz tubes used in pre-TR and ATR devices. In metallic-wall TR tubes, the tracer technique is also useful for the study of dominant sorption mechanisms and the critical area of discharge."
"An association between magnetron anode vane erosion and presence of oxides in the cathode has been noticed at several laboratories in the past 10 to 15 years, although it does not seem to have been formally reported. it has been suggested that CO rather than oxygen is involved, but the prolem has not been clearly resolved. It assumes some importance in connection with the use of oxygen replenishers in cold cathode cross-fields amplifiers using aluminium cathodes."
 "A klystron frequency multiplier for 0.4-mm waves is described, generating its own driving power by means of an oscillating extended interaction buncher. By making use of the 18th to 22nd harmonics and two catcher cavity modes, the tube is tunable over a 15 percent band. The maximum output power is 1 mW CW at 673 GHz."
"The coupled-mode equations or a thin beam in a crossed-field electron ube are given for the general case of a noncentered beam."
"A slow-wave structure intended for use in solid-state traveling-wave amplifiers is described. The structure is a meander line with adjacent conducting elements electrically connected by lumped capacitors. The dispersion curve is derived and shown to agree with experiment. The structure is found to have a passband which is dependent on the coupling capacitors. The interaction impedance is estimated."
"In a recent paper, Gray has shown that the open-circuit photovoltage ratio of p+n to n+p junctions is given by the mobility ratio. We show here that this is an overestimation, the ratio being much smaller if an exact analysis is used."
"The forward V-I characteristics of p-n-p-n power switches usually consist of one or more voltage shifts having negative resistance characteristics at small forward current. This phenomenon is attributed to local turning on of the switch due to shorted emitter and/or shorting dots used to enhance the dv/dt capability of the device, since lateral current flow plays a significant role in determining the V-I characteristics at small current, It is shown that the threshold current responsible for the voltage shift phenomenon has an empirical temperature dependence of the formI_{T} \\sim \\exp [- a(T - T_{0})]over the temperature range 20-125°C. The hysteresis loop associated with each negative resistance region can be explained in terms of the difference in turn-on current and holding current of a localized area in the vicinity of shorted emitter or shorting dots."
"Recently several analytical formulas for the velocity of high-field domains in materials with bulk negative differential conductivity and field-dependent carrier diffusion have been published. The formulas were derived under the conventional \"invariant domain\" condition, and they thus represent solutions of the fundamental equations which are not necessarily stable. Numerical calculations of mathematically stable domains, allowing independence of one space dimension and time, have been made and are reported here. The results are consistent with the analytical formulas."
"The effect of minority carrier traps on certain transistor characteristics is calculated. It is shown that trapping of electrons by donors in the base region of Si transistors can lead to the degradation with increasing temperature in β and fTof the type observed by Schlig on n-p-n Si transistors."

"The characteristics of a coaxial avalanche diode oscillator circuit are calculated and compared with experimental results. The circuit admittance, as seen at the diode terminals, is calculated in the frequency domain for \"optimally tuned\" experimental conditions. The impulse response function of the circuit, as obtained from the transformed admittance, is used to obtain time-evolution solutions of the avalanche diode circuit system. The impulse response is more general than the previously employed differential equation characterization of a lumped element equivalent circuit. The simulation presented of the high-efficiency mode of oscillation allowed no adjustable parameters and is in excellent agreement with experiment. The simulation verifies the original TRAPATT [1] explanation for the high-efficiency mode of oscillation."
"Diode edge effects can be a source of error in doping profile measurements made by the capacity versus voltage technique or CIP technique. A numerical calculation indicates that for uniform doping the apparent doping will be higher than the actual doping by a factor of(1 +bx/r)^{3}whereb=1.5andx/ris the ratio of depthxto diode radiusr. Comparison with other sources of error shows that edge-effect error will be the largest error when the diode diameter is greater than 10 mils (250 µm) because this error decreases at the slowest rate as the diameter increases (as the reciprocal of the diameter rather than the reciprocal of the diameter squared)."
"The drift velocity of electrons in high-resistivity silicon was measured by studying the current pulses induced in a surface barrier diode by subnanosecond light pulses from a super-radiant gas laser. Measurements were made for electric field strengths up to ≃1.2 × 104V/cm, at room temperature. The low-field mobility value obtained was 1400 ±5O cm2/V.s. The decrease of mobility for higher fields is in substantial agreement with previous results though the nonlinearity at high field is somewhat smaller than that found in other time of flight measurements. Analytical expressions that approximate the experimental trend of mobility versus field are briefly discussed."
"Assuming a state-of-the-art microwave planar geometry, the maximum frequency of oscillation has been calculated for GaAs-Ge heterojunction transistors utilizing either doped or high-resistivity space-charge-limited emitters. This is compared with a Ge homojunction transistor of the same geometry. A detailed equivalent circuit is used which accounts for the parasitics of the chip. It is shown that if chip parasitics are neglected, GaA-Ge devices should outperform Ge devices by about 4 to 1 in power gain. In the geometry assumed, however both heterojunction and homojunction transistors are limited by wafer parasitics, particularly base contact resistance. The calculated figures of merit of the two types of devices are therefore quite similar."
"The values 1-1/Mfor both electrons and holes, whereMis the multiplication factor, have been calculated in three different silicon p-n junctions. The logarithmic plot of 1 - 1/Mversus the normalized voltageV/V_{B}is well approximated by a straight line for 0.1 > 1 -1/M> 0.005. This range corresponds to the useful range of α0for most bipolar transistors. An empirical expression has been obtained for the ratioV_{CEO}/V_{CBO}within this range."
"A display device, e.g., projection TV, can be made by scanning, with an electron beam, a large sheet of electrooptic crystal in a light valve configuration. The design equations indicate the following. 1) The transfer function will be reasonably linear. 2) The resolution measured at the crystal will be the order of two TV lines per crystal thickness at 15 percent sine; wave response. 3) The output light spectrum can be nearly white. 4) Writing rates of the order of 10 MHz are feasible with conventional high-resolution CRT electron guns. 5) Large screen image brightnesses of the order of 40 to 50 fL are obtainable with xenon arc lamps and f/l collimator lenses. 6) Image contrast will generally be limited by the polarizer-analyzer quality. The electrooptic crystals must be several hundred millimeters in diameter and several tenths of a millimeter thick. Obtaining such crystals is the most serious obstacle to device construction."
"The classical quasi-static model of space-charge limiting estimates time averages of the potential distribution and the current flow. But numerical studies by Birdsall and Bridges have indicated important limitations in the classical model. In particular, it makes no estimate of the fluctuation in the electric field. This paper proposes an alternative model that does estimate the fluctuation. The model leads to a pair of coupled second-order equations that closely resemble the classical equations. First-order solutions are obtained by an iterative process. The location of the points of zero field are only in fair agreement with the values obtained by discrete-charge methods, but the predicted fluauation in the peak electric field is considerably better. In particular, the model predicts a much larger fluctuation at the anode than at the cathode (for currents near the threshed of instability) in agreement with Birdsall and Bridges' numerical results."
"This correspondence presents a proof that when Schottky barrier approximations are applicable to a p-n junction, a straight line on the graph of log C versus\\log(V+V_{B})requires a power law dependence of doping on depletion width. This dependence isx^{(1/n-2)}."

 "Four original papers are assembled in this issue to highlight the work which is being carried out on the use of electron beams in microelectronics. A brief background description is given of the phenomena which are of interest for microelectronics. This is followed by short descriptions of the scanning electron microscope and an electron projection system. Various features of the original papers are tied in with the background material."
"A combination of electron beam and ion beam techniques were used in conjunction with conventional planar technology to fabricate a junction field-effect microwave switch. A digital tape-controlled scanning electron beam was used to expose mask patterns in polymethyl methacrylate resist whose line widths (≤1 um) are inaccessible to conventional photolithography; ion beam sputtering was used to remove a thin gold undercoat from within the exposed patterns, thereby maintaining the good edge resolution; and ion implantation was used to dope the closely spaced interdigitated source and drain regions thus exposed by the preceding process steps in the gold contact mask."
"When making a pattern for a solid-state device from a silicon wafer coated with photoresist by the scanning electron beam exposure technique, the positioning accuracy of the pattern is as important as its resolution and dimensional accuracy. A pattern positioning system automated by an electronic computer which is included in the electron beam exposure apparatus type JEBX-2B, is introduced and described. Information conveyed by backscattered electrons from the wafer surface is utilized as a signal which detects the wafer locus and automatically corrects any x-, y-directional and rotational errors. It is shown that the positioning accuracy is within 0.5 µm. It can be improved under some limited conditions."
"Gaussian-doped semiconductor junctions have a built-in electrostatic field E which usually varies linearly with distance from the surface. A series of solutions of the one-dimensional continuity equation for linear E field are given in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function and its limiting forms. These solutions are directly applicable to the collection of hole-electron pairs generated between the surface and the junction, and can be extended readily to cover generation at greater depths. The effects of bulk recombination and spatial variation of diffusion constant on the theoretical collection efficiency are also calculated. Using a generation function appropriate to a kilovolt electron beam, the minority carrier density versus distance and the collection efficiency of the junction are evaluated for zero and infinite surface recombination velocity."
"ELIPS is based on the use of an electron image tube principle to project large area (5-cm diameter) ultrahigh resolution (1 micron) electron images from a patterned photocathode onto an electron-sensitive resist layer, thereby replacing the conventional photoresist optical procedures in integrated circuit fabrication [1]. Integrated circuits of minimum linewidths of 0.5 mil have been fabricated to show the practicality of the technique through the full set of mask exposures necessary for a DZTL quad dual input NAND gate. The necessary alignments between successive masks were achieved by an optical dead reckoning technique which allowed the electron image to be adjusted in position and orientation from a known \"zero\" position to the separately determined location of the pre-existing pattern on the sample. Accuracy of such alignments was ± 2 micron. The much more desirable alignment technique, in which simple devices in the form of alignment marks on the target wafer detect separate electron beams emanating from the cathode, allows rapid alignment to submicron registration and the potential for the complete automation of alignment and exposure. The system provides for the rapid registration and exposure of wafers at high resolution over large areas with great depth of focus under vacuum clean, contactless conditions using an electroresist insensitive to ambient light. It makes practical the fabrication of very high-density planar devices allowing extremely complex large area circuits to be formed. Patterned photocathodes were fabricated by conventional photoresist techniques for the DZTL circuit discussed. For high-resolution (1 micron) patterns, cathodes can be defined in the electron micro-plotter (computer-controlled scanning electron microscope)."
"A method is described whereby the anode sputtering rate during recovery of a mercury arc valve can be estimated from its transient inverse current and voltage waveforms. Inverse currents have been measured in an experimental valve, from which corresponding anode sputtering rates are deduced for a variety of cathode coolant temperatures and commutation conditions. These measurements substantiate proposed methods of reducing anode sputtering in valves. The accuracy of the method has been confirmed by examining sputtered deposits found in an experimental valve after several hundred hours of rectifier operation. Major applications of this method are in the development and testing of valves for high-voltage direct current (hvdc) transmission. These include rapid assessment of the effect of design modifications on anode sputtering, and increasing the anode sputtering rate by a known factor through manipulation of the test conditions (e.g., cathode coolant temperature and dI/dt), thereby considerably shortening the time required for sputtering life tests. The latter application is particularly valuable in the case of single-gap valves where the effects of anode sputtering during recovery are likely to be the ultimate limitation on serviceable life. The saving in testing time is especially important because of the high operating cost of test plant at relevant levels, in our case 50 kV, 1000-ampere dc bridge rating."
"Changes in Gunn diode performance caused by 1.25 MeV Co-60 gamma radiation have been studied. Hall effect measurements as a function of temperature made on GaAs crystals grown by liquid epitaxy reveal an energy level 0.13 eV below the conduction band which was not detectable before irradiation. Detailed measurements of low-field resistance were carried out on Gunn diodes together with output power and FM noise in a fixed X-band cavity as a function of gamma ray fluence. The power output was degraded by 3 dB after a fluence of about 3×1017photons/cm2and oscillations ceased at fluences two to three times this value. The FM noise increased only slightly and can be related to the change in matching of the diodes to the cavity. These effects are explained in terms of carrier removal, in that irradiation generates deep levels which trap conduction electrons and reduce the carrier concentration. A theoretically derived power degradation curve for Gunn diodes is given and compared with the experimental results."
"This correspondence describes a technique for improving the accuracy of numerical calculations near a space-charge-limited cathode. A one-dimensional diode is employed to show that an order of magnitude reduction in the errors is obtainable when compared with those obtained using standard relaxation techniques."
"It is shown that the drift velocity saturation of the current carriers in the channel of a MOSFET iS an important factor in the analysis of the electrical behavior of such devices. The theory presented here, which includes this effect, shows improved agreement with measured output characteristics."
"Mesa avalanche diodes shaped in ring structures have lower thermal spreading resistances than conventional disk mesa diodes of equal junction area. A simple analog electrolytic tank was built to measure the spreading resistance of ring geometries, A normalized curve was obtained which allows the determination of thermal spreading resistance for any ring structure."
"Correction terms obtained from measurements on typical planar resistors are given and compared to values expected from two different mechanisms: inhomogeneous current flow around the contact or contact resistance between metal and diffusion layer. Good agreement between contact resistance model and experiment is shown."
"A new air-isolation process is described which overcomes many of the problems of existing isolation technologies. The process consists of standard integrated circuit processing except for the p-n junction isolation process which is omitted. After metal mask, the device wafer is glass bonded face down to a supporting silicon wafer. Subsequent backlapping, masking, and mesa etching steps yield an air-isolated integrated circuit. As one application of this technology, the fabrication of a radiation-hardened operational amplifier is described."

"Use of a microchannel-water electron multiplier makes possible a new, compact photomultiplier with time-resolution capabilities better than can be obtained from classical photomultipliers using cascaded dynode structures. The small thickness of the wafer, together with proximity focusing in the electron optics of the input and output of the wafer, results in reduction of the electron transit-time to about 1 ns. The electron transit-time spread is about 10-10seconds. Short pulses from a mode-locked laser were used to measure the impulse response of the photomultiplier. The experimental value of <500 ps (full width at half maximum) is in good agreement with the predictions of a computer analysis. Other salient characteristics of the new tube are: S 20 photocathode diameter of 11 mm; electron gain of about 105; dark current <10-16amperes (referred to the cathode); and 50-ohm output impedance."
"Theoretical models for the generation-recombination noise and trapping noise in metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier diodes are developed. Low-frequency excess noise in Schottky barrier diodes is found to be dominated by the modulation of the barrier height φB caused by fluctuation in the charge state of traps or generation-recombination centers. This noise mechanism does not occur in p-n junctions. The bias and the temperature dependence of the generation-recombination noise is critically compared with the experimental data for forward diode current ranges from 3 to 300 µA and operating temperatures from -25° to 100°C. Trapping noise in Schottky barrier diodes is observed at low temperatures in diodes not intentionally doped with deep level impurities. The experimental results on trapping noise can be described by assuming that the trap states have a constant capture cross section and are uniformly distributed in space, as well as in energy. The surface potential at the diode periphery also has an important effect on the Schottky barrier diode noise. The best low-frequency noise behavior is found when the surface is at the flat-band condition. An accumulated surface is always associated with a large amount of low-frequency excess noise."
"Performance of position-sensitive Schottky barrier gold-silicon photodiodes in the presence of uniform radiant background levels is investigated. Proper conditions of reverse bias and external circuit loading are shown to reduce the background saturation effects while maintaining nearly constant responsivity. The response of the lateral photovoltaic photodetector to CW-modulated and short pulse-width light signals is described. The effect of signal time dependence on the lateral falloff parameter is considered."
"The efficiency η and output power P per unit area were computed for silicon p-n-n+avalanche diodes having an active region of 5 microns. The condition for making both η andPmaximum is that the field at the n-n+interface generated by impurity and bias voltage is about one fourth of that at the junction under oscillation conditions. The maximum η andPwere calculated to be about 20.5 per cent and 53 kW/cm2. Dc current density J0for maximumPwas about 4200 A/cm2. On the other hand, J0for maximum η was calculated to be about 800 A/cm2. It was found that a diode having an abrupt type junction is the best. The condition under which a diode is represented by use of a diode with abrupt type junction is that the region of a homogeneous field near the junction is less than one fifth of the space-charge region."
"The differential equations describing an avalanching p+nn+junction in the presence of multiple-level carrier traps have been solved numerically for trap densities as high as two orders of magnitude greater than the n-region background doping. The results compare quantitatively with a number of past, as well as new, experimentally observed changes in avalanche microwave diode performance with neutron damage. In particular, trapped charge in the space-charge region tends to localize the avalanche region near the p+n junction, which raises the frequencies of operation. Carrier trapping at the edges of the space-charge region explains the increase in operating voltage and decrease in small-signal capacitance. The localization of the avalanche region, through carrier trapping in the space-charge region, and recombination effects at high avalanche current densities combine to cause eventual RF failure of IMPATT and TRAPATT diodes with neutron damage."
"Experiments have been carried out to measure the phase angle between a locked negative-resistance (Gunn) oscillator and its locking oscillator. Phase angle has been measured as a function of ambient temperature, oscillator bias voltage, locking power, and the voltage applied to a varactor tuning diode coupled into the locked oscillator. Results indicate that given a knowledge of the oscillator characteristics and the operating conditions, it is possible to predict, with reasonable accuracy, the phase of the locked oscillator. The relative merits of various methods of phase control are discussed and it is concluded that the best method is to use a varactor diode coupled into the negative-resistance oscillator."
"A new solid-state adaptive (analog memory) device is described and demonstrated. The device is a flat-band electronic transformer with adaptable voltage gain; that is, the voltage gain-frequency transfer characteristic can be \"set\" to different values of attenuation by the application of an adapt signal and will retain that setting after the adapt signal has been removed. Ferroelectric materials are used as the dielectric in the transformer structure composed of two capacitors bonded together so that mechanical vibrations established in one (the input capacitor) are coupled to the other (the output capacitor). Converse and direct piezoelectric effects generate the mechanical vibrations and the output voltages, respectively. Ferroelectric effects in either capacitor provide the analog memory capabilities. Experimental adaptive transformers demonstrated are suitable for audio frequency operation. The voltage and current gain-frequency transfer characteristics are flat over the entire audio frequency range. Maximum gain is typically about -20 dB. Application of a voltage pulse (100 to 300 volts) of low energy (mJ) to either side of the transformer can adapt the gains to specific lower settings (between-20 and -60 dB) within an arbitrary switching time (roughly 10+3to 10-4seconds) as determined by the pulse amplitude. Gain settings are electrically stable to within a few percent of the maximum gain for periods of at least one year, and possibly indefinitely, and can be reproduced by the same or an equivalent sequence of adapting pulses."
"In the parallel arrangement of two slabs of semiconductors incorporating drifting carriers, dispersion equations governing surface-wave propagation are derived. The wave is a space-charge wave along the interface. It can be the polarization wave utilizing minority carriers. The relation is deduced from a set of transport equations and boundary conditions. The dielectric relaxation frequency, which represents the attenuation coefficient in the usual theory, becomes negative and promotes the growing of the interface wave when the relative drift velocities of carriers in two semiconductors are in a special condition. It is a result of interaction due to field penetration between parallel semiconductors of nonequal material properties which are mutually translating. The Debye length and the \"unsymmetrical material property\" effect are Considered as the important factor. The dispersion equations are compared with the one-dimensional analysis to show a difference in the physical interpretation."
"A relativistically correct large-signal theory is developed for the analysis of high-power, axially symmetric traveling-wave amplifiers in order to investigate the physical phenomena involved in the interaction process. The nonlinear integro-differential system equations are developed from the Lorentz force equation, the one-dimensional equivalent circuit equation, the wave equation, and the continuity of charge relation. These equations are applied to two electron stream models: a ring model which permits the effects of nonlaminar flow and space-charge forces to be evaluated, and a disk-electron model in which these effects are ignored. The ring model space-charge fields are obtained from the appropriate Green's function for Poisson's equation in a moving frame of reference. Numerical solutions are presented and discussed with major emphasis on the disk-model solutions. The principal results are that the gain per unit length decreases with increasing beam velocity, the circuit phase velocity for optimum power output approaches the dc beam velocity u0, asu_{0}/capproaches unity, and the conversion efficiency is almost independent of u0for the synchronous case. The linearized one-dimensional theory of the traveling-wave tube is also discussed. Several of the large-signal results are predicted from the small-signal theory."

"A complete solution is presented for the small-signal high-frequency response of an idealized model of the insulated-gate field-effect transistor. Theyparameters are found by solving Bessel's equation and are plotted as functions of signal frequency and the quiescent conditions. In addition to these general results, simple approximate results that apply only beyond the point of pinch-off are derived for operation at moderately low frequencies."
"Current-voltage characteristics of the junction-gate field-effect transistor are analyzed based on a depletion layer model of the channel which is divided into subregions of constant mobility and of field-dependent mobility to reproduce the actual situation under various voltage conditions in order to clarify the effect of field-dependent mobility on the characteristics of the device. New formulas for design parameters are given and experimentally verified on specially designed and fabricated samples as well as on commercial samples. Agreement between theory and measurement is good."
"Recent predictions that thermal effects will limit future transistor speed improvement motivated an interest in predicting and measuring these effects. A mathematical model of the three-dimensional transient heat flow problem is presented which takes into account the physical structure of the device and the actual region of power dissipation. At any point within the device, the model predicts the time-dependent temperature response to a change in power dissipation. A new method of measuring the local time-dependent thermal behavior of small bipolar transistors is described and used to verify the model. It was found that the thermal spreading resistance becomes important in silicon transistors when the emitter stripe dimensions approach 1 µ. Furthermore, the thermal response is much slower than the electrical response. Also, it was confirmed that adjacent devices in integrated circuits are essentially thermally isolated as far as thermal spreading resistance is concerned."
"This paper describes a technique of obtaining numerical solutions of the basic carrier transport equations for a semiconductor and the results of some calculations pertaining to a silicon n-p-n transistor. The calculations include dc characteristics in direct and inverse operation, saturation parameters, and small-signal ac common emitterh-parameters. Both Boltzmann and Fermi statistics have been used, and the dependence of carrier mobilities on electric field has been taken into account."
"Vanadium dioxide undergoes a crystallographic phase transformation at 68°C which is accompanied by a large and abrupt change in resistivity. Two devices, a two-terminal threshold switch and a four-terminal thermal relay, based on this effect are investigated theoretically and experimentally with regard to switching applications. The formation of thermal filaments is found to have a strong influence on both the dc characteristics and on the switching properties. One consequence for both devices is that the power required to sustain the \"on\" condition is significantly less than that required for switching. It is shown that both devices should be capable of submicrosecond switching times at milliwatt power levels."
"Pulse-operated light sources containing cesium, rubidium, potassium, sodium, and a sodium-rubidium mixture were evaluated for spectral output as optical pumps for Nd:YAG lasers. The results are compared with those obtained from conventional xenon and krypton flashlamps, The sodium-rubidium mixture has a maximum spectral-output efficiency over the four pumping regions of Nd:YAG that is twice as large as that of xenon, when operated under similar conditions of keep-alive field and pulse power. Sodium and potassium are highly competitive with both xenon and krypton. Cesium and rubidium appear attractive at low pressures (≅20 torr) and low pulse-power inputs (≅2 kW)."
"This paper summarizes investigations of the velocity-field characteristic of both bulk and epitaxial GaAs as determined from measurements of the average conductivity of bar samples in a large microwave field. The characteristic for both epitaxial and bulk material with resistivity about 1 Ω.cm is similar to that reported by Ruch and Kino, and to that calculated from solutions of the Boltzmann equation. The bulk material, however, shows a decrease of negative differential mobility with increasing resistivity. The non-linear partial differential equation in one dimension and time governing the field in the samples has been solved numerically and the evolution of the field rearrangement under these experimental conditions has been modelled to show the validity of this technique."
"The simplified theories of crossed-field interaction only apply to limited zones of the interaction space of practical, high-efficiency CFA's. More complete theories need long computer programs to implement them. The aim of this paper is to describe a \"pencil and paper\" method of computing the characteristics of an operational CFA. At the beginning of the interaction space the gain process is described very accurately by the so-called \"small-signal\" theories. At the other end of the delay line the energy exchange process and the absorption of the electrons bythe line can be described by a \"large-signal\" analysis. After calculation of the limits of the small-signal zone and application of Feinstein and Kino's theory, the author synthesizes these two aspects of the same phenomenon into a practical method of computation of nonreentrant CFA's, and compares the calculations with experiments. As the physical meaning is not lost during this process, a valuable understanding of CFA operation can be gathered by the application of the method. A numerical analysis of the result of the large-signal theory finally shows that in order to obtain the maximum overall efficiency the electronic efficiency has to be matched to the circuit efficiency."
"Transistor structures were fabricated in si-doped solution, grown GaAs. The p-n junction used as anl emitter was formed during the growth of the epitaxial layer employing amphoteric Si doping. The collector junction was made by a planar sulphur diffusion. The behavior of the emitted light and the collector current as a function of the emitter base current are observed. The degradation in quantum efficiency and transistor alpha is noted to be due to the same diode current component. The degradation of alpha due to emitter crowding at high current levels is directly exhibited."
"A simple, inexpensive, essentially noiseless current-measuring device has been devised with a sensitivity of 10-16to 10-15ampere. Its operation relies on a measurement of the voltage decay of the device under test, the current being proportional to the rate of change of the voltage. Individual diodes of silicon vidicon targets (10-15ampere) and high resistivity layers (1015ohms/square) have been measured. In addition to its simplicity, this technique lends itself to nondestructive in-line testing."
"The area of integrated circuits can be reduced by not allowing any space between the contact and the junction edge. Epitaxially grown silicon contacts have been used to achieve this goal."
"A magnetoplasma such as that formed in n-type indium antimonide can efficiently transduce energy from one waveguide mode to another.

The maximum conversion efficiency is calculated to be 95 percent under conditions of the present experiment."
  "An experimental and theoretical examination indicates how the non-linear phase distortion of a traveling-wave tube is affected by relevant factors, especially the circuit loss.

 "The influence of carrier lifetime on the characteristics of high-power devices has been examined from the standpoint of forward voltage drop at a given current, using existing theories of the p+ln+diode and allowing for carrier-carrier scattering effects. It is found that in the absence of recombination current in the heavily doped end regions, there exists an optimum base lifetime giving a minimum forward voltage. This minimum occurs because for increasing lifetime, the increase in junction voltage due to carrier buildup at the junction edge eventually overtakes the reduction in base voltage due to conductivity modulation. On the other hand, when the recombination currents in the end regions predominate over that in the base, their presence tends to inhibit carrier buildup, with the result that for sufficiently large values of base lifetime, the forward voltage falls to a limiting value. In certain cases, this value is less than the minimum voltage found in the absence of recombination in the end regions. In all the cases examined, the conclusion is that little is to be gained by further increase in lifetime beyond a certain value which depends on both the properties of the base and those of the end regions."
"When a p-n junction is switched from the forward to the reverse direction by a current ramp, the reverse recovery time trris found 1) either to be equal to the base lifetime τ if the ramp rateR \\ll I_{F} / \\tau, 2) to be equal to 0.79τ ifR \\approx I_{F} / \\tau, or 3) to be equal to 0.7 τ ifR \\gg I_{F} / \\tau. These results afford correlations between τrrand τ and also provide the basis for a useful method for measuring τ."
"A set of curves is presented. These curves can be easily used to obtain the tradeoff relations between the reverse and the forward voltages of high-voltage p-i-n rectifiers. By using the lifetime as a parameter, those curves can also be used to achieve compromises between the forward voltage and the recovery time."
"This paper discusses methods for discriminating among various possible current-gain falloff mechanisms at high current densities. It is shown that although various mechanisms can predominate, well designed silicon transistors are usually limited by emitter efficiency. This is demonstrated experimentally for a variety of structures and values are given for the emitter saturation current density. Design rules for tradeoffs among current gain, basewidth, and emitter stripewidth are adumbrated."
"This paper describes the structure and electrical characteristics of a silicon p-n-p-n inverter switch which has been fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining both high-voltage and high-temperature capability in the same device while still maintaining reasonable dynamic properties. It was realized that in most inverter systems, feedback rectifiers are required, and thus the reverse blocking capability of a thyristor is not utilized. This was used to advantage in the design of a thyristor by integrating an anti-parallel rectifier into a conventional thyristor structure. Although this approach results in a thyristor having a negligible reverse blocking capability in comparison to commercially available power thyrisitors, the potential advantages of lower conduction losses, high maximum junction temperatures, and integrated antiparallel rectifier may be attractive for use in inverters. Reverse conducting thyristors designed in this fashion have been operated with reasonable turnoff times at a forward blocking voltage of 1000 volts while at case temperatures of up to 230°C."
"The modeling, measurement, and magnitude of the plasma-spreading velocity in a modern thyristor structure is discussed. A simple model based on lateral fields present in the p-base of the thyristor is derived. This model is compared with a diffusion model by examining the validity of their predictions. Data on the effects of variations in radial position, current density, temperature, base widths, cathode-emitter short density, and gold recombination site density are presented. Basically, the data show that the spreading velocity is l) independent of radial position 2) a linear function of the log of the current density, 3)increased with increasing temperature, 4) increased with decreasing p-base width, 5) decreased cathode emitter short density, and 6) decreased recombination site density. The derived model is shown to provide a reasonable explanation for these effects which is qualitative and in some cases quantitative."
"The plasma spread properties of various thyristors were studied utilizing an infrared viewing technique. The plasma velocity occurring prior to equilibrium, and plasma spread conditions at equilibrium were determined. Velocity versus current density diagrams were generated for low-frequency, high-voltage and high-frequency, low-voltage devices. Effect of the initial turned-on line on plasma spreading is discussed."
"In the all-diffused thyristor, the shunt pattern can easily be introduced by photo masking or silk screen techniques. It is known that the emitter shunts of various designs affected the rate of rise of forward blocking voltage, the forward I-V characteristics, the loop effect, the turn-on time, the dynamic forward voltage drop, and the reverse recovery time. This paper will show their relations to several shunt patterns based on experimental results."
"This paper describes how the current pulse ratings of thyristors during turn-on spreading can be obtained from the maximum allowable junction temperature based on time-to-failure using a combination of analytical and experimental methods. The instantaneous junction temperature rise of a thyristor is analyzed with the aid of a digital computer. In the calculation of temperature rise, the transient thermal impedance during turn-on spreading is considered. Analyzed results agree with the values obtained directly by an infrared detector. In order to estimate the maximum allowable junction temperature based on time-to-failure, \"step-stress capability tests\" were conducted. In many cases, it was found that there were modes of both catastrophic and degradation failure. The maximum allowable junction temperature was estimated for the nonrepetitive and repetitive current pulse ratings."
"This paper describes design, development, characterization, and operation of a two-terminal, high-current, high-voltage silicon four-layer diode. The main feature of this new four-layer diode is a voltage-current characteristic which is, prior to switching, similar to that of an avalanche diode. This property is achieved by short-circuiting one emitter-base junction, resulting in a grid-type emitter geometry. The short-circuiting takes place over the entire device area in order to maintain uniform turn-on and uniform current conduction. Devices switching at 1000 volts or higher, with peak pulse current capability of 1000 amperes or more, are described. To achieve very high switching voltages, the stacking of two or three silicon chips was found to be useful. Extended tests Were performed at various combinations of pulsewidths (0.5 to 12 µs), repetition rates (0.2 to 2000 pulses per second), and operating times (0.1 to 2500 hours). The test circuits and the resulting turn-on and recovery times are summarized, Failure analysis establishes hot spot development or thermal fatigue as possible failure mechanisms. Since series operation of many devices is possible without complicated dividing networks, the complexity of pulse modulator circuitry is reduced, and resonantly charged circuits can exhibit a high degree of operation reliability and temperature insensitivity."
"The ratings of GCS's have remained around 10 amperes and 600 volts since the early 1960's. The problem of increasing the device's capability is therefore reviewed. Experimental results show that turn-off is governed by the diversion of the anode current through the gate,the sequence of junction recovery, the optimum gate drive timing, and the condition of a low impedance drive voltage below the gate avalanche point. Furthermore, the scaling-up for high current assumes that the total current is shared by each elemental area at all times, Tests revealed that nonuiformity leads to shifting of load current during turn-off into on area which causes failure. With due consideration of these factors, a practical design and process for the high power GCS were developed. Data on developmental 50-ampere GCS's are presented."
"A new silicon power-transistor structure has been developed which expands the frontiers of power-switching performance and high-voltage power-handling capability. This new structure employs a unique π-ν (nearly intrinsic p- and n-type) epitaxial-layer construction which utilizes \"overlay\" emitter concepts to achieve improved volt-ampere densities and expanded second-breakdown performance. An n+-p-π-ν-n+transistor structure is constructed using alternately grown π and ν, epitaxial high-resistivity layers, p-type base and n+emitter diffusions are used in the conventional manner to assure punch-through protection. The depletion region for the n+-p-π-ν-n+transistor is in the π base and the ν collector, and the maximum electrical field (E_{\\max}) is at the π-ν interface. The avalanche breakdown VBof the device can be controlled by the thickness (X_{n}, X_{p}) and the concentration (N_{A}, N_{D}) of the π-ν layers. Limiting the thickness of the ν collector region and adjusting the thickness of the π base layer provides a transistor with optimum volt-ampere capability. Various π-ν structures have been fabricated and are evaluated electrically for power switching and for linear applications."
"This paper describes the efforts and results in developing a high-power transistor for single sideband application. Dependence of intermodulation distortion on device characteristics and usage is discussed. Emitter grid, interdigitated, and overlay structures are considered for the design with supporting evidence given for the eventual choice. An improved version of the original design was found necessary to meet the application requirements."
"Schottky-barrier diodes have been in use for some time, but, in the main, only for small-signal applications. Now a large area (17K mils2) Schottky-barrier diode has been successfully fabricated for use as a high-current rectifier. The device has a rated Io of 50 amperes. Measured values of forward voltage drop at 50 amperes (dc) are typically less than 500 mV. The inherent speed characteristics of this majority carrier device were indicated in the measurement of rectification efficiency versus frequency. The efficiency of the device remained unchanged through 500 kHz. A brief theoretical review of metal-semiconductor junctions is presented and applied to the empirical characteristics of the rectifier. Chip geometry, fabrication techniques, and complete device characteristics are discussed. Specific device applications are covered with emphasis on performance and limitations."
"Gallium solution epitaxy, using a steady-state, temperature-gradient technique has been successfully used to grow high-quality, 150-µM thick gallium arsenide layers with less than 5 percent variation in electron density. A laser-probe, photoconductivity method has been used to precisely measure the relative variations of electron density. Using these epitaxial layers with 1.5-2 ×1015cm-3electron concentration, LSA oscillations at X- and Ku-bands have been measured with up to 400-watt peak power and with more than 10 percent efficiency. A small iris circuit with a stepped ridge waveguide impedance transformer has delivered fundamental LSA oscillations in the X- and Ku-bands. Operating bias levels of up to 20 times threshold were observed on some diodes. The importance of the substrate (and contact) layer conductivity at the interface with the active layer, as well as the skin depth of the active layer, for efficiency and in preventing avalanche breakdown is explained. Frequency tuning with bias voltage and temperature is shown and discussed."
"This paper presents calculated and experimental results which demonstrate that the performance of IMPATT diodes is significantly improved by the use of diamond heat sinks. Oscillator test results on germanium IMPATT diodes at 6.2 GHz indicate about 50 to 100 percent increase in power output for diamond versus copper heat-sinked units without compromising other oscillator characteristics. An increase in thermal conductance of about 40 percent is realized for diodes mounted on selected high-conductivity diamonds compared to units mounted on copper. Considerations of IMPATT wafer design for optimum power performance on high thermal conductance heat sinks are discussed. Thermal conductivity of naturally occurring diamonds ranges from 1.0 to 5.0 times that of copper which necessitates selection of stones to realize maximum thermal conductance. This paper presents the results of a study of diamond thermal conductivity, its measurement, and its relationship to diamond optical properties. The dependence of diode thermal conductance on die area for diamond heat-sinked devices has been obtained by computer solution of the heat flow equations for the relevant geometries. These calculations have been corroborated by measurement of the thermal conductance of diodes with various die diameters."
"A lumped thermal resistance model is described for GaAs Gunn and LSA diodes. Thermal resistances are defined for the active layer, contact layer, bond interface, package and heat sink. This permits the calculation of tha maximum device temperature TM= T0+ P ΣiRiand the critical temperature difference across the active layer ΔTA= PRA. A transient analog incorporates thermal time constants Ti= RiCito consider high duty cycle pulsed operation. The carrier mobility is modeled as varying as1/Tin the range from 300 to 500°K. This permits thermal measurements based upon changes in resistance. The thermal calculations were also in agreement with blackbody infrared data. The mobility decline with temperature is shown to act as a link between the thermal profile and device performance. A thermally induced avalanching point, as well as device efficiency, are influenced by the peak-to-valley current ratio. This ratio is reduced from its theoretical value of over 2:1 by the active layer resistivity ratio\\bar{partial}/\\partial_{\\max}. Thus thermal gradients in the active layer act to create mobility gradients which alter the observed peak-to-valley ratio. The steps necessary for maintaining high average power efficient operation require low thermal resistances to minimize the active layer temperature gradients and a high current drop back ratio. Total experimental thermal resistances of 6.5°C/watt for an X-band CW diode and 17°C/watt for a thick LSA diode have been observed and fit the model presented."
"A technique is presented for accurately measuring and displaying the magnitude and time function of the exchange and absorption of electrical energy in linear and nonlinear circuit elements such as semiconductor power switches. A novel electronic wattmeter with a wide-band (dc to 10 MHz) linear multiplier is used to observe the instantaneous product of the time-varying voltage and current in an arbitrary load. Experimental data show that the peaks of power dissipation during the turn-on and turn-off phases of a switching power transistor are much greater than the power dissipated during the time intervals of settled current flow. Furthermore, it is verified experimentally that the average power dissipation increases linearly with the transistor pulse-repetition frequency beyond a static (dc) value. The absence of such a frequency-dependent component of power dissipation in switches of resonant-current circuits is also confirmed."
"The forward voltage drop Vfof an ac operating triac can be employed to indicate its junction temperature. The Vf, for a constant test current, is shown to decrease linearly with increasing temperature over the range of 20 to 125°C with measured slopes between -1.4 to -1.6 mV/°C. A sampling current must be used at the end of an applied power pulse and the cooling of the triac which takes place during the delay in measurement is taken into account by an extrapolation procedure. The indicated temperature using the Vfmethod is in excellent agreement With the maximum temperature measured with an infrared microradiometer at the surface of the active region of the triac. The Vftechnique requires a special power test circuit which is described. This technique provides an accurate indication of the maximum operating temperature and requires calibration of only a few triacs. Triac manufacturers can use the Vftechnique to accurately measure the thermal performance of their triacs and to screen production to eliminate marginal devices."
"A description is given for the use of the threshold gate trigger current (IGT) of an ac operating triac to indicate its junction temperature. Because of different triggering mechanisms, the IGTof the first-quadrant gating has been found to have a more consistent temperature dependence than that of third-quadrant gating. The temperature dependence of IGTcan be described by an empirical formula of the formI_{GT} = I_{GT_{0}} \\exp [-a(T - T_{0})]over the temperature range 25 to 125°C. The device constant a is generally of the order of 0.007 to 0.009 (°C)-1. Junction temperature measurements can be made for a device during either the cooling or the heating period using the threshold gate trigger current as a temperature-sensitive parameter. Temperatures indicated by this technique are compared to surface temperatures measured directly with an infrared microradiometer. The gate trigger current has been found to be an easy parameter to measure for triacs in a self-gating circuit during transient or steady-state operation; therefore, it can provide triac users with a convenient and relatively accurate method of evaluating the thermal performance of their triacs."
"Thermal analysis of power semiconductor devices is often complicated by odd geometries and the nonlinear properties of materials. It is the type of problem that can best be handled by a computer. Fortunately, numerous general-purpose heat transfer programs have been written that can be applied to power semiconductor deyices. The majority of programs were written for other technologies (aircraft engines, nuclear energy, and space) but they are sufficiently general for electronic applications. These programs are most often based on the method of finite differences. While this method can yield results to any degree of accuracy required, it is not readily apparent just how accurate the results are. In general, a user desires results as accurate as necessary while minimizing the cost of the problem solution. This paper deals with methods of achieving that goal. Descriptions of truncation and convergence errors are given along with methods of estimating their magnitude. Various forms of the finite difference method are discussed. Methods for speeding convergence are shown, including acceleration algorithms and simple guidelines for ordering matrices and selecting node boundaries. Convenient methods of displaying and interpreting the results are also discussed."
"Thermal feedback (TF) is an important aspect for the thermal management of semiconductor devices and high-power density integrated circuits. Different features of positive and negative TF in transistors are reviewed and summarized for the macroscopic domain. The thermal feedback mechanism is applied to the microscopic domain of noise fluctuations in semiconductor devices. It is argued that TF may be responsible for a major part of 1/fflicker or excess noise. Some experimental evidence is presented which supports this thermal feedback 1/f-noise theory for bipolar and MOS field effect transistors. Device and circuit design rules for the minimization of transmitter noise are given."
"Thermally induced second breakdown is studied in very small 6- to 10-volt silicon diodes having uniform breakdown. The formation of a small high-current density region is observed optically at the onset of thermal breakdown. Incremental resistance measurements can be used to determine nondestructively the threshold current for thermal breakdown. The threshold temperature for thermal breakdown is measured using the avalanche voltage temperature coefficient. The voltage drop associated with thermal breakdown is shown to be due to a sudden change in active area of the junction rather than to melting of the crystal."
"In silicon power transistor applications, thermal cycling of the transistor may activate a failure mechanism called thermal fatigue. This phenomenon is caused by the mechanical stresses set up by the differential in the thermal expansions of the various materials used in the assembly and heat sink of the transistor. Thermal fatigue often results in cracking of the silicon pellet or failure at the silicon mounting interface. This paper discusses the two types of interfaces encountered in power-transistor chip mounting. In type I (hard-solder) systems, the stress-strain relationship is treated in the elastic region. In type II (soft-solder) systems, the stress-strain relationship is plastic in that at least one component exhibits material flow. For the type I systems, a method is suggested for calculation of the forces acting at each interface. For type II systems, an empirical approach to predicting the number of cycles to failure is given. Accelerated testing techniques for thermal-fatigue evaluation are suggested, and a method of predicting performance for various mounting systems is given. This method uses an equation of the formN = A_{0}e^{(\\gamma0/H)}. This paper combines an analytical approach to the design of power transistors with an empirically derived method of predicting failure under conditions of thermal fatigue."
"A description is given of a method for estimating the fatigue lifetime of a solid-state power switch. The switch considered is a layered structure with a silicon wafer as a power-dissipating structure from which heat flows through a solder layer into a copper heat sink. Lifetime data and metallographic analyses are presented for devices operating at 80-, 60-, and 40-amperes rms with fatigue lifetimes in excess of 106cycles. The data are in substantial agreement with the theory."
"High-power mesa-type rectifiers were passivated with successive layers of SiO2and Si3N4by a low-temperature chemical vapor deposition technique. Reverse I-V characteristics, high-temperature yield, ancl blocking life test results are compared with values obtained with a polyimide coating. The high-temperature performance of the oxide-nitride passivated unit is found to be superior to the polyimide coated units. A strong correlation between the high-temperature leakage current and thermal stability of the device is noted."
"RF power transistors employing aluminum metallization can degrade and fail when the aluminum carries high-current densities at elevated temperatures. Two distinct mechanisms promoted by electromigration lead to failure. These are 1) the growth of etch pits filled with aluminum which penetrate and short the emitter-base junctions and 2) a reconstruction of the metallization which increases the electrical resistance reducing the device efficiency."
"This paper describes the physical phenomena which must be considered in designing a practical neutron-hardened n-p-v-n power transistor. It is shown that, in addition to resistivity increase in the collector and lifetime decrease in the base region, one must also consider increases in emitter-base space-charge recombination and decreases in emitter efficiency to completely characterize the device degradation. The most practical design for a high-voltage neutron-hardened power transistor may be one in which the base is allowed to extend into the collector at high-current densities in order to reduce the saturation vo1tages. Data are given for a 5-ampere 100-volt BVCEOdevice tolerant to 3×1014neutrons/ cm2(E >10 keV, fission spectrum)."
"This paper discusses the design features and test results of a thyristor power converter for high-voltage dc (HVDC) transmission for study of its practicability. It consists of a thyristor valve (which represents one arm of a bridge) with a bridge output of 100-kV dc. This valve features series use of 120 2.5-kV, 500-ampere thyristors and application of optoelectronics technology where luminous diodes and a light-sensitive device are employed for gate firing, overvoltage protection, and measurement of device-distributed voltage. The tests have confirmed the estimated usability of the thyristor for dc transmission, as well as the superiority and reliability of the optoelectronics. It has been found that the valve performs as designed. With thyristor voltage ratings of over 4 kV already developed in Japan, it is expected that the HVDC power converter will be extensively utilized in the very near future."

"This paper is concerned with several electrodynamic effects associated with the interaction of hypersonic waves with conduction electrons in crystals of n-type germanium. One aspect of this interaction involves the creation of coherent microwave current by a sound wave under the influence of a dc electric field. We study this aspect in relation to current oscillation, amplification, and traveling-wave effects with a view toward engineering applications. Electromagnetic radiation and internal transmission of energy are similarly discussed. We have constructed a model for the interaction of electron current with hypersonic waves (w \\geq 10_{9}) through shear-deformation potential coupling in moderately doped n-type germanium subject to a dc electric field. From a Boltzmann equation treatment of the charge transport, and a continuous-system Lagrange equation for the sound field, we obtained the dispersion relation. By means of the Bers-Briggs criteria, we found a convective instability (spatial growth) for10_{10} < w < 10_{12}for supersonic drift. Since no absolute instability (spontaneous oscillation) was detected, this interaction can provide stable amplification of ac electron current and of hypersonic waves. Or, if one is an input to the crystal, the other will be generated. The gain is of order hundreds of decibels per centimeter. Solving the eigenvalue problem yielded an infinite discrete set of complex frequencies whose imaginary parts indicated growth rates of order 107dB/s, which amounts to a usable gain of order 102dB. Finally, Maxwell's equations were used to estimate the electro-magnetic effects of the various electrodynamic instabilities. Sample calculations indicated current densities of order 10-1A/cm2."
"The transport equations and charge-control concepts are applied in an analysis of a static conductivity-modulation mechanism occurring in the collector region of n-p-ν-n power transistors. This results in an expression for collector-emitter saturation voltage as a function of terminal currents and device parameters. An expression is derived which describes the current gain characteristics of saturated epitaxial and triple-diffused devices. The analysis is also used to illustrate the relationship between the emitter metallization resistance, collector charge storage, and the turn-off crowding mechanism experienced by high-frequency saturating transistor switches. An analysis of a time-dependent collector conductivity modulation process is used to derive an expression which describes the repetition frequency dependence of the collector-emitter saturation voltage of an epitaxial (or triple-diffused) transistor switching a square wave of collector current. It is concluded that frequency-dependent edge-crowding mechanisms occur only at much higher frequencies than those considered in this study."
"Measurements are reported on the noise resistance and the noise conductance of the junction-gate FET in the temperature range 77°K-400°K. At low temperatures anomalous noise behavior has been observed. The measurements are discussed in the light of existing theories and, when necessary, the theoretical model has been extended. The agreement is satisfactory. Generally the extra noise is caused by mobility saturation, increased free-carrier temperature, free-carrier trapping and multiplication effects in the pinched-off region. Finally, several applications are discussed in relation to the limiting noise sources."
"The noise resistance of the field-effect transistor has been calculated taking into account high-field effects such as mobility saturation and hot carrier temperature upon the thermal noise. The result of the calculations can be represented by a practical formula. The calculated results have been compared with measurements of the noise of a junction gate FET and a MOS tetrode with short active channels. The agreement is reasonable. At room temperature the effect is moderate, but at low temperatures it is considerable."
"The program package which is applicable to solve problems of heat transfer in transistors or integrated-circuit chips or in their stems has been developed with a three-dimensional lumped network model. The thermal resistances of beam-lead transistors calculated with this program are found to be in good agreement with the observed values. For the better design of beam-lead devices, thermal resistances are evaluated with this program for various geometries of the chips and for the passivation films of 1-micron thick SiO2, 2-micron SiO2, and 0.2-micron Al2O3or Si3N4on 1-micron SiO2. The results calculated indicate that the thermal resistance is mainly dependent on the thickness of electroplated Au in the beam-lead structure, and that the heat dissipation is especially sensitive to the distance, which is measured along the beam lead from the chip edge to the nearest end of the joining part of the beam lead to the metallized conductor on the ceramic stem."
"Degradation of low current hFEas a result of avalanching the emitter-base junction of a silicon planar transistor is shown to be explinable by an increase in surface recombination velocity within the vicinity of the emitter-base metallurgical junction. This degradation mechanism manifests itself on a gate-controlled transistor by an additional peak in the plot of base current versus gate voltage. The magnitude as well as the \"width\" of this peak can be accounted for theoretically by assuming a given emitter-base impurity gradient and a localized increase in surface recombination velocity in and around the metallurgical junction. Experimental evidence is also presented for localized charge trapping within the oxide over the emitter-base junction as a result Of avalanching under an applied field."
"The influence of impurity distribution on the performance of high-efficiency silicon avalanche diode oscillators has been investigated for a number of diffusion profiles and doping densities of ionized donors. p+-n-n+mesa diodes with diameters ranging from 0.005 to 0.030 inch, were designed with abrupt, hyperabrupt, graded, and linearly graded junctions with doping densities varying from 1014to 2 × 1015cm-3and depletion region width 4 µm ≤ W ≤ 8 µm. The devices were operated at L-band with 40 percent efficiency. The high-frequency characteristics of the avalanche devices have shown that high-efficiency performance can be achieved with complex waveforms of current."
"An experimentally derived four-element incremental model for the avalanche region of a microwave negative-resistance diode and a simplified measuring procedure for determining the element values are presented. The element values depend on bias but not on frequency. The four-element model predicts the same frequency behavior as the theoretically derived Gilden-Hines model when one degree of freedom is eliminated. Comparison with theory predicts a simple low-frequency (1-MHz) indirect measurement of device drift region carrier transit time."
"A method has been proposed to deduce the energy distribution of interface states and the mobility ratio of carriers simultaneously from Hall effect measurements at two different temperatures. Using this method, the interface-state density Nssand the mobility ratiorof carriers were determined on both n-channel and p-channel silicon MOS transistors. The result indicates that Nssdetermined in this method is very small near the center of the energy gap and increases as the energy of the states approaches the band edges. The interface-state density inside the conduction and the valence band was found as high as 1013cm-2eV-1. The value of mobility ratio was found to depend both on temperature and surface-carrier density. Increase of mobility ratio with decreasing carrier density was observed in all samples, it is interpreted as due to diffuse scattering and to Coulomb scattering by localized interface charges."
"Although it is possible to optimize selected characteristics of semiconductor devices by controlling the net impurity distribution, present methods used for fabricating planar devices by diffusion techniques invariably produce profiles which are approximately either Gaussian or complementary error functions. The purpose of this paper is to examine the feasibility of obtaining a general impurity profile within intrinsic material using diffusion techniques. It is shown that by treating the problem as an optimum control problem, one can, in principle, obtain a best-fit approximation to a given profile by controlling the gas stream impurity concentration. A first-order model is developed to characterize the surface interactions between the gas ambient and the solid; the boundary value problem for diffusion is then solved. A computational routine using linear programming techniques is developed which, for a given diffusion time, determines the necessary control function producing a best-fit approximation to the desired profile over the spatial range of interest. The optimum control functions governing the diffusion of boron in silicon for three given impurity profiles are synthesized: a constant profile, an exponential profile, and the minimum transit time profile. The computational results clearly establish the feasibility of obtaining an approximation to a given impurity profile."
"In the first part of the paper the importance of the microwave circuit parameters on the attainment of LSA oscillation in ideal uniform devices is investigated. It is shown to be desirable for the circuit to have high-dynamic impedance. In consequence stray capacity at the device, due to the device configuration or to the mounting arrangement, is to be avoided. The existence of a capacityCin parallel with the cold-device capacity C0effectively raises the lower limit for LSA operation ton/f > 2 \\times 10^{4}[(C+C_{0})/C_{0}]. In the second part of the paper devices with typical doping and mobility profiles are considered to operate in circuits with low-dynamic impedance as well as in circuits with high-dynamic impedance. The results presented show that the LSA operating efficiency can be very sensitive to certain inhomogeneities, notably doping ramps of order 12½ percent and high-resistivity regions at the cathode contact. The efficiency degradation is, however, very dependent on the circuit in which the device is operating. Finally it is shown that the efficiency of a CW device may be raised by several percent in some cases by compensating for the mobility profile with a suitable doping gradient."
"A numerical technique is presented for calculating the resistance of two-terminal distributed resistors and the resistance matrix for multiterminal regions in integrated circuit layers. The technique, useful for computer-aided design of multiterminal resistors, makes use of Cauchy's integral formula which facilitates coordination of conformal transformations at Singular boundary points. Results for a simple test structure (16 boundary points, 0.07 percent error in conductance calculation, 1.8 seconds computation time on a GE 635 computer) indicate this technique to be faster than various published techniques on computation time versus accuracy basis. The technique is applicable to structures with boundaries consisting of straight lines and circular arcs, multiply-connected, multiterminal, and open structures."
"A Green's function technique for the computation of electric potentials in electrostatic systems of arbitrary configuration, especially with cylindrical symmetry, is developed. The system may include open boundaries and dielectric media. The integral equation is numerically solved by iteration. Its convergence is very fast. Computer calculated field and potential values are of high accuracy (usually better than 10-4). Errors in electron optical data, derived from trajectory computation, were found to be within fabrication tolerances of experimental systems. The computerized method proved to be an excellent tool for the design of electron optical systems, as electron image intensifiers."
"This paper briefly describes the experimental verification of the properties of a wide dynamic range crossed-field gun [1]. This gun, which is a combination of a Kino short gun (or it could be a Kino long gun) and a two-section transformer region, can be used to inject electron beams (with cathode current density varying over a wide range) into the interaction region under optimum conditions and under conditions of a fixed magnetic field. The beam injection level and its injection velocity can also be varied over a wide range by suitably adjusting the electric fields in the two sections of the transformer. The fabrication of the experimental tube is also briefly described."
"Plasma from a triggered electrical discharge between copper electrodes in a vacuum was rapidly expanded into an X-band microwave waveguide. Propagation was interrupted to >40-dB attenuation within 0.5 µs, and the interruption typically lasted from 1-100 µs, depending upon the pulsed arc current and switch geometry. Recovery to normal propagation occurred in less than 1 µs. Most of the microwave energy was reflected from the arc plasma, which might allow its use as a duplexer."
"The required trigger-pulse width and height for triggering a dipole domain in n-GaAs bulk devices were obtained analytically. Further switching properties of the three-terminal Gunn-effect digital devices have been made clear experimentally."
"This correspondence considers the impedance matching problem for self-resonant LSA diodes and concludes that large diode lengths are necessary to achieve minimal impedance levels required from circuit considerations. The length of a diode loaded by a concentric dielectric ring must be about 30 transit lengths to obtain a 1-ohm circuit impedance level and about 300 transit lengths to achieve ten ohms."
"A method is described for continuously measuring the pinch-off voltage VgTof FET structures as a function of time. This is of particular importance for the study of device instabilities."
 "The above-mentioned paper concludes that the symmetrical interdigital surface wave transducer cannot excite the third harmonic. It is shown that this conclusion, which is contrary to the experimental evidence, is a consequence of the approximations used."

"Electron-optical techniques were employed to fabricate planar silicon transistors having a 1-micron strip width and a combined dimensional and registration tolerance of 1000 Å. A new electron-sensitive positive resist was used to define a conventional oxide diffusion mask. The exposure equipment is described and electrical parameters of the complete device are given."
"An analysis of the open metallization problem at oxide steps at the surface of planar devices is described. This failure mechanism is essentially based upon the presence of a film discontinuity which grows during the evaporation process at the interface of coarse and dense crystal structures of the evaporated film. The growth rate of the coarse surface is somewhat larger than that of the normal surface. This mismatch in growth rates gives rise to the film discontinuity due to the self-shadowing effect by the former surface. The film discontinuity is apt to occur at the sharp step of phosphosilicate glass because of the following two reasons: 1) a large vapor-incidence angle to the perpendicular side wall; 2) a spontaneous growth of the coarse surface at the sharp edge of the step. Techniques investigated to improve the interconnection reliability include : 1) evaporation at elevated substrate temperature (∼300°C), 2) reduction of the thickness of phosphosilicate glass, 3)perpendicular vapor incidence to the substrate, and 4) protection of the discontinuity against corrosive agents."
"Current filaments have been observed in the post-breakdown region of two-carrier space-charge-limted diodes in silicon and gallium arsenide. An analytical expression for the radial distribution of current in such filaments has been derived using an appropriate model for the total current-electric field problem. This derived expression is solved numerically for semi-insulating GaAs. These analytical results are compared with the experimental observations."
"The analysis of noise in down-converters, in which signal and image ports are equally terminated, is extended to include the effect of a nonlinear junction capacitance. The theory is applied to Schottky-barrier diodes, which are represented by a constant resistance in series with a parallel combination of a nonlinear conductance and nonlinear capacitance pumped in phase. Using numerical optimization procedures, the minimum overall receiver noise figure, the associated conversion loss, and the required optimum external terminations are calculated and compared with experimental results. It is shown that in a resistive mixer with equal termination of signal and image ports, the addition of a nonlinear capacitance can lower the conversion loss substantially; but the overall noise figure remains nearly invariant. A conversion loss as low as 3.5 dB was measured (3.3 dB calculated) for a silicon Schottky-barrier diode operated at 3 GHz, driven by 0.1 mW LO power, and without dc bias. The overall noise figure, including an IF amplifier noise figure of 1.5 dB, however, stays at 5.7 dB (5.5 dB calculated)."
"A simple set of frequency scaling laws for the basic characteristics of IMPATT diodes is derived."
"Characteristics of several diode shutter tubes, useful for exposure time of 1 ns to 500 ns, are given. Addition of a microchannel electron multiplier between photocathode and screen makes possible higher and adjustable gain while retaining the advantages of high speed, small size, and high resolution. The transfer technique for making the photocathode and positioning it close to the microchannel wafer contributes to the performance of these new tubes."
"By assuming that the mesh holes are square and that the electron beams are Gaussian, both the sine-wave and the cross-scan response may be calculated for a mesh-type storage tube. The sine-wave response is the product of a function of the form\\sin x/x. from the mesh holes and a Gaussian function from the electron beams. Cross-scan response always exceeds sine-wave response; the resolution at 50 percent cross-scan response is 5/3 times the resolution at 50 percent sine-wave response. The signal current through a mesh hole is directly proportional to the area of the hole. Variations in mesh hole size from point-to-point on the mesh produce errors or disturbance on the output signal. For example, a peak-to-peak signal to peak-to-peak disturbance ratio of 20 dB requires that the variation in mesh hole width be ± 2.5 percent. The disturbance may be observed in the output of an electrical-output mesh storage tube by photographing 50 to 100 superimposed traces from a line-selector oscilloscope display."
"The potential energy stored in a bunched electron beam is calculated using analytical and numerical methods. The ratio of stored potential energy to the total beam energyW_{p}/W_{0}increases rapidly with the degree of bunching and with decreasing beam filling factorb/a.W_{p}/W_{0}is proportional to the beam perveance and independent of the beam voltage, as long as relativistic effects are neglected. In a velocity-modulated linear beam-type device, such as a klystron or a traveling-wave beam tube, stored potential beam energy affects both the bunching process and the process of dc to RE energy conversion adversely. For maximum conversion efficiencyW_{p}/W_{0}should be kept as low as possible. Several ways of reducingW_{p}/W_{0}are discussed."
"The dielectric behavior of thermally grown SiO2was examined using Si-SiO2-Cr structures. The relaxation spectrum exhibits a time dependence indicative of diminishing charge-carrier concentration. The relaxation process is characterized by activation energies of 29-32 kcal/mole; this, together with the considerably higher loss measured in specimens contaminated with Na2CO3, suggests sodium as the carrier source."
"Transmission-line analogs of the space-charge waves and the electroacoustic waves propagation in solid-state plasmas have been developed. Normal modes have also been defined. These transmission analogs provide the base for description of wave interactions in solid-state plasma by coupled-mode theory."
"Equations are developed for determining the temperature of a steady-state power flux source incident on the heat pipe as a function of the pipe wall thickness. The analysis shows the heat pipe to be no better than a semi-infinite heat sink operating at an elevated temperature for practical solid-state RF devices having power flux densities of 104-106watts/cm2."

 "In modern color television tubes, an array of three electron beams, converging at a target, is deflected through angles of up to 55°. The conventional, small-angle deflection theory cannot be extended to deal with the convergence defects of deflection fields at such large angles since certain series expansions, basic to that theory, diverge at angles larger than 45°. A new approach to the theoretical treatment of deflection defocusing effects in cathode-ray tubes, based on the application of the theory of \"focusing fields with arbitrary curved optical axes\" leads to a quantitative description of deflection defects at any angle of deflection. Deflection astigmatism and curvature of field will appear in this approach as paraxial effects, while deflection coma will be identified as a second-order aberration. The mathematical treatment presented, here is suitable for numerical evaluation of deflection fields and their defects with the aid of computers."
"Starting conditions of backward-wave oscillators are obtained both analytically and numerically for large loss and large space charge. Analytical results are obtained for zero loss and space charge up to infinity and for zero space charge and loss up to infinity. Computer results are carried out for circuit loss up to 225 dB and space charge up to QC = 25. An analytical equation is developed for computing starting conditions for large loss approaching infinite values and for large space charge approaching infinite values. Since the starting C is proportional to the loss per wavelength, large values of loss in a backward-wave oscillator can prevent oscillation from occurring unless the current can be made sufficiently large; i.e., the starting C is independent of length."
"An investigation has been completed of the use of a gas-tube attenuator to protect a maser from saturation when used in a pulsed radar. A typical X-band unit will provide well over 100 dB isolation while introducing only 0.05 dB attenuation in the receiver line. Characteristics including recovery time, life, firing delay, striations, leakage power, tube voltage, etc., as a function of current and gas fill for xenon and neon are presented. These attenuators have been used successfully in two different radar systems over a period of several years."
"A theoretical analysis is presented of the effects of intervalley transfer time, travel of an accumulation layer, and dipole domain growth upon LSA mode operation of GaAs devices. A modified two-valley model is used with energy relaxiation effects included to analyze a crystal divided into an active section (above threshold electric field) and a passive section (below threshold field) by an accumulation layer. Domain growth occurs in the active section. Specific results are given for crystal lengths of 20 µm and 100 µm and the influence of crystal parameters and operating conditions upon the conversion efficiency and devices RF admittance is discussed."
"A theoretical and experimental investigation into a particular type of tunable microwave circuit commonly used for LSA operation of GaAs layers is reported. It is shown that certain effects which often impose severe limitations on the performance of wide-band transferred-electron oscillators (TEO's) such as frequency saturation, fixed frequency operation, resonance switching, deterioration of efficiency, and high FM noise may, in many instances, be attributed directly to the interaction of the equivalent circuit of the encapsulated device and the microwave circuit. The theoretical result are used to deduce design criteria for a J-band (11 to 19 GHz) waveguide circuit in order to optimize the performance of the oscillator with respect to tunning range, efficiency, and FM noise performance. In particular the results of the investigation indicats that, for continuous tuning combined with low FM noise over the tuning range, the parallel resonant frequency associated with the encapsulated device should be less than the minimum operating frequency, and that, by suitable design of the oscillator, frequency deviation due to fluctuation in the magnitude of the device capacitance can, in principle, be reduced to zero over a narrow bandwidth."
"This paper presents the result of an investigation aiming to clarify the large-amplitude oscillation mechanisms of a Si avalanche diode with high efficiency, a part of which was already reported in [6], by varying circuit conditons and the shapes of applied voltage pulses. Applying a pulse resistive, transient voltage across and current through the diode have been observed by varying the rise time of the source voltage. As a result, variations of these waveforms have been revealed with decreasing the rise time and if the slope of the diode voltage at the breakdown is large than 100 V/ns, damping oscillation has been observed with the amplitude increasing proportionally to this slope. This damping oscillation plays a significant role in initiating the stable large-amplitude oscillation. Using a resonant cavity, voltage and current waveforms at various points have been observed and analyzed for various cavity lengths and applied source voltages. The analysis shows that the voltage wave-form across the diode coincides with the superimposed waveforms of the wave incident on and the wave reflected from the diode, the latter being delayed about 60 ps with respect to the former. This oscillation mechanism is considered to be very close to the TRAPATT oscillation. The details of experimental results, oscillation characteristics, and their analyses are explained."
"The use of low temperature phosphosilicate glass (PSG) films which are compatible with aluminum-metallized integrated circuits, has been found to possess significant merits in LSI applications. PSG used on integrated circuits fabricated in production has resulted in improvements in fabrication yields and device performance and reliability. The properties and effects of PSG which contribute to these benefits have been determined and studied. They include hardness, ability to getter alkali ions, effect on immobile charge density, ability to quench fast states, low stress, resistance to cracking, low pinhole density, and effect on electromigration. The deposition system used to deposit the PSG films and the phosphorus content of the films are also discussed."
"A novel process for the formation of thin-film, optical-quality conductive electrodes for use in electrophoretic deposition of high-resolution phosphor screens is described. The thin-film metal electrodes can be removed from under the phosphor either chemically or by vacuum sublimation leaving a completely transparent interface. The metal electrodes show good adherence to substrates and are low in pinhole density. High condensation rates are obtained through the use of nucleation techniques."
"An experimental thin-film CdS:CdSe photoconductordiode array having 80 × 12 elements has been fabricated by vacuum deposition on a single 4 × 8 inch substrate. Element spacing is the same as the hole positions in a standard computer punched card. Possible applications include static and dynamic card readers."
"It is shown that for a two-sided junction, the doping profile can only be uniquely determined from C(V) measurements if the doping profile is known on one side. Expressions are derived which enable the calculation of the complete doping profile from C(V) measurements and the knowledge of the doping profile on one side."
"The theoretical computation of the drain characteristics of junction field-effect transistors reported by Kim and Yang has been compared with the experimental measurements in terms of the differential drain resistance. Good agreement between the theory and experiment has been found."
"A traveling wave technique to measure the dispersion charateristics of slow-wave circuits is described which uses a sensitive phase measurement system and negates the requirment for shorting the circuit under test. Because of the elimination of the short and because the sensitivity of the measurement does not require strong coupling to the circuit fields, errors due to the creation of spurious modes are minimized. Comparison of wavelength measurements using this system with those of previous techniques show excellent agreement."

"There is a growing interest in the development of devices that can efficiently convert electrical energy into light, particularly visible light. Of special interest is the possibility that such devices may be electrically and, hopefully, even physically compatible with existing electrical devices, particularly integrated circuits. Currently available semiconductor light-emitting diodes approach this ideal. For efficient electrical → optical power conversion at visible frequencies, the semiconductor bandgap must be ≳ 1.8 eV, which rules out silicon and even gallium arsenide. In this talk, the general physical guidelines developed recently for the selection of doped semiconductors that can produce efficient near-bandgap luminescence will be reviewed. In particular, attention will be given to the relative potentialities of direct and indirect gap semiconductors and the extent to which these potentialities have been realized, mainly in III-V compounds and their alloys."
"New technologies have emerged in the development of high-frequency transistors, and some of the old technologies have been considerably refined and extended. New equipment and measurement techniques have been perfected that allow rapid and accurate device characterization at microwave frequencies. As a result of these developments, the list of small-signal and power transistors available for use as amplifiers and oscillators to frequencies as high as 8 GHz has grown dramatically in recent years."
"The rate at which energetic electrons lose energy to a solid via phonons and various electronic excitations plays a key role in such devices as solid-state photomultipliers, Gunn oscillators, avalanche diodes, cold cathodes, negative-affinity emitters, and acoustoelectric amplifiers, and in such phenomena as electron mobility, current saturation, and dielectric breakdown. A semiclassical model for the rate of loss of energy will be presented that is conceptually simple and graphic and that provides a valid quantitative guide for analysis."
"Studies of integrated IGFET bucket-brigade charge-transfer shift registers show that charge-transfer efficiency depends on IGFET output conductance, on magnitude of the transferred charge, and on clock voltage waveforms. In a 64-device register, charge-transfer efficiency of 99.8% per stage has been achieved at 1 MHz with a structure that minimizes IGFET output conductance. An important operating constraint is that the register must always carry a small circulating charge, otherwise charge transfer efficiency is greatly impaired."
"A 256-bit static COS/MOS (complementary symmetry MOS) random-access memory chip has been fabricated with a 30 mil2cell and a chip size (0.110 × 0.128 inch) basically comparable to that of single-channel static MOS memories. Complementary MOS layouts with both p-channel and n-channel MOS transistors have generally required more area than single-channel MOS devices. A favorable memory cell circuit symmetry and modified layout rules can, however, permit the advantages of a complementary technology without areal penalty."
"The Cogar 1024-bit MOS read-write memory chip is fully decoded, has a 100-ns access time, and is only 125 × 125 mils in size. This small size is made possible by the use of a 4-device memory cell and dimensional tolerances as small as 0.15 mil. The chips are fabricated from a 2.25-inch-diameter wafer that consists of a low-resistivity p-type substrate covered by a high-resistivity p-type epitaxial layer. This epitaxial layer provides not only for precise control of surface impurity concentration, but also provides means for a reach-through type of gate protection device. In addition, the low-resistivity substrate tends to minimize unwanted noise voltages due to pulse currents flowing through the substrate."
"Charge-storage effects in MNOS structures have been investigated with regard to application in programmable read-only semiconductor memories utilizing the insulated-gate field-effect transistor as the active circuit component. The surface-potential dependence of both base and collector current in a suitably designed bipolar transistor, however, can be combined with the charge storage effects of the MNOS gate to provide a programmable bipolar transistor. By means of the stored charge in an MNOS gate over the emitter-base junction of a bipolar transistor, the base surface beneath the gate can be stably shifted from accumulation to inversion with the inversion layer beneath the gate of a suitably designed transistor acting as an efficient extention of the emitter junction. This results in a designable increase in collector cmrent at fixed forward emitter-base bias. Examples of both n-p-n and p-n-p transistors performing in this manner are given. The principal advantage of this type of device over conventional MNOS devices lies in its inherent higher transconductance. Performance comparisons between the read speed of conventional MNOS devices and that of the bipolar MNOS will be presented."
"A bipolar stored-charge memory cell will be described that consists of a single transistor with an MOS capacitor between emitter and ground. The transistor serves as a bidirectional switch allowing charge to selectively flow into or out of the storage capacitor. The cell requires periodic refreshing of the stored charge since electron-hole generation in the depletion region of the emitter tends to discharge it. However, because most of the charge is stored on the MOS capacitor, storage times of several seconds at room temperature should be expected."
"A description of the design of a reliable, inexpensive, transfer-molded, silicone plastic transistor encapsulation is given. The materials selection was based upon the needs of reliability testing and suitability for requisite manufacturing processes. The dimensions of the plastic encapsulation, which replaces the TO-18 hermetically sealed metal-glass encapsulation, were determined by analyzing the stresses at the interface of the plastic encapsulant and the metal leads. The physical and mathematical models of the lead seal and a mechanical-failure criterion were used to determine the integrity of the lead seal. Results of mechanical and electrical evaluations are given to demonstrate the capability and reliability of the encapsulation."
"It has been known that a reduction in the isolation capacitance and the storage time of an integrated bipolar transistor could be achieved by the introduction of gold in silicon. The process of gold introduction requires a final high-temperature cycle after emitter diffusion to reactivate the gold, which in turn makes it difficult to control the base width of a shallow-junction transistor with a phosphorus emitter."
"Silicon n-p-n transistors with gain-bandwidth, fT, of 13 GHz and current gain β of 280 have been fabricated by using arsenic capsule diffusion to produce the emitter region. Devices have been fabricated With the same epitaxial and diffusion processes up to emitter diffusion, and then emitter regions were formed by either arsenic or phosphorus diffusion. For the same mask geometry, devices with an arsenic emitter showed 60% improvement over those with a phosphorus emitter in fTand β under the condition of similar intrinsic base sheet resistance, which is a measure of total impurity in the active base region under the emitter. For comparable base width, arsenic-emitter devices show much higher collector punch-through voltage. Experimental data on a comparison between various dc and ac characteristics and circuit speed with these two types of devices will be presented as will data on various emitter geometries with arsenic emitter diffusion."
"Nonlinear distortion in a bipolar transistor amplifier is calculated using a new compact model to represent the transistor. Nonlinear distortion is particularly important for transistor applications in long-haul analog communications repeater amplifiers. In that case the internally generated output powers at the second and third harmonics relative to the power at the fundamental frequency should be as small as possible, The compact model is capable of predicting with any desired sensitivity the experimentally observed second- and third-order distortion coefficients."
"Burst noise in bipolar junction transistors has been attributed to leakage current through crystallographic defects located in proximity to the base-emitter junction. The current is modulated by the random occupancy of a single flaw located near the defects. The previous theoretical work has only described defects located in the emitter-base space-charge region away from the surface. This paper extends the noise model to include the regions close to the surface where the high incidence of defects makes burst noise sources more likely. Experimental data is presented on typical devices, some of which were gold doped. The proposed model is in agreement with all experimental measurements. The data, in conjunction with the noise model, is used to determine physical parameters such as capture cross sections and energy level of the flaw which correlate well with published values. The investigation suggests several techniques which are useful in reducing the incidence ot burst noise."
"1/fnoise in n-p-n silicon planar transistors is shown to have two sources. One of these sources is associated with the recombination centres that determine low-current hFEand are situated where the emitter-base depletion region meets the silicon-silicon-dioxide interface. The same relationship between hFEand 1/fnoise is established for, (1) batches of production transistors with suitable processing, (2) devices in which the gain and 1/fare changed as a result of biasing a gate electrode over the emitter base oxide, and (3) devices in which the gain and 1/fnoise have been changed as a result of emitter-base avalanche stressing."
"A detailed analysis has been performed for neutron-irradiated p+-n junction diodes to determine the influence of the recombination model, doping profile, and operating point on the minority carrier recombination throughout the devices. The calculations give the recombination rate, carrier distributions, and electric field in the various device regions and separate the device current into its space-charge-region recombination and diffusion components. At low bias levels, where space charge region recombination dominates, both the calculations and experimental data on irradiated devices show that the recombination current can be greatly reduced by employing heavy base doping in the vicinity of the junction."
"Over 1000 watts of CW power has been generated with a multisection krypton arc lamp pumped Nd:YAG laser. Applying electro-optical Q-switching techniques that are unique to this high-gain CW device, pulses with peak powers greater than 5 megawatts have been produced at repetition frequencies of 400G pps. The dynamics of the rapid pulse growth results in a pseudo-mode-locked pulse envelope. Through a combination of Q switching and injection of seed pulses from a CW mode-locked Nd:YAG laser, peak powers of several hundred megawatts can be produced, with average powers greater than 500 watts. Application of this output format to high average power second-harmonic generation will be discussed."
"A pulsed liquid laser operating at 5 pulses per second and an average power of 100 watts has been developed. The laser material consists of Nd-trifluoroacetate dissolved in POCl3acidified with ZrCl4. The concentration of Nd is 0.3 mole/liter The fluorescence lifetime of the solution is in excess of 300 µsec and the dynamic loss in the circulating medium is 0.0035 cm-1."
"The results of an erbium laser materials and systems investigation are presented. Studies include optical properties and laser system parameters of yb3+-sensitized YAG:Er and glass: Er and their relationship to the optimization of laser host materials and laser system design. Optical properties discussed include absorption, fluorescence, and excitation spectra, as well as fluorescence lifetimes; these properties will be related to actual laser performance data. An experiment was conducted to determine the emission cross section for YAG:Er, Yb, which is compared with cross sections of ruby and YAG:Nd. the Q-switched laser performance of the optimized compositions of YAG:Er,Yb and glass:Er, Yb are presented. Projections are made concerning the potential of the erbium laser in reducing the eye-safety problem and the expectation for applications to target range finding and illumination."
"In this paper we report on work, using both cooled(\\sim77\\degK)and room-temperature incoherent GaAs1-xPxdiodes (obtained from Texas Instruments, Inc.), that demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining room-temperature CW operation of a YAG:Nd laser with presently available diodes. Measurements have been made with diodes emitting at 0.81 µm that are coupled to a YAG:Nd laser rod by a semi-elliptic cylindrical reflector. The reasons for this choice of coupling geometry will be discussed together with some other possibilities."
"Several recent studies have compared xenon and krypton discharges as optical pumps for CW Nd:YAG lasers. Above 50 joules, xenon is reportedly more efficient, and in the 15-50 joule range, krypton has been found to be more efficient. We have compared the laser efficiencies obtained using pulsed discharges in xenon and krypton at pressures up to 3000 Torr and repetition rates up to 350 pps. Input energy was varied over the 0.5 to 10 joule range at pulse widths of 20, 100, 240, and 500 microseconds. Effects of pump-bore diameters of 1.7, 2.3, and 5 mm and bore lengths of 30 and 50 mm were evaluated using a quartz envelope--moly ribbon foil seal tube design and a keep-alive mode of operation. A 6-inch-diameter gold-coated sphere was used as the cavity for laser rods of 3, 5, and 6.25 mm diameter. Efficiency was found to increase with gas pressure up to 3000 Torr. A maximum efficiency of 1.8% was obtained with krypton, which, depending on current density, was generally found to be 20% better than xenon."
"Thermal gradients that occur ill optically pumped YAG lasers result in bifocusing and birefringence. Methods to compensate for these induced aberrations have been suggested by Osterink and Foster. We have employed one of these methods that uses 90° rotation of the polarization. A crystal quartz rotator is placed between two pumped YAG rods so that the part of the mode that is radially polarized in the first rod is tangentially polarized in the second. The experimental set-up consists of a 50-cm convex mirror, two flat ended 3 × 50 mm krypton-pumped Nd: YAG rods separated by the rotator and a 10-m concave output mirror. The dimensions of the cavity are such that the TEM00mode should be apertured by the rod diameters when their focal lengths are 50 cm each. The rod-lamp combinations have this focal length at a 1.5 kW input to each. The multimode output power at this input is 9 W with long-radius mirrors. With the above set-up the output is 6 W in the TEM00mode. Insertion of a Brewster plate results in a linearly polarized mode in a ratio of 30:1 with less than 10% loss of power. Variation of the power input to one of the lamps results in an increase in the crossed polarization component and shows that compensation is achieved by this technique. It is possible to obtain similar polarizations without loss of power for the multimode operation. In an attempt to reduce focusing effects, the pump radiation was filtered with a pass band from 0.66 to 1.33 microns, but no significant change in the observed focal length of the YAG rod was observed."
"Techniques have been developed that have made it possible to combine (in a miniature ceramic-metal vacuum envelope) a boron-implanted silicon diode, which serves as the output end of the structure, and a grid-controlled planar electron-tube structure, which is used as an electron-beam input source."
"In this paper basic analytical and experimental results are presented for ultrafast amplifiers, pulse generators, and pulse-detection systems in which a modulated electron beam controls the current in a semiconductor target. The lumped target amplifier is discussed frst, and results are summarized from a simplified analysis of target response to step-function beam excitation. The optimization of amplifier rise time and peak output level is illustrated and predicted target gain, rise time, peak output current, voltage, and power capabilities are shown graphically. The feasibility of a subnanosecond-rise-time pulse amplifier with a peak output power of 100 kW is shown."
"A computer program has been developed that permits detailed calculations of the electrical output and corresponding internal effects in the operation of an electron-beam-excited semiconductor device. The computer analysis complements the simple analytical treatment of target operation previously available, and makes possible the evaluation of high-level target operation with any or all of the following effects: (1) arbitrary input waveform, (2) arbitrary pair creating profile, (3) operation where electrons and holes contribute significantly to the target current, (4) non-constant carrier velocity, (5) arbitrary profile of drift region doping, and (6) non-resistive load impedance. These effects often appear in practical target design, especially for high-current, picosecond-rise-time amplifying devices."
"This paper describes the design and testing of developmental electron-beam semiconductor devices as dc pulse and r-f pulse amplifiers. These devices employ a well-focused elcetron beam deflected in proportion to the input signal to control the current in the semiconductor target. Both Class A and Class B amplifier configurations are described with a prediction of their relative efficiency and distortion properties. The use of lumped and traveling-wave deflection systems is considered."
"To identify in detail the factors that limit the average power capability of the cold-cathode r-f triggered crossed-field amplifier, a research tube has been built and tested. The research tube features segmented collector and delay line to measure current and velocity distribution along the beam. An independent cheek on beam distribution is provided by a row of x-ray dimples--thin metal and beryllium-covered pinholes in the side wall for x-radiation indication of bombardment on the line or collector. A slide will be shown of the images so obtained in the region of the output where some kind of undesired and quite complex discharge is seen to occur. The tube is also provided with three optical windows and four r-f probes, in addition to the normal input and output. The optical windows show the expected cathode fluorescence, and the window nearest the output also shows a glow in the delay line that probably has the same cause as the x-ray pattern."
"For the past several years Litton has pursued the development of linear format, nonre-entrant, self-modulated crossed-field amplifiers (CFA). From this work there have evolved high-performance, forward-wave slow-wave structures and excellent cold, secondary-emission cathodes. This paper describes the application of these slow-wave structures and cold cathodes to re-entrant-beam, circular-format, cathode-pulsed CFA's. The design of the circular-format CFA is comparable to that of existing linear-format DEMATRONS. Thus for the first time a direct comparison between these two types of amplifiers can be made."
"A fast-acting millimeter-wave switch has been developed that uses an argon-hydrogen plasma as the active element and has a high switching ratio over the 60 to 96 GHz frequency band. Measurements using low-amplitude electromagnetic probing waves have shown isolation to be over 40 dB at moderate plasma densities and over 60 dB at high plasma densities. Cold loss and VSWR are under 1 dB and 1.2, respectively. The time required for the r-f isolation to rise from cold loss to 20 dB (the switch-on time) is 2 microseconds and the time required for the r-f isolation to fall from 20 dB to 3 dB (the switch-off time) is 2 microseconds. Carefully measured isolation values at low plasma density (\\sim 7.2 \\times 10^{14}/cm3) were extrapolated to show that isolation of 70 dB at 75 GHz and 35 dB at 90 GHz is achieved."
"A photoemissive image converter that transforms optical images into hard copy has been designed and evaluated. The device is powered by a single dc potential and requires no focus or deflection. The image converter consists of a vacuum envelope containing an input window, a collector anode, and-an array of fine metal pins sealed through a wall of the device. By selective deposition, separate photocathodes are simultaneously deposited onto the inside end of each one of the thousands of pins in the array, making each one individually photosensitive."
"Certain nematic liquid crystals exhibit strong small-angle scattering of light in the presence of an electric field. This \"dynamic scattering\" has been exploited in both directly viewed and projected displays, in which different electric fields are applied to different picture elements. One way of applying these fields is through a photoconductor in series with each picture element; the amount of dynamic scattering at each picture element is then controlled by the amount of signal light falling on the corresponding photoconductor. The voltages (tens of volts) and currents (µA/cm2) involved are quite modest compared to those used in conventional photoconductor-electroluminescent panel light amplifiers. Furthermore, the scattered or \"projection\" light may be very bright since it is derived from an external source; its intensity is limited only by heating in the liquid crystal cell due to absorption. Consequently, the gain and output light level may be very large compared to those of conventional light amplifiers. The design of practical light valves centers on preventing projection light from activating the photoconductor. Cells have been made in which: 1) the photoconductor is insensitive to the wavelength of the projection light; and 2) an opaque barrier prevents projection light from entering the photoconductor. Resolutions in excess of 5 lines per mm have been achieved in very simple cells in which the active elements are in the form of continuous thin layers. Experimental results on the gain and sensitivity will be presented."
"Advances made in the design, construction, and characteristics of microchannel-plate inverter image intensifiers are described and their use in electro-optical systems is discussed. Particular emphasis will be placed on the electron optics and on the electron-lens/microchannel-plate interface design requirements. Proximity focusing is shown to be a logical choice for the microchannel-plate/phosphor-screen output section."
"An image-sensing and memory device is described that photoconductively converts and electrostatically stores optical images at the interface between a UV-sensitive ZnS film and associated blocking electrode. Optical readout is accomplished by means of the Pockels electro-optic effect generated in the ZnS film by the electrostatic image. A high ratio of UV to visible photosensitivity (approximately 105:1 between 340 and 630 nm) allows pseudo-nondestructive readout of the stored image pattern."
"The Ruticon is a solid-state cyclically reuseable image-recording device. It has a layered structure consisting of a conductive transparent substrate, a thin photoconductive layer, a thin deformable elastomer layer, and a deformable electrode such as a conductive liquid, a conductive gas, or a thin flexible metal layer. When an electric field is placed between the conductive substrate and the deformable electrode the elastomer will deform into a surface relief pattern corresponding to the light-intensity distribution of an image focused on the photoconductor. Light modulated by the deformation of the elastomer surface can in turn be converted to an intensity distribution similar to the original image by means of simple optics."
"A chevron channel electron multiplier is a device that combines the high pulse-saturated electron gain capabilities of a single channeltron with the imaging capabilities of microchannel arrays. The chevron is made from two microchannel plates, each of which is sliced so that the channel axis is at an angle with the array axis. The two arrays are then joined to form an array of channels, each with a bend along its length. Pulse-saturated gains of more than 107have been achieved without ion feedback; dark counts less than 10 counts/cm2/s have been observed; a Gaussian gain distribution is produced with 100% width at half maximum; unsaturated output current capabilities are in the 10-6A/cm2range or 3 × 105counts/s at 2 × 107gain; and limiting resolution capabilitiies are 5 lp/mm. These devices can be exposed to air without harm to the multiplying surface. Imaging areas over two inches in diameter are possible. The Bendix channeltron glasses are sensitive to ultraviolet and soft x-ray photons, electrons, beta particles, and ions."
"An aluminum-aluminum-oxide alloy conductor has been developed that has a higher resistance to electromigration than does a normal aluminum conductor. The electrical resistivity of this alloy is similar to that of normal aluminum. Also, because of the extremely fine and uniform grain size, the alloy shows superior land etching characteristics as well as uniformity and ease of opening via-holes in the insulating glass layer over the conductor. These advantages make possible dramatic improvement in product life and in circuit density for interconnections of monolithic integrate circuits. Also, the absence of hillocks on the conductor film make it attractive for devices using multilevel metallization."
"Beam-lead MOS devices have been fabricated using the planar interconnection method, which consists of Al interconnection paths buried in an alumina layer. The technique offers improvement in the threshold stability, packing density, and thermomechanical stress, and freedom from external ionic contamination. The technique is uniquely suited to MOS dynamic memories because of improved integrity of the interconnection paths, lower leakage currents, and improved stability of electrical parameters. This paper illustrates the advantages of the technique through a detailed comparison with conventional MOS methods for constructing a dynamic memory."
"Aluminum interconnect systems have become commonplace in the integrated circuit industry. Anodic processing of such systems takes advantage of the ease with which the aluminum metal conductor can be converted to an effective dielectric insulator for both single- and multilevel interconnect structures."
"Accelerated life data are presented on several integrated-circuit metallization systems including Al, Mo-Au, Ti-Pt-Au, and a new system W:Ti-Au, where the r-f-sputtered W:Ti layer is a pseudo-alloy of 10-20% Ti in W. Life tests include total water immersion, high-pressure steam, and 85°C/85% RH/bias on bare and plastic-encapsulated devices. Heat age and resistivity-ratio data are presented showing the metallurgical stability of the W:Ti-Au system. In order of decreasing corrosion resistance, Ti-Pt-Au > W:Ti-Au > > Mo-Au ≥ Al."
"The conventional slow-scanning electron-microscope system has permitted limited monitoring of dynamic events. The information is recorded on sheet photographic film requiring 30-60 sec exposure time. A newly developed rapid-scan electron-microscope system that operates at conventional TV scan rates permits real-time observation of physical mechanisms and electrical effects."
"X-band Gunn oscillators and silicon and gallium arsenide IMPATTS are commercially available; each ihas its particular set of operating characteristics. Often, applications engineers are unaware of subtle differences between these oscillators differences that, depending on use, could cause considerable difficulty with power-supply oscillation or excessive system noise."
"Double-drift-space IMPATT diodes made of ion implantation have been shown to offer advantages over conventional IMPATT structures. Recent advances in fabrication techniques have led to improved performance for the new structure, and in this paper comparative results are reported for single- and double-drift-space diodes designed for 50-GHz CW oscillator operation. The maxim am output power obtained from a double-drift is 1 watt, compared to 0.53 watt for single-drift doides. A maximum efficiency of 14.2% (at 0.93 watt) is obtained for the double-drift diode and 10.4% (at 0.46) watt) for the single-drift diode. The power-frequency-squared figure of merit for the double-drift device is the highest obtained for any CW IMPATT diode in any frequency range. All measurement techniques and process steps were the same for both types of units. The only significant difference is in the structure of the device: p+-p-n-n+compared with p+-n-n+. Ion implantation was used to make the p region of the 50- GHz double-drift structure. Static characteristic measurements are compared with calculations to determine the doping and to indicate the desired doping for frequencies up to 110 GHz. Preliminary experimental results for 100-GHz operation have been obtained for double-drift structures with both p and n regions implanted and will be given."
"New high power LSA results have produced over 2000 watts of peak power at over 10% efficiency in C-band from a single chip. Such results were made possible by recent breakthroughs in circuit analysis, and with the production of extremely uniform epitaxial layers of uo to 250 µm in thickness. Over 60% of the devices from such a wafer yielded in excess of 500 watts in similar operation."
"Gunn-effect oscillators have been developed for operation in the 40-60- GHz range. The diodes are in hermetically sealed, low-reactance packages and the oscillators operate stably over a Wide temperature range. Rectangular waveguide resonators are used with iris coupling to the output waveguide. A sapphire tuning rod. tunes the oscillator over a bandwidth of several percent. The diodes, with threshold voltages in the 1.2- to 1.8-volt range, are operated in the transit-time mode, and are made from solution-grown epitaxial gallium arsenide with a doping of around 5 × 1015carriers per cm3."
"The purpose of the present paper is to show experimentally the effect of circuit parameters and environmental conditions on the performance characteristics of a Gunn oscillator, especially electronic tuning, noise, and stability. The temperature is the most serious factor limiting the stability of the oscillator. By utilizing temperature-compensation methods as well as paralleled devices, the overall frequency deviation of a 300 mW Ku-band Gunn oscillator has been reduced to 4 × 10-4for the temperature range from -30°C to +60°C. Also described are the Gunn oscillators that operated successfully in a practical TV relay link as early as 1968."
"Recent publications discussed the effects of operating bias and circuit loading on the stability of transferred-electron amplifiers. During the course of our work on pulsed devices we found that it is not always possible to obtain stability by controlling the bias or circuit loading. However, by increasing either the ambient temperature or duty factor, some of the devices could be stabilized."
"Research on several different types of high-power N2-CO2electric-discharge convection lasers (EDCL) has been in progress at the United Aircraft Research Laboratories since early 1967. The performance characteristics of one of these lasers, the coaxial EDCL, is described. The distinctive feature of the EDCL is the removal of heat (and, hence, prevention of thermal population of the 100 level of the CO2) from the laser cavity by gas convection rather than by wall cooling as in conventional N2-CO2lasers. The geometry of the coaxial EDCL is similar to the conventional N2-CO2lasers, with the flow, electric discharge, and optical cavity essentially aligned along the axis of a cylindrical laser tube. However, the EDCL is substantially shorter in length than conventional lasers with comparable power output. Results of experiments utilizing a high-Q optical resonator to determine the effects of flow conditions and discharge parameters on laser performance at the multikilowatt level are described. Also the performance characteristics of the EDCL in open- and closed-cycle operation are compared."
"Axial mode selection in ring resonators using diffraction gratings as beam splitters and output couplers is described. Such a ring resonator is suitable for use at high average power levels, especially at infrared wavelengths for which partially transmitting optics are not available. By proper choice of grating blaze angles, the selectivity of the resonator can be adjusted over a wide range of values. The diffraction gratings serve simultaneously as beam splitters to provide axial mode selection, as output couplers, and as wavelength selection elements."
"In the cross-field laser, the premixed gas flow is channeled transveres to the stabilized electrical discharge column. The crossed magnetic field, mutually perpendicular to the discharge axial electric field and the gas flow velocity, is used to stabilize the discharge parallel with the optical axis of the resonator. The cross-field laser has been operated as the first CW premixed electrically initiated chemical laser. Laser action was achieved on both HF and DF rotational-vibrational transitions by initiating a discharge in H2, SF6, and He, and D2, SF6, and He, respectively. HF output powers of 0.8 watt have been achieved. Power output and gain are given as a function of flow velocity for the various gas mixtures. The experimental results of a parametric study on the dependence of gain, power output, and required magnetic field upon the gas mixtures, flow velocities, and operating pressures of a CO2cross-field laser are presented. Gains up to 5% cm-1and power outputs greater than 540 W have been obtained. Although the laser has been operated at pressures up to 100 Torr, typical operating pressures range from 15 to 35 Torr. Oscillator efficiencies at these typical pressures and with flow velocities up to 60 m/sec range from 12 to 18% with fundamental mode efficiencies generally exceeding 10%."
"The concept and operational charcteristics of a compact regenerative ring CO2laser power amplifier for frequency-stable operation are presented. Regenerative amplifier operation is explored in two distinct regions: (1) the region of unconditional stability where the amplifier gain is below oscillation threshold and (2) the region of conditional stability where self-oscillation can occur. Experimental techniques and results for output power levels up to 50 watts are presented. It is shown that saturation effects play a dominant role in the phase characteristics, the output power, and the bandwidth of the regenerative ring amplifiers. Measured amplifier static and dynamic bandwidth characteristics are compared with those derived from the laser and cavity parameters. The influence of these parameters on the amplifier frequency-locking characteristics are discussed."
"A compact electrically pulsed HF laser is described. In this laser a mixture of SF6and H2in a 20-cm-long by 4-mm inside diameter Pyrex tube is subjected to 0.06 joule, 25 kV pulses at repetition rates up to 500 pps. The resulting fluorine atoms react with hydrogen to form vibrationally excited hydrogen fluoride. The output consists of the P(1)--P(7) rotational lines of the 1-0 vibrational transition and the P(2)--P(9) lines of the 2--1 transition. Line selection is provided by using a plane 300 line/mm grating as one reflector; the other reflector is an uncoated Irtran 4 flat. Average power on all lines is 20 milliwatts. Peak pulse power on dominant lines is approximately 10 watts. Average and pulse power are stable to within 2 per cent. The laser provides a convenient and compact source of infrared radiation in the 2.5-3.0 µm region."
"Using a fast-flow mixing device, CW lasing has been realized with HF, DF, and CO. A dc glow discharge was used to provide atomic species (F or O) that were mixed with a second reactant (H2, D2, or CS2) introduced through a spray tube just upstream of an optical cavity that was aligned transverse to the gas flow. Compared with previously reported CW chemical lasers that employ glow discharges with gas flow co-axial to the optical cavity, the present mixing laser produces higher power (watts versus mw.), and permits oscillations on (1-0) vibrational transitions in HF by virtue of the fast removal of ground-state molecules."
"A color TV camera system using a single pickup tube is described, together with the new vidicon developed for it. Color separation is accomplished by a pair of fine-striped color filters in effective optical contact with the vidicon target. The stripe widths and the angles the stripes make with respect to the scan direction are such that the red and blue images are modulated onto different carrier frequencies, the phases of which change 180° between successive scan lines. Signals from two successive lines are added, subtracted, and matrixed to give three primary-color signals, with better resolution than is obtained from other one-tube color cameras."
"A Filter Integrated Color vidicon (FIC vidicon) has been developed for single-pickup-tube simultaneous-color television cameras. The structure is identical to that of conventional 1-inch separate mesh, magnetically deflected and focused vidicons except for the optical structure and properties of the glass faceplate, which is composed of: (a) two kinds of filter stripes, red-reflecting and blue-reflecting; (b) a spatial-frequency-limiting quartz plate; and (c) an In2O3transparent electrode."
"The design to be described is based on an electrostatically focused gun, which, in contrast to the one used in the miniature Plumbicon tube, contains an accelerating lens. As a consequence the triode part, which contains a limiting aperture, can be biased at a low voltage, thus leading to a reduction in beam discharge lag. Such a gun could be placed in a normal straight pickup tube envelope, but it may also be combined with an enlarged head carrying the target, such that the outer diameter of the head is equal to that of the deflection coils. In this way the useful scan diagonal of the target can be made equal to the inner diameter of the envelope of the gun. A version with such an enlarged head has been realized in the research laboratory."
"A thermal-imaging camera tube is described that works at normal ambient temperatures in a modified 1 inch vidicon camera. A thin slice of triglycine sulfate (TGS) is used to convert a thermal image into a spatial distribution of stored charge. The modes of signal generation, by either cathode-potential or anode-potential readout, are explained. The measured responsivities of tubes with TGS targets agree with predictions from published physical properties of the material."
"A technique has been developed for probing monolithic devices before they are diced and scribed at frequencies in excess of 2 GHz. Small- or large-signal device parameters can be measured and enough measurements made on the wafer to obtain statistical information regarding the circuit or device. The advantages of the system are accuracy, speed, repeatability, and traceability. Within minutes after the wafer processing is complete you can know if the units are good or not and also how good."
"A silicon monolithic circuit consisting of reduced isolation capacitance and improved resistor design, and utilizing a new structure for dip open emitters is described. In this arrangement, the transistors are formed in a high-resistivity epitaxial layer, which reduces the parasitic isolation capacitance by more than a factor of two. The resistors are n-type rather than the conventional p-type. It is difficult to make p-type resistors in thin exitaxial layers because they tend to short to the substrate. Even using a subcollector-type layer between the p-type substrate and the expitaxial layer creates both a resistor-control problem and degradation of the high-frequency characteristics of the p-type diffused resistors. The high sheet resistivity of the epitaxial layer permits the formation of n-type resistors with excellent high-frequency performance. Typically, for identical resistor values the previous p-type resistors dropped to 90% of their value at 80 MHz whereas these n-type resistors dropped to 90% of their value at 2.5 GHz."
"A monolithic compatible process has evolved from a development of an LSI parallel correlator for the Naval Electronic System Command. This circuit includes over 12,000 devices operating in both a digital and an analog mode. Digital propogation delays of less than 10 µsec and analog inaccuracies of less than 5% over the -55°C to +125°C range established the device processing guidelines."
"A new field-aided lateral p-n-p transistor structure has been developed for integrated circuits that has performance characteristics (hfeand fT) that significantly exceed those of the conventional lateral p-n-p. Two basic mechanisms improve performance: drift-aided base transport and localized emitter injection. Both result from a lateral electric field that is set up within the n-type epitaxial base region by applying a biasing voltage between two n+contacts in this high-resistivity epi layer. These contacts straddle the single stripe p-emitter and p-collector regions so as to establish a lateral voltage drop under the emitter. The polarity and magnitude of this voltage gradient will debias the bottom and remote emitter edges causing emission to occur only as the emitter edge closest to the adjacent collector stripe. The effective base width is thereby reduced and, in addition, the p-type minority carriers are accelerated through the base width by drift action of this field. These field-aiding effects theoretically increase both hfeand fTby an order of magnitude, and this has been verified experimentally."
"A technique is described that makes possible the fabrication of p-channel MOS transistors and bipolar transistors within monolithic integrated circuits. Total process compatibility has been achieved without compromising either the n-p-n bipolar or p-channel MOS characteristics, p-channel MOS transistors withV_{T} = 1.7volts, gm= 1000 µmhos, andBV_{DS} = 35volts forW/L= 60 and tox= 1000 Å have been fabricated with bipolar transistors havingB = 100, f_{t} = 500MHz andBV_{CEO} = 50V."
"Polycrystalline silicon regions in the epitaxial layer of integrated circuits can perform isolation and buried-layer contact, and form surface elements such as field plates, capacitors, crossunders, and electrostatic shields. Recent experimental developments include new methods of selective growth and doping of these polycrystalline regions to provide very high voltage breakdown, low parasitic capacitance, and smooth surfaces with excellent pattern definition."
"One of the most important electrical parameters in evaluating the performance of MOS transistors is the effective mobility of minoprity carriers in the inversion layer of the device. Published results have examined the dependence of the effective mobility on substrate orientation and doping, Si-SiO2interface state density, gate electric field, and temperature. All of the above work has been performed on bulk silicon having a high degree of crystal perfection."
"In order to determine the operating limits of charge-coupled devices, a model that approximates the charge-coupled device with a traveling sine wave potential has been analyzed for operating power and losses attributable to surface states. The model has been applied to a 16-bit, four phase, CCD shift register with an active area of 0.0015 mm2per bit, and it gives the following predictions: Surface state losses with a 10-MHz clock will amount to approximately 1.1%/bit (atN_{ss} = 10^{11}/cm2eV) when an input signal level of 10-12coulomb is used in an n-channel device. Higher or lower signals, or a p-channel structure will lead to higher losses. Under the same conditions, the real driving power can be no less than 7 µwatts/active bit, and reactive driving power, expressed as reactive volt-amperes, is 26 µwatts/empty bit and 230 µwatts for a charged bit. The applicability of these results to the realizable device will be shown."
"The paper describes a technique for automatically aligning the gate contact of a Schottky-barrier gate field-effect transistor between previously fabricated source and drain contacts with submicron precision. The technique has been applied to both silicon and gallium arsenide but is not limited to these materials."
"One-µm n-channel silicon MOSFET's have been fabricated using ion-implantation techniques. The gate structures are self-aligned, with negligible overlapping capacitance. Because of low-temperature aspects of the ion-implantation and post-implantation annealing processes, they can be incorporated at any stage of the conventional silicon technology. The devices exhibit characteristics consistent with the inversion layer electron velocity saturation model. The transconductance in the saturation region is independent of the gate voltage and the channel length. For"
"Recently it has been shown that GaAs FET's with a Schottky-barrier gate are very promising devices for microwave applications. Transistors with a maximum frequency of oscillation of 30 GHz have been reported. The noise behavior of such devices has been investigated theoretically and experimentally. Compared to silicon devices, an additional noise source has to be taken into account in the GaAs FET--the intervalley scattering noise. This kind of noise occurs if carriers are scattered from the central valley to a satellite valley where the mobility is considerably reduced. This noise is very similar to the well-known generation-recombination noise."
"In order to advantageously exploit surface-charge transport of the type recently reported in practical devices, We have utlized a multilevel overlapping molybdenum metallization system. Specific structures will be presented that offer significant improvements in both speed and density over conventional MOSFET's and practical limits will be discussed. These new structures and the processing that produces them are compatible with self-registered MOSFET transistors, so that logic and amplification functions as well as charge-transfer devices are available on the same chip. The mathematical theory of the motion for surface charge is derived and discussed. A key result is that, although the transport equation is a diffusion equation, the effective diffusion constant is several hundred times larger than the thermal diffusivity of the minority carriers. A solution of this equation for shift-register-type device structures and the results of some simple experiments verifying the solution will be presented, and implications for speed and efficiency of charge transfer will be discussed."
"The silicon p-channel MOSFET has previously been characterized as a piezoresistive element. Since gmof the device varies with applied stress through modulation of surface-carrier mobility, it becomes of interest to examine the response of the device to acoustic surface waves induced in the silicon. The MOSFET has a geometry well suited for surface-wave detection since current flow is limited to the inversion layer and, in addition, the device can be fabricated with inversion layer dimensions less than λ/2 for surface waves of frequency less than 100 MHz. The devices can therefore be used to evaluate surface-wave propagation in any direction on a given silicon plane. The investigation also has practical aspects in that surface-wave detector arrays can find application as weighted tapped delay lines with weighting controlled by the application of various dc gate voltages."
"A new kind of three-terminal amplifying device that works on the principle of nonlinear acoustic wave amplification is described. The device has an advantage of simple transistor-like operation while maintaining the long delay times of an acoustic wave amplifier. A piezoelectric semiconductor with three ohmic contacts forms the basic unit; transducers are not required. An applied voltage to the \"emitter\" contacts results in the generation of acoustoelectric flux which is then injected into the \"collector\" region. The collector current is controlled by the injected flux, through the acoustoelectric effect. Large current gains can be obtained by adjusting the dimensions and resistivities of the emitter and collector regions. The time delay between input and output signals is determined by the sound velocity and device dimensions. It is possible to separate the emitter and collector by a centimeter or more, thus making possible microseconds of delay. There is gain at frequencies from dc to an upper cutoff fcwhich depends on the electromechanical coupling constant k2and the small-signal frequency of maximum acoustic gain\\omega_{m} = (\\omega_{c}\\omega_{d})^{1/2}. When there is strong acoustoelectric interaction (large K2) fccan be in the microwave region. A theory of device operation is described along with analytical expressions for the dc and r-f gain, and cutoff frequency, Experimental results are given for a test device made of epitaxial GaAs and operated at 77°K. Since GaAs has a small coupling constant, fcwas only 3 MHz; however a net current gain of 10 was obtained, and all key points of the analytical model were confirmed. In theory, room-temperature microwave performance can be obtained with strong acoustic materials such as ZnO or CdS, or with combinations of materials such as LiNbO3and Si. More experimental work must be done before we can say whether or not this type of acoustoelectric amplifier will be a practical high-frequency device."
"A unique material combination of a non-piezoelectric semiconductor adjacent to an insulating piezoelectric can create the equivalent of a piezoelectric semiconductor and hence give rise to an equivalent acousto-electric effect. The acoustoelectric interaction occurs when fringing electric fields, created by an acoustic surface wave on the piezoelectric, interact with carriers near the surface of the semiconductor creating a traveling space-charge wave. Under certain conditions an imposed drift field can cause the space charge waves to grow and lead to amplification. Practical amplifying devices have resulted from this unique effect and material combination, and are receiving increased attention in solid-state research groups."
"Acoustic surface-wave amplifiers have been constructed for operation from 100 to 1000 MHz using ion-implanted n-type silicon positioned over LiNbO3with an air gap of a few hundred angstroms. These amplifiers are being utilized in large time-bandwidth product tapped delay lines operating in L-band to compensate for propagation loss and isolate successive taps, thereby increasing the dynamic range."
"It is shown that a very precise wavelength standard can be developed based on the use of an He3-Ne20laser that is stabilized on an inverted Lamb dip associated with a hyperfine component of the B3II+ou← X1Σ+ogelectronic transition in I2129vapor. Extensive work has shown that when I2129is used instead of I2127, many of the inverted Lamb dips are sufficiently prominent to serve as steady and accurate frequency markers for stabilizing the laser. Lasers so stabilized have proven to have a stability and resettability (accuracy) of at least 1 part in 1011. This represents considerable improvement over the present 0.606-µm Kr86wavelength standard. Thirty-eight inverted Lamb dips corresponding to the hyperfine structure of I2129have been observed with the 6328-Å He3-Ne20laser over a spectral range of 650 MHz, demonstrating that this spectroscopic technique has sufficient resolution to resolve very small splittings."
"Pulsed laser action in neutral xenon has been obtained using a transversely excited helium-xenon discharge with xenon partial pressure in the range 5-50 Torr. The optimum xenon partial pressure is 100 to 1000 times greater than that in previously reported CW xenon lasers. Pulses of 1000 watts peak power and 0.5 microsecond duration are obtained, with spectral components at 2.027, 3.508, and 3.652 µm."
"The design and performance of stable, sealed-off, single-frequency CO2lasers developed at Lincoln Laboratory were last discussed at the June 1967 CLEA Meeting and in the June 1968 issue of the IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics. Since then, there have been many modifications and additions to the design with the aim of improving performance, versatility, and ease of assembly. An entirely new modular, internal mirror cavity frame was designed into which a choice of mirror holders, piezo-electric tuners, diffraction gratings, polarization selecting grids, choppers, and finally absorption cavities can be incorporated without greatly affecting short-term stability performance. Short-term stabilities of at least a few parts in 1013can be achieved for observation times of 0.1 second."
"Extreme care has been used to build stable He-Ne gas lasers of an integral design that includes the mirrors and the gas discharge tube in a single structure. Cornings ULE and 99JJW ultra low thermal expansion materials are used for the main components and ultra high vacuum type materials are used throughout. Beat-frequency measurements between two lasers were performed under pressure- and temperature-controlled conditions yielding a beat-frequency spectral width of the order of kHz over a measuring interval of 30 seconds. This result was achieved under ordinary laboratory conditions without any elaborate sound and vibration isolation."
"The parameters of greatest importance in a laser to be used for communications purposes in a space environment are weight, overall efficiency, ruggedness, and lifetime. We have developed a detailed design that tends to optimize these parameters for a 1-watt, conduction-cooled CO2laser. The laser tube utilizes a metal-ceramic structure for mechanical strength with a coaxial gas ballast reservoir. The electrodes are also designed coaxially for maximum electrical efficiency. Beryllium oxide was chosen as the ceramic material for enhanced heat removal by conduction to a metal heat sink. The warmest spot in the bore (other than the cathode) is only 4°C above the heat sink temperature under maximum power input conditions. The tube uses a 4-mm-diameter bore and has an active length of 16 cm. The ends of the tube are sealed with two gallium arsenide Brewster windows using metal soldering techniques. The mirror cavity is hemi-confocal and utilizes a 7% transmission output mirror (near optimum)."
"It is known that useful modulation of CO2laser radiation can be achieved using the Stark effect in molecular gases; however, no report of the frequency- and voltage-response characteristics of modulators using this effect has been available. This paper reports the results of an extensive experimental and theoretical study of such devices. Theoretical evidence that the frequency response of modulation depth is divided by the homogeneous absorption line width (∼ 50 MHz) into a nondispersive low-frequency region and a dispersive high-frequency region is presented. Additionally it is shown that the change in modulation depth with Stark field amplitude is divided into a linear low-field region and a non-linear high-field region. Experimental results demonstrating nondispersive linear modulation at frequencies to 30 MHz are reported."
"Absorption of 10.6-µm pump radiation by photo-induced carriers has been found to seriously degrade the performance of tellurium as a frequency doubler for the CO2laser. The effect limits the peak SHG efficiency to 15% and the average efficiency to 5% under the conditions of this experiment."
"The frequency translation of far-infrared radiation to the visible or near visible spectrum region by parametric upconversion in a nonlinear crystal has attracted considerable interest. This technique permits infrared detection by a photomultiplier or a silicon photodiode at or near room temperature with a sensitivity comparable to other direct infrared-detection systems."
"The most severe and fundamental performance limitation of the PPM focused TWT has been excessive thermal heating of the r-f propagating structure due to some fractional interception of the electron beam. The quality of beam focusing has largely been determined by the characteristics of permanent magnets in the Alnico series. With the introduction of the cobalt rare-earth alloys, a breakthrough in the performance of PPM focused TWT's can be expected."
"High-power helix tubes employing velocity resynchronization techniques have been developed that demonstrate efficiencies of 40-50 percent over an octave bandwidth with peak efficiencies in the excess of 60 percent. Shield-loading techniques were used to reduce the phase velocity dispersion generally experienced at low values of the propagation parameter γaand to extend the operating bandwidth to the low γaregion. The interaction impedance is high in this region and the velocity resynchronization schemes are particularly effective because of favorable beam-circuit wave interaction."
"Traveling-wave tube efficiency is generally limited by the beam-bunching process. Premature saturation occurs when a substantial number of relatively energetic electrons slip out of the decelerating phase of the r-f wave. A phase-focusing technique has been developed whereby electron bunches are preconditioned at low signal levels. A delay in the r-f wave is introduced in order to promote formation of the beam bunch in a relatively low decelerating field. At a higher signal level the tight beam bunch is introduced into the maximum decelerating field with the result that many electrons simultaneously yield a substantial percentage of their kinetic energy to the r-f wave. Simulations using one-dimensional large-signal analysis show interaction efficiencies up to 50% with a relatively compact velocity distribution in the spent beam. Computer simulated results will be displayed and experimental results discussed."
"A helix-type traveling-wave tube has been developed that provides 100 watts CW in the frequency range of 12.4 to 18 GHz. The paper presents the design approach used for the tube, choice of electrical parameters, construction details, and measured performance. During the development program we found that r-f performance and CW operation of the tube were critically dependent on helix materials. Problems encountered and their solutions will be described."
"The design and performance characteristics of a coupled-cavity traveling-wave tube are described. This tube provides power output of greater than 10 kW over an instantaneous bandwidth from 4.4 to 5.0 GHz with up to 57 percent overall efficiency, including solenoid and cooling power. High efficiency is obtained by use of the voltage-jump technique, wherein the beam voltage is increased in the output section of the slow-wave structure, in conjunction with circuit phase velocity tapering and two-stage collector depression. The tube uses a novel, self-contained vapor-phase cooling system that includes an air-cooled heat exchanger. This system eliminates the need for coolant pumps and provides excellent heat transfer and high cooling efficiency."
"The CW power level of reliable PPM helix-type traveling-wave tubes with over an octave bandwidth has been limited in the past to about 300 watts. A PPM focused TWT that has produced 500 watts of CW power over one octave in the S/C frequency band has been developed during the past year. This paper presents the design approach used, the construction details, and the measured performance. The tube is focused with a PPM array using Alnico 8 magnets. It employs a tungsten-tape helix structure to obtain operation over an octave. Some experimentation was done with radial focusing PPM structures. Results will be discussed. The design of the TWT is aimed specifically at a rugged construction for use in airborne equipment."
"As an ideal resistive sea for the silicon diode array camera tube target, GaAs films about 1000 Å thick have been investigated. The films were fabricated on the targets by a single-source evaporation technique. The tubes were vacuum processed as an elevated bake temperature of 400°C, which assures much longer cathode life. The tube performance has been measured to be much superior to the diode array target using an Sb2S3film and compatible to tubes using conducting top hats. In general, good beam acceptance results in considerable improvements in signal-handling capability, lag, resolution, and aging characteristics. Fortunately, good beam landing, even at low target voltages, is characteristic of the GaAs film; this results partly from the poor secondary emission ratio of GaAs films. The excellent tube performance achieved, in addition to the good beam landing, originates in the inherent nature of GaAs, which allows high leakage through the film even though the film sheet resistivity is high. Preliminary tests have shown two orders of magnitude better aging results than those of Sb2S3films three times thicker."
"Two-dimensional InAs charge-storage photodiode arrays for electron-beam vidicon applications are being developed. The InAs array diodes exhibit sufficiently low reverse leakage currents for the diodes to be operated in a charge-storage mode with an electron beam scanning at the conventional TV scanning rate of 1/30 second at a diode temperature of 77°K. The measured typical reverse leakage current density at near-liquid-nitrogen temperature is in the range of 5 × 10-10A/cm2at the reverse bias of 5.5 volts, with minimum background radiation on the diode. For the low-bias region, a study of the reverse current as a function of temperature indicates that the current transport mechanism is thermal in nature, and that it is dominated by the generation current in the space-charge region of the junction."
"Image sensors employing the charge-transfer principles of the bucket-brigade delay line for internal scanning offer potential advantages over the usual x-y addressed sensors in simplicity of fabrication. A design for a self-scanned bucket-brigade sensor that can be fabricated upon a monolithic silicon wafer with a single diffusion and one layer of metallization is proposed. An experimental array has been built comprising 15 rows of 32 series-connected MOS transistors whose sources and drains serve as photodiodes. These transistors are interconnected to adjacent horizontal buses so that each row can function independently as a shift register. In operation, each register remains inactive for a period of time during which an image charge pattern is built up on the photodiodes. The application of the horizontal clock pulses to that row causes the charge pattern to be transferred stepwise to the edge of the array where it is converted into a video signal. Although in the test sample the gating of the horizontal clock pulses to successive rows was accomplished by means of an external vertical scan generator, this could be replaced by an integrated vertical register formed on the same chip with the sensor."
"An all-electronic means is described for transferring the electronic charge pattern formed by an optical image incident on a silicon vidicon to the oxide surface surrounding the photodiodes. The stored image may be read out for several minutes or stored for longer periods of time. The resolution of the stored image is that of the silicon vidicon, while the dynamic range is that of the equivalent silicon dioxide storage tube. Neither an optical nor an electrical shutter is required during the cycle of operation."
"A new kind of resistive sea for silicon diode arrays has been developed. It is an electronically conducting glass that can be r-f sputtered reproducibly to give the desired combination of resistance and thickness. Since the resistivity can be varied over a wide range (103to 1014ohm-cm) the thickness can be chosen independently of the sheet resistivity. Furthermore, the material can be baked at a temperature of 300°C without degrading tube performance. Data on the processing and performance of the material will be presented."
"This paper describes the results of an investigation into the feasibility of MOS transistors of 1-µm channel length, for integrated logic circuits. It is estimated that their use Would improve packing density by up to a factor of 25 over that achieved by current technology. An additional advantage would be increased operating speed. Assuming that the overlap capacitances of the device are correspondingly reduced, a speed improvement of up to 10 times is estimated."
"To achieve high-speed and low-power logic, MOS integrated circuits with submicron effective channel length have been constructed. In the diffusion self-aligned structure, the effective channel is determined by the length of impurity side-diffusion. The same diffusion is effectively utilized to make an enhancement-mode MOST for the amplifier and to leave the load MOST in depletion mode. This enhancement-depletion composition has the merits of low supply voltage (down to 1.5 V) and high speed. Furthermore, in this configuration the noise margin to NFBis insensitive to variation of the gate-oxide thickness and has a wide allowance for the surface concentration of the diffused base layer."
"The major advantages offered by silicon-gate CMOS technology have been applied to the fabrication of monolithic integrated circuits for micropower applications. Complementary n- and p-channel enhancement-mode devices fabricated with silicon gate in conjunction with a unique substrate preparation tech, nique have exhibited threshold voltages of 0.5 ± 0.2V. Drain-to-source leakage currents, as well as pot to substrate leakage current, are typically less than 1 nA at 3 V."
"An MOS study has demonstrated the feasibility of fabricating reliable low-threshold-voltage n-channel enhancement-mode sealed-junction beam-lead IGFET's. By use of 10 ohm-cm p-type substrates and a gate dielectric of SiO2-Al2O3, stable 1-2 volt n-channel enhancement-mode IGFET's can be fabricated if a high-work-function metal, such as platinum, tungsten, or molybdenum is used for the gate metallization. Platinum was chosen for initial stady because of its existing state of application in beam-lead technology. Characterization and analysis of MOS capacitors on 10 ohm-cm p-type substrates with an SiO2-Al2O3dielectric and platinum field plates will be described."
"Microstrip circulators using all-ferrite substrates (ε = 15) become excessively large at lower microwave frequencies (≤ 3 GHz). Typically, at 1.8 GHz, the circulator will have a diameter of 2½ inches. Therefore, they are incompatible with other microwave integrated circuits. This paper describes the development of a dielectrically loaded circulator operating in the above-resonant mode that reduces the size of an 1.8 GHz three-port circulator to 1 × 1 × 3/4 inch without any degradation in performance characteristics. Substrate (NPO Material) with a dielectric constant of 31 was used, with a ferrite puck imbedded in the center of the substrate forming a composite substrate. Both sides of the composite substrate are metallized with chrome-seeded copper. The etched microstrip circuit consists of a resonant disk in the center over the ferrite puck and three λ/4 impedance transformers that transform the impedances of the resonator to 50 ohms at the output of the three ports. Circulation results when two permanent magnets, properly spaced and mechanically supported by rexolite spacers, are placed on both sides of the composite substrate. The electrical performance of the circulator is summarized as follows: fo= 1.8 GHz Isolation 50 dB (max) 30 dB over 3.5% BW 20 dB over 15% BW Insertion Loss 0.25 dB min. ≤ 0.4 dB over 14% BW VSWR ≤ 1.3:1 over 29% BW. Detailed description of the design procedure, fabrication process, tuning and measurement techniques will be presented."
"Anodized, sputtered hafnium (hafnium dioxide) produces a high-dielectric-constant (∼40) capacitor that has low electric loss. Measurements to 10,5 GHz on capacitors in the range 6 to 96 pF show good performance as dc blocks and bypass capacitors in actual use. Series resistance at 3 GHz is below 0.3 Ω series inductance is of the order of 50 pHy. Temperature effects, processing techniques, and measurements are described. These capacitors are compatible with standard microwave-integrated-circuit processing techniques used to make both lumped and distributed circuits. The results described were obtained on chip versions of these capacitors."
"P-N and M-S epitaxial GaAs varactors have been developed for broad-band parametric amplifiers. At, zero bias the varactors have a junction capacitance of 0.15 pF, and a cutoff frequency of 700 GHz when measured at 70 GHz. Millimeter wave measurements indicate a series inductance of 0.08 nH and a shunt capacitance of 0.025 pF, These unusually low values for the parasitic elements have made it possible to achieve beyond the state-of-art broad-band and low-noise amplification."
"A high-purity n-type indium antimonide sample mounted in a re-entrant cavity and cooled to 4.2°K was operated as a millimeter- and submillimeter-wave detector using a down-conversion process. Power applied at the millimeter-wave frequency causes a change in the material's conductivity which in turn causes a change in the X-band power absorption, and cavity perturbation techniques were used to analyze the scheme. The detector was operated successfully at frequencies of 35, 60, 80, and 150 GHz with no long-wavelength cutoff frequency observed. A minimum terminal-to-terminal conversion loss and NEP of 11.5 dB and 6.8 × 10-11W per unit bandwidth, respectively, were measured. The response time is limited by the carrier relaxation time which is of the order of 10-7s."
"The operation of p+-n-n+silicon avalanche diodes with conversion efficiencies as high as 50 percent in the 0.9 to 1.7 GHz range is shown to be completely consistent with a trapped-plasma-mode explanation. Detailed sampling oscilloscope measurements of external current anddV/dtwaveforms have strongly substantiated Evans' analysis for the interaction between standard coaxial cavities and trapped-plasma-mode oscillators, and provided direct confirmation of the principal features of the trapped-plasma mode. The experimentaldV/dtwaveforms indicated the presence of peak displacement currents prior to breakdown, that were on the order of 1.5 times the critical current (q N_{d}v_{s}), required to launch a traveling avalanche zone. Approximately determined conduction-current waveforms exhibited larger currents during the shock front transit than during the extraction period. The terminal voltage during the extraction period was found to be near zero. The 4-GHz upper bound frequency and 1-GHz optimum frequency for the fundamental trapped-plasma mode were found to be consistent with the analytical calculations made by Cottam for diodes with doping and width similar to those studied and for waveforms similar to those observed."
"Efficient TRAPATT oscillators have been demonstrated with p+-p-n-n+mesa diodes. The starting transients have been studied in a simple circuit with only a single discontinuity in a 50-ohm line. A rapidly rising bias pulse has been used to start the oscillations and current and voltage waveforms have been measured with a time resolution of about 50 picoseconds. The results show that in a low-Q circuit steady oscillation is established in less than one cycle and no initial IMPATT oscillation is required. With this circuit less than optimum efficiency is obtained. With higher-Q circuits several periods are required to establish equilibrium, but higher efficiencies are obtained. Even in this case no IMPATT oscillation is seen. These results are obtained at a frequency that can be mechanically tuned from about 0.4-2 GHz."
"The build-up processes of harmonically related modes from a silicon avalanche diode and the behavior of the simultaneous presence of these modes have been observed. We conclude that the lowest frequency mode (which had been regarded as the subharmonic mode) is the fundamental mode rather than the subharmonic mode. The output powers of these modes are related to each other because of feedback through the parametric effects or pumping by the second harmonic. Various superimposed mechanisms have been investigated, and the build-up processes are demonstrated in an animation film. A very stable oscillator has been obtained at 43 GHz with a diode that avalanched at a relatively low voltage of 12 volts."
"The fabrication and characteristics of high-power close-confinement GaAs laser diodes are described. Single-pellet devices emitting up to 100 watts peak power at 300°K and multiple-pellet units emitting up to 250 watts peak power are detailed. All diodes were fabricated from GaAlAs-GaAs, heterostructure wafers that were prepared by liquid phase epitaxy. The parameters considered in the design of these devices are discussed in detail and the test equipment and measurement techniques used in their characterization are outlined. Test results showing lasing threshold current density, peak optical power output, conversion efficiency, and emitted beam patterns for these devices are presented. Reliability data relating to long-term operational life and mechanical and environmental testing is also presented. A comparison is made of the gradual degradation of units operated at a current density of 50,000 A/cm2with units operated at reduced (30,000 A/cm2) drive currents."
"Recently we prepared double heterostructure (DH) injection lasers that were the first junction lasers to operate continuously at and above 300°K. The lasers are multilayer structures of AlxGa1-xAs and GaAs that have the wider-gap material on both sides of a thin layer of the narrower-gap material and that, for CW room-temperature operation, were bonded onto diamond heat sinks. At 300°K the best DH Fabry-Perot lasers have lower threshold current densities(J th \\approx 1600-3000A/cm2) than the best single heterostructure (SH) lasers (∼ 8000 A/cm2) or the best homostructure lasers (\\sim 20-30kA/cm2). This results from improvement in optical and carrier confinement, and, in fact, passive guiding has been observed in active regions of the DH laser."
"Fabry-Perot diode lasers with room-temperature threshold current densities in the 1500-3000 A/cm2range are described. Among the properties discussed are power and quantum efficiency, spectral characteristics, variation of threshold current density with temperature and structural factors, and reliability. Comparisons were made with available laser theory. Data concerning both catastrophic and gradual degradation will be presented. Comparative performance data will be presented for diode lasers fabricated using various heterojunction configurations. By suitable modifications of the laser fabrication process it is possible to tailor the devices for specific applications such as high peak power and high brightness or high average power but low peak power. The lowest threshold current density devices are found to be suitable mostly for the latter application because of their low threshold for catastrophic damage."
"Low-threshold double-heterostructure junction lasers have recently been operated continuously at room temperature. In this paper, we describe several properties of the stripe geometry double-heterostructure laser configuration. Because of the superior thermal properties of the stripe geometry, room-temperature continuous operation is achieved even when current thresholds are nearly an order of magnitude larger than those reported in Ref. (1). Continuous operation up to 355°K has been obtained. Under pulsed conditions, these lasers have been operated as high as 500°K with less than an order of magnitude increase in threshold over the room-temperature value."
"The parameters necessary to specify surface damage to nonlinear crystals are described and the power densities descriptive of the damage process are defined. The definition of the occurrences of surface damage is discussed and preliminary experimental results given for LiNbO3, Ba2NaNb5O15and several other materials irradiated by a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. These results obtained using TEM00and \"multimode\" lasers are analyzed and used to provide the basis for planning future experiments."
"Ultrashort (6 psec) green light pulses have been photographed in flight by an ultrahigh-speed camera with a framing time of 10 psec. The green laser pulses are made visible from the side by passing them through a colloidal suspension of milk particles in water, which linearly scatters a small fraction of the light. The green pulses are photographed from a direction normal to the beam by a camera positioned behind a shutter with a 10-psec framing time. The shutter is an ultrafast Kerr cell driven by infrared laser pulses 8 psec in duration. The ultrafast camera is sufficiently fast to \"stop\" the green pulses but not enough to resolve their detailed shape. As compared to the two-photon fluorescence technique for the display of picosecond light pulses, this new ultrahigh-speed photographing technique is much more sensitive and of much easier interpretation."
"Investigations and experiments in cavity dumping of various gas and crystalline lasers have been carried out. The system in either case is composed of a folded cavity laser and an intracavity, Brewster-cut, fused silica, acousto-optic modulator."
"Klystrons have been developed to drive resonant linear-accelerator cavities at duty factors from 6 to 12%. A fast-acting control system is required to modulate the r-f drive power to the klystron such that the electric field established in the accelerator load is held constant during the pulse to ± 1% in spite of the 30-40% changes in power demand. The klystron must therefore run unsaturated and have a reasonably well-behaved gain curve, but must also operate near saturation under peak demand for good efficiency. Further, because the accelerator load impedance varies drastically during the pulse, the klystron must demonstrate controllable characteristics over a wide range of load impedances."
"Continuing development of peramanent-magnet-focused high-power klystrons has resulted in achievement of efficiencies in excess of 50% with microperveances greater than 2 at a frequency of 2856 MHz. This paper will discuss the latest advances made in the study of klystrons operating with highly relativistic beams."
"The objectives of this program were the design and development of a high-efficiency, 1 megawatt, air-cooled, tunable pulsed klystron. The design was based on extensive use of a number of computer programs for all portions of the tube. Recent theoretical large-signal klystron work indicates state-of-the-art in efficiency at microperveance-2 operation could be extended by optimizing the beam behavior, the intercavity drift lengths, the cavity tunings, and the output coupling. Efficiency improvement results from the removal of electrons from the interbunch region and the optimization of their phase relationship at the outFut gap. The computer-predicted results indicated a conversion efficiency of 60% using the chosen beam and cavity parameters."
"The effects of a finite or spatially varying focusing field, drift length, and cavity voltage and phase have been studied with a disk-model digital-computer program. The gaps are assumed to be thin and gridless and Mihran's merit figure is used to calculate the output power of the klystron. The pertinent equations, assumptions, and the methods of calculating the space-charge forces are discussed. The resulting large-signal program is sufficiently flexible so that a multicavity klystron with a piecewise linear focusing field may be analyzed in a single run."
"To date, conventional depressed collectors have yielded only moderate improvements in the overall efficiency of microwave tubes. Their basic deficiency was a premature onset of reflected primary and secondary electrons, which backstreamed into the tube at modest levels of depression. The approach pursued here involves a sphere combined with a central cone and a short spike protruding from the cone as a flexible geometry to effectively perform three functions at the same time; (to velocity sort the electrons, to show the electrons to a minimum realizable velocity at collection, and to prevent the back-steaming of secondary and reflected primary electrons into the interaction region of the tube). The experimental setup permitted the measurement of primary and secondary electrons arriving or leaving each collector electrode."
"A ten-stage electrostatic depressed collector has been designed and tested on a one-kilowatt CW klystron. The collector design is based on an extensive study of electron trajectories, utilizing an alalog computer. The computer program includes both the effect of space charge and the effect of the residual magnetic field in the collector."
"If a collector in a beam-type tube (a TWT for example) captures all the electrons in the spent beam an almost zero velocity, tube efficiency can be greatly improved. Such a collector might be called a \"soft-landing\" or \"depressed\" collector. This paper describes the principle, design theory, preliminary experiment, and application of a new type of collector, the TEF (Tilted Electric Field) collector, in which an almost complete soft-landing condition can be realized. In this scheme, several apertured collector plates are tilted with respect to the tube axis so as, to form a tilted decelerating electric field. An axial magnetic field is also applied. In such a structure, the electrons in a multivelocity spent beam are decelerated, velocity-sorted, and collected. The source of the velocity sorting action is the transverse drift motion of electrons provided by the combined action of the axial magnetic field and the transverse component of the electric field."
"Cathodochromic dark-trace tubes using KCl as the screen material have been built for at least three decades. Recently developed cathodochromic sodalite materials give improved storage-display tube performance over the standard KCl tubes. The induced cathodochromic coloration in both socalite and KCl is the result of F-center absorption. A limitation of KCl is that after repeated and prolonged exposure color-center aggregation occurs. Unlike KCl, however, in sodalite each F center is located in an aluminosilicate cage. These cages shield the F centers from each other, and therefore color-center aggregation does not occur. Furthermore, in the optically reversible coloration region the cathodochromic sensitivity is higher and the contrast range is larger in sodalite than in KCl. A more intense image can be obtained that is erasable thermally but not optically. The maximum contrast ratio attainable in this manner is also greater in sodalite than in KCl."
"An electron-beam membrane light modulator (EBMLM) for use in real-time holographic imaging has recently been constructed. This particular EBMLM is built as a barrier-grid storage tube. The target is the polymer membrane itself upon which Js deposited a 100 × 100 array of metallized islands. A charge pattern corresponding to the video holographic signal is written on the metallized islands. Corresponding electrostatic forces exerted upon the islands cause the membrane to deflect locally, thus spatially phase-modulating coherent light reflecting from the opposite side. Because of the low capacitance of each island (0.01 pF, typically) and their small size (10-40 µm) it should be possible to perform real-time holographic imaging with arrays consisting of 1 million elements at full video bandwidths. Design trade-offs are discussed."
"The in-line arrangement of three electron beams allows much easier convergence than the delta arrangement. However, in a color picture tube with three in-line beams and the conventional shadow mask, the transmission of the shadow mask must be made very low in the corner region to aviod the overlapping of adjacent in-line triplets of beam spots. This overlapping is due to interference between the geometrical tilt pattern of the directions of the in-line triplets landing on a spherical phosphor screen and the rectilinear alignment of apertures of the conventional shadow mask used. The paper presents an improved design of the geometrical aperture alignment, through which the overlappings are prevented throughout the whole screen area, allowing high transmission of the shadow mask with resulting brightness improvement."
"In the beam-index color-television tube, a single electron beam is scanned horizontally across a structure of vertical red, green, and blue phosphor lines in a conventional raster. Color reproduction is obtained by sequential application of the red, green, and blue color signals to the beam, taking care that the instantaneous color signal corresponds to the color of the phosphor strip being hit by the electron beam. The correct time sequence of this process is controlled by a signal, generated by the index tube, indicating the instantaneous position of the electron beam."
"A unique new electron-beam line scanner has been developed that has many advantages over both a conventional CRT flying-spot scanner and a laser line scanner. The extraordinarily simple construction consists of a thermal emission cathode, a pair of flat rectangular glass substrates containing thin-film patterns, and a target such as a phosphor. The substrates, assembled parallel to each other with a small gap, act, under digital input signals, to control a sheet beam of input electrons. All segments of the input beam except the desired one(s) are absorbed into the surface, and the remaining one(s) constitute the output signal beam. Inherent advantages of the line scanner over CRT scanners include digital addressing, high-resolution operation, multiple-beam and pseudo-random scanning, geometric invariance, very compact size, stability, ruggedness, no moving parts, high-speed, low-voltage switching, long life, and low cost. The principle of operation and the development status will be discussed."
"Low-threshold-voltage, radiation-resistant complementary metal-nitride-oxide-semiconductor (CMNOS) arrays have been constructed utilizing a multilayer nitrid-oxide gate insulator. Both the n- and p-channel CMNOS devices havre threshold voltages that are typically 0.5 to 0.9 V. This low threshold permits operation of the arrays with a 5-volt power supply providing very low power dissipation and low insulator electric fields."
"A \"normally off\" silicon Schottky-barrier FET (SBFET) has been realized. The normal off characteristic was obtained by controlling the thickness of the reacted PtSi layer under the gate so that the depletion layer of the PtSi-Si Schottky-barrier contact might extend over the n-channel layer (n = 1.0 × 1016/cm3, t = 0.30 µm) and just reach the high resistivity (~ 3 kilohm-cm) p-type substrate. The threshold voltage was controlled in the range, 0 < Vth < 0.1 volt."
"MOS ion-implanted integrated circuits such as 10-MHz shift registers and 100-ns read-only memories are now being fabricated using boron as the implanted species. The sheet resistivity of boron-implanted layers, given a certain dose and energy, is determined by the anneal temperature cycle, which must be compatible with the metallization process used. Typically, at 545°C (compatible with an aluminum metallization process) about 10% of the implanted boron ions are electrically active, giving, for a dose of 1014/cm2at an energy of 80 keV, a sheet resistivity of about 2.5 kilohms/ square. However, if before or after the boron implantation one implants inert ions such as neon, one can observe drastically different sheet resistivities for the same anneal temperatures. This is probably caused by the introduction of supplementary damage by the second implant. If the neon dose is low (\\sim 10^{12}-10^{14}/cm2), The sheet resistivity will be increased. If it is high (\\sim 10^{16}/cm2), an amorphous layer is created that can lower the sheet resistivity as was previously observed by other workers. The possible applications of these effects on ion-implanted integrated-circuit technology will be discussed as well as similar observations made by pre- or post-bombardment with other inert ions such as argon or silicon."
"The ability to use junction field effect transistors in integrated circuits simplifies circuit design. This paper describes the techniques used in fabricating p-channel junction field effect transistors (J-FET) in an integrated circuit, using ion implantation and standard IC processing. This circuit contains resistors, transistors and three J-FETs on the same chip. The J-FETs are used as constant current sources and have a pinch-off voltage of less than 2 volts and an IDSSof ∼ 1 ma. The J-FETs are formed by ion implanting 5 × 1012/cm2B+at 100 keV, using SiO2as a mask to define the p-region which eventually becomes the channel region. The n-type gate is formed at the same time as the emitters of the transistors. The resultant circuits are characterized by a uniform J-FET pinch-off voltage and IDSS, reflecting the control associated with ion implantation."
"The Ge-ZnSe heterojunction has been prepared by vacuum evaporation of the ZnSe onto single-crystal p-type germanium substrates. The growth conditions have been studied in terms of epitaxial growth on different crystallographic orientations in degrees of vacuum down to the ultra-high-vacuum region. Measurements have also been made of the electrical characteristics, capacitance properties, and photoelectric response of the diode. From these measurements a realistic band model has emerged involving intrinsic and extrinsic defects present in the bulk and interfacial region of the zinc selenide. The results of this investigation are compared with those from devices grown by vapour phase epitaxy and the data presented suggests that a Mott-type barrier rather than a Schottky barrier is present at the germanium-zinc-selenide interface. Techniques have been developed for the removal of this Mott barrier and the resulting change in the physical properties and band structure will be given. Possible applications of heterojunctions with this particular band structure will be discussed."
"Schottky-barrier diodes of chromium on n-type epitaxial gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) were studied from 25° to 440°C. The diodes showed significant rectification properties up to a temperature of 440°C. At high temperature the reverse leakage current was 1.15 milliamperes at 25 volts with a diode area of 1.14 × 10-3cm2as compared with 0.25 microampere at room temperature."
"New and improved schemes for making ohmic contact to epitaxially grown GaAs have been developed and will be presented in this paper. They have been successfully applied to microwave Schottky-barrier FET's and Gunn diodes. These contacts were prepared by dc sputtering of thin Au-Ge and Au-Zn films on n- and p-type GaAs, respectively. By controlling the Ge concentration in the film, the usual balling up can be avoided and more uniform wetting obtained. Carrier concentration under the contacts was profiled by a new junction capacitance technique, and no high-resistance layer was detected under these contacts. Contact resistances of these contacts as well as ones fabricated by other techniques have been measured over a wide range of carrier concentration (1 × 1015< n < 5 × 1018/cm3; 3 × 1016< p < 2 × 1019/cm3). They range from 10-4to 10-6ohm-cm2, depending on the carrier concentration of the material. These data can be explained by a simple model in which the surface concentration of GaAs is increased by the doping effects of Ge and Zn. The surface alloyed region of these contacts was extensively investigated and characterized by scanning electron microscopy, backscattering and channeling experiments, and electrical measurements. They indicate that Au penetrates exponentially into the bulk, and a disordered layer is introduced at the surface. These can be reduced if the alloying temperature and time are kept at a minimum."
"Many workers have discussed the possibility of improving the voltage capabilities of so-called planar diodes by the use of a metallic overlay that counteracts the effects of surface charge and the finite radius of junction edge curvature. This paper extends these results by detailing design considerations essential in achieving reliable, low-leakage, high-yield diodes having breakdowns in excess of 1500 V."
"In order to maximize the dynamic characteristics such as frequency rating, turn-on time, and rate of rise of current rating in a thyristor, it is necessary to maximize the conductivity modulated are (plasma) at any given time. Interdigitation of the cathode and gate is a method by which the plasma can be spread more rapidly to the whole of the emitter area."
"Various characteristics of semiconductor devices are determined by the behavior of the injected carrier. Thus, it is desirable to measure the spatial distribution of the injected carrier density and its time variation. This paper describes a new microwave technique for the measurement of conductivity in a small portion of a semiconductor. The new technique uses a special antenna by which microwaves are radiated onto a small surface area and the reflected microwaves from this surface are received. The new technique has the advantage that excess carrier density and current density at a small area (0.01 ∼ 0.1 mm2) in semiconductor devices can be determined."
"A large-amplitude, subnanosecond-rise-time, pulse-generating GaAs diode has been developed. The diode has a ν-n structure; the ν-region was made by diffusing iron into n-GaAs. The iron in the diffused layer was detected by mass-spectrometer analysis; the depth of the diffused layer was of the order of 10 µm. Electrical contacts were formed by gold-germanium or indium alloying techniques. Compensation of carriers by diffusion of iron must be controlled precisely to produce pulse generation. The pulse generation could not be observed when the diffused layer converted to p-type."
"Calculations are presented to show that the primary limitation on the room-temperature quantum efficiency of the red luminescence in zinc-and oxygen-doped GaP is due to nonradiative Auger recombination of electrons and excitons trapped at Zn-O nearest-neighbor complexes. Significant improvements in the low-level quantum efficiency can be achieved (up to values of 100%) through reduction of the free-hole concentration by intentional compensation of highly zinc-doped material, the latter being necessary to provide a large concentration of Zn-O recombination centers. Because the recombination time of the trapped carriers increases inversely with hole concentration, large low-level quantum efficiencies are found to be incompatible with fast speed of response and with maximum brightness. This happens because at low hole concentrations the long recombination time leads to a rapid saturation of the Zn-O complexes simultaneously with a lengthened radiative lifetime. Detailed model calculations are presented characterizing the best state-of-the-art material (7% efficiency) as well as the theoretical optimum. The 7% LPE diodes are best characterized by 1017/cm3Zn-O pairs and a minority-carrier lifetime of 2 ns, corresponding to a maximum brightness of 15 lm/ cm2at a current density of 10 A/cm2. A reduction in background impurity concentration by a factor of 2 is predicted to raise the brightness by 25%. In order to achieve the theoretical maximum brightness of 27 lm/cm2at 10 A/cm2an order of magnitude reduction in residual impurities is required. For current densities of the order of 1 A/cm2, a factor of 3 improvement in brightness is predicted over the presently attainable value of 2 lm/cm2."
"Beam-leaded GaP electroluminescent diodes have been developed using a quasi-planar configuration. This new structure couples the advantages of beam-lead technology to the high-efficiency GaP p-n junctions prepared by liquid-phase epitaxial growth. These devices represent a significant improvement in the design of GaP diodes for applications involving discrete elements or integrated arrays."
"New GaAs and Ga1-xAlxAs electroluminescent (\"LANER\") diodes have been developed that exhibit light-activated negative resistance. Room-temperature switching operation is possible. In the case of the GaAs device, the p-n-p-n structure was fabricated by liquid epitaxy, using Si as an amphoteric dopant. This multilayer structure was prepared in one growth process by varying the cooling rate, typically from 0.5° C/rain to 14° C/min. The p-n-p-n structure was examined by measuring both photovoltaic effects and the I-V characteristics. Breakdown can be triggered by light or by increasing voltage, similar to the behavior of an SCR. The turnover voltage Vt, in this diode is typically 15 V at room temperature. Vtdecreases with decreasing temperature and with increasing irradiation intensity. The current flowing through the diode is less than 0.1 mA below Vt. In the high-conductivity state, radiation with a peak at 9400 Å is emitted, with an external efficiency of about 5%. Switching times of 0.25 µs are attained at higher applied voltage."
"GaAs(Zn) electroluminescent diodes using a GaAs-GaxAl1-xAs heterostructure design with external quantum efficiencies (300°K) of 10%, that 40 milliwatts of continuous output at a current of 1 ampere, have been developed. The heterostructure consists of a GaxAl1-xAs(Zn) p-layer grown by liquid-phase epitaxy on an n-type GaAs(Si) substrate (n = 1-4 \\times 10^{18}/cm3) with the simultaneous diffusion of Zn a distance of ∼ 2 µm into the substrate."
"The plasma display panel, in its usual mode, retains information in the form of wall charges that determine whether or not a sequence of discharges will be maintained at a given cell. These discharges are stable in the sense that a perturbation in wall voltage at a particular discharge will damp out over the succeeding discharges. Recent work has shown that a cell in a plasma display panel can exist in one of several states, each with a unique set of wall voltages and each with a unique average intensity. As with the bistable case, each state is stable in the sense that perturbations damp out. Three states have been achieved simultaneously, with brightnesses that can be characterized as bright, medium, and dim. Within the constraints of a simple theoretical model, the conditions for stability can be stated in terms of the products of the slopes of charge-transfer curves. This technique for achieving variable intensity retains the advantage, inherent in the plasma display technique, that the information, once imparted to the display, is retained as long as the sustaining signal is applied to the entire panel."

  "The history of traffic signals is traced from the signal fires which guided early man to the sophisticated electromechanical signal devices of today. Early experiments with officer-operated semaphores, lanterns, and electric lights are discussed. The influence of railroad signaling is noted, as are the innovative efforts of inventors who saw the problems of congestion and hazard developing to the point where control measures were essential. Descriptions of several devices show the imagination of early practitioners, and one may reflect with some humor on what might have been developed for use today. Some of the earliest attempts at automatic control even made use of the policeman's whistle, blown by a small compressor, while later efforts included clanging bells as a substitute. The extent to which some of these quite primitive devices survived in actual use into the post-World War II era is remarkable; devices unique to an area often hung on, long beyond the time when they were made obsolete by newer devices. Credit is given to several pioneers in the field, along with appropriate references to the few who have contributed to preservation of parts of the history of this interesting subject."
"The Highway Research Board (HRB) was established in 1920 as a unit of the Division of Engineering, National Research Council, under the corporate authority of the National Academy of Sciences. Its purpose then, as now, was fourfold: 1) to stimulate highway research 2) to correlate highway research 3) to make known the findings of highway research 4) to undertake, when appropriate, special highway research projects. The interest of the HRB in electronics goes back many years. Many of its committees have been concerned with the use of computers, photogrammetry, instrumentation, traffic surveillance and control, and similar uses. Test instrumentation and data reduction techniques, developed at the HRB's large field tests of highway pavements in the 1950s, were highly sophisticated at the time. The services of the HRB include the Highway Research Information Service (HRIS), which became operational in 1967 and represents one of the most complete compilations of information on highway-related research available in the United States. The scope of the information stored in the system is as broad as the problems of planning, building, maintaining, and operating transportation systems. Subjects range from parking regulation to soil stabilization, from aggregates to aesthetics, from hydrology to psychology, anything having to do with highway travel or its interaction with other modes of transportation. The science of information transfer is progressing very rapidly. The HRB will keep abreast of new developments in technology; therefore, HRIS, the Maritime Research Information Service (MRIS), and the Transportation Research Information Service (TRIS) necessarily will be under a continuing state of review and will be modified from time to time to keep up with new developments as soon as they are proven effective."
"Three different electromagnetic loop vehicle detector designs are described: self-tuning, bridge balance, and phase-shift. Principles of operation, design limitations, and design trade-offs for each method are presented in detail. The characteristics of the lead-in wire used are shown to be the primary limitation in loop detector performance and stability. Characteristics of commercially available wire used in present-day loop detector installations are discussed. Design equations and graphs illustrate the tradeoff considerations in the determination of optimum loop configuration and inductance."
"Three different physical phenomena are discussed as applied to the detection of roadway vehicular traffic. These detectors are the input data sources for vehicle-actuated traffic signal light control mechanisms, control systems, freeway surveillance, and statistical analysis. Radar detectors using microwave radio frequencies in the 2.5-10 MHz are discussed with regard to operating principles, design consideration, and practical application. Similarly, acoustical detectors operating in the 20-kHz range and low-flux density change magnetic detectors are discussed. A comparative analysis is made of radar, acoustical, and magnetic detectors, as well as mechanical, magnetic, induction, and optical detectors."
"This paper presents some of the economic and technical considerations for development of future noncooperative vehicle-detector systems. Vehicle-detector accuracy requirements, installation cost, location, and the roadway environment are used to develop a set of preferred vehicle detector characteristics. In addition, a description of vehicle detectors, considered for development by the Bureau of Public Roads, and some of the current vehicle-detector concepts under development, are presented."
"The problem of providing the communication link for modern highway management and control is analyzed. A 100- mile span of highway is analyzed for typical voice and control function requirements plus closed circuit television monitoring capability. Based on this analysis, the number of channels and hence the bandwidth required to meet typical requirements is developed. It is proposed that a coaxial cable system can best provide the bandwidth and access flexibility that will be necessary for the many links required for effective highway management. A coaxial cable system as a transmission path is shown to be two dimensional in that it involves absolute signal levels as well as spectrum considerations. An analysis of distortion characteristics of state of the art coaxial cable systems is included to arrive at signal to noise plus distortion ratios versus cable length and amplifier gains. Typical cable costs, burial and tunneling labor costs are discussed to show economic practicality. Finally, two high-capacity cable systems are discussed to illustrate the communications capacity of coaxial cable systems."
"Problems are discussed that are presented by shortage of available radio channels if conventional space-wave propagation modes are to be utilized on any extensive basis in establishing new communication and control facilities on interstate highways to enhance safety and efficiency of operation. The need for an integrated-system approach to attain maximum efficiency in the use of the radio spectrum, and adaptability to orderly expansion by compatible stages in accommodating future functions such as those involved in the automatic-highway concept are emphasized. A review of proposed highway communication, surveillance, and control functions, indicates future requirement for a very substantial bandwidth in the radio-frequency spectrum, as well as the need for localization and directionalization of signaling fields to minimize interference difficulties. Use of coaxial-cable systems, with roadside transmission facilities positioned below ground level, is proposed in lieu of microwave or other radio-relay techniques for a number of point-to-point communication and control functions of value to the public and to highway departments. The technical aspects of these roadway services, as well as factors relating to utilization of induction-radio transmission methods as a means of restricting effective signaling range substantially within the right-of-way for vehicular communication functions are discussed. Field strength and other measurement data as derived from experimental tests of roadside-cable systems at various carrier frequencies are incorporated."
"As part of the future improvement of the nation's highways, the Bureau of Public Roads is planning a two-way communications system. This system will incorporate various sensors to provide for better control and also many safety and convenience services which would be desirable for more efficient use of the highways. A unique radio system confined to highway right-of-way which is economical and has the inherent growth capability which would be required for a nationwide system is outlined. The design concept makes use of recently developed F1-F1repeater techniques which would result in a nationwide system requiring only two radio frequencies, one from the headquarters' control to the cars or trucks and one from the car to the headquarters. The highly stable roadside frequency is transmitted from the local headquarters' control point and confined to the highways on an F1-F1repeater system. The car equipment is a transponder unit whose frequency is controlled by the highway system. Automatic location identification of the car signal is provided. Signals can be either voice or digital. For growth and integration with other special services such as car or truck identification, traffic control, route guidance, etc., time-sharing channels can be added to both the highway system and to those cars that require it."
"The nature and magnitude of the demand for emergency communications generated by users of rural freeways is described. A classification diagram of potential communications systems is presented and a preliminary selection of candidate systems is made on the basis of overall technical and economic considerations. The operating efficiency of the selected systems is analyzed in terms of their estimated detection efficiency and detection time performance. This analysis when combined with system cost projections demonstrates that a one-mile interval terminal design providing two-way voice communication between the motorist and an aid dispatch center provides the best benefit-cost ratio consistent with a satisfactory level of service. The operational characteristics of the selected system are described in some detail."
"The flash lights and send help (FLASH) system uses an electro-optical detector designed to enable passing drivers to conveniently summon assistance for motorists in distress. The driver signals at designated reporting stations by flashing his high-beam lights three times. A roadside unit detects the headlight flashes and transmits an identifying tone signal to a central monitoring station, whose operator dispatches a service vehicle to the section of road under that detector's jurisdiction. The detector performs reliably over a range of 1000 feet during daylight or darkness, bridging an illumination ratio of up to 1:10 000 000 without a mechanical iris. The concept, design, and mechanical construction of the system is discussed in relation to the technical fulfillment of practical operational requirements. These include day and night operation, variations in temperature and weather conditions, random reflections, public safety, pranksters, vandalism, and repair and maintenance. A detector knockdown alarm, system test mode, and an audio alarm are incorporated on an illuminated road-status display panel located at the central monitoring station. A prototype system is presently being installed on a 50-mile (80-km) section of Interstate 4 between Tampa and Orlando in Florida, and will be operated by the Florida highway patrol during a 1-year evaluation period."
"Some streets in the heart of Washington, D. C., are to become a test site for trying new traffic-control strategies. Surveillance (detection of vehicle presence and estimation of traffic conditions from this information) is an important function of this test site. Traffic parameters compatible with existing surveillance equipment and suitable for traffic control and evaluation have been selected, and their characteristics analyzed. These parameters are volume, occupancy, and queue length. Of these, only queue length uses estimation of individual vehicle motion and therefore is characterized by the greatest uncertainty. Its potential usefulness, however, is great enough to warrant considerable analytical and experimental effort. Equipment required for the surveillance task includes the vehicle detectors, communications, and digital computer. Selection of the detector is influenced by local ordinances, as well as the system requirements; the result was the choice of an inductive loop detector. For the selection of the communications several techniques were compared, and a modified tone-multiplexing approach was chosen. The computer requirements for surveillance include handling high detector input rates, performing high-speed computation and bit manipulation, and providing disk and tape storage for the surveillance-derived data."
"The use of digital computers in traffic is becoming more common, after years of experimentation and promise. Both the theoretical requirements of such systems and a description of the physical and programming characteristics of systems in operation in several locations in the United States will be dealt with. The improvements in traffic flow and the managerial, manpower, and organizational requirements will be discussed. Finally, the probable short-range and long-range direction of new systems will be hypothesized."
"A computer-directed traffic-control system is described which is being designed under the sponsorship of the Bureau of Public Roads. The system is intended to increase the efficiency and safety of the merging maneuver by detecting and tracking gaps in the merging lane of the freeway and by dynamically controlling ramp vehicles into these gaps. This system is also concerned with optimizing throughput in the freeway corridor by distributing traffic demand between the freeway facility and supporting network of arterial streets. The description of this system is supported by a treatment of the parametric relationships governing traffic control on freeway, and reference to the historical development of merging control systems."
"A description of an operational vehicular tunnel traffic-flow control system is presented. Using photoconductive cells as vehicle detectors in the Lincoln Tunnel South Tube and a fixed logic hardware controller to activate traffic signals and signs at the tunnel entrance, traffic is metered in a manner which results in less congestion. The vehicle detectors use wall-mounted high-intensity light sources aimed at a cell which is located below a hole in the tunnel roadway. The cell is hard-wire connected to the logic controller. The controller, using discrete solid-state components, determines the number of vehicles between two points in a tunnel lane; in addition the controller calculates the speed of each vehicle at both points. Using these parameters, the controller decides if the entering traffic-flow rate should be lowered. If a decrease in the rate is warranted, amber traffic signals and a sign which states \"pause here-then go\" is then energized. When the threat of possible congestion is alleviated, the entrance controls are automatically de-energized by the controller. A comprehensive traffic-flow control and stoppage-detection system now being implemented is also discussed. This system will employ four small-scale digital computers working in pairs at both the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels. Basic raw data will come from both induction-loop vehicle detectors and photocell vehicle detectors arranged in alternating pairs at seven points in each of the ten traffic lanes comprising the two facilities. Output will consist of control signals to entrance traffic devices, as well as alarms designed to draw the attention of facility personnel to one of nine or more television monitors per tube showing the area of a detected stoppage."
"Many agencies, both governmental and private, in the highway transportation field need a system which would automatically identify motor vehicles. The basic concept of such a system requires a vehicle-mounted coded device, a transponder, that uniquely identifies that vehicle. As this vehicle comes within the range of a system interrogator installed along or on the highway, the code is read by this interrogator and the identification of the vehicle is obtained. The ideal transponder is passive and requires no power; has no effect on, and is not affected by the vehicle; does not require physical contact with the interrogator, and requires no action by the vehicle operator. Sensing at a distance (noncontact) involves the detection of some type of energy; either radiated or reflected from the object being monitored. Many different sensing techniques, including magnetic, infrared, optical, sonic, radioactive, radio frequency (RF) transmission, microwaves, have been surveyed, investigated, and analyzed to determine their applicability for an automatic vehicle identification (AVI) system. This analysis has concluded that a low-frequency induction system is presently the most appropriate method for use on the highway environment, Several diverse systems differing in design details have been constructed and tested, utilizing this basic technique. This paper describes the design of these systems as well as the methods that have been proposed and/or developed using the other sensing technologies."
"Various land mobile communities are actively seeking new tools which will offer significant improvements in the efficiency with which they manage the operations of their mobile fleets. The various types of location and information reporting techniques which can be used to supplement existing voice-radio communications to achieve this goal are described. Both fixed- and random-route location systems will be considered in terms of system characteristics as these relate to the needs of specific user groups such as law enforcement agencies and transportation organizations. The location techniques considered will include electronic signposts, trilateration (direct measurement using both wide-band (pulse) and narrow-band (phase) modulation), and automatic navigation systems. System parameters to be discussed will include: spectrum efficiency, Federal Communications Commission licensing considerations, required and achievable location accuracies, data-system speeds and reliability, and elements of cost effectiveness analysis. Finally, requirements for other types of vehicular information which are needed to produce a practical total system will be explored."
"The electronic route-guidance system (ERGS) is the result of an effort by the Office of Research and Development, Bureau of Public Roads, to develop a new concept for guiding the motorist. To implement the concept, a system has been developed which makes use of electronic equipment both in the participating vehicles, and at intersections which are to supply guidance instructions. The system is destination oriented. The driver enters a code word, representing his intended destination, into the vehicle equipment. Then as the vehicle approaches each instrumented intersection, the destination code is transmitted to the roadside where it is decoded, according to a stored program, and a routing instruction is transmitted back to the vehicle. In the vehicle, the routing instruction is displayed to the driver in the form of a symbol or word message, which gives the maneuver the driver should make at the upcoming intersection or interchange to reach his destination optimally. The development of the system from its conception to its future application and benefits are discussed. The descriptions of today's highway routing problems in the \"static\" and \"dynamic\" situations are presented, then the outline of the Bureau of Public Road's developmental effort and the major contributions of its various contractors is discussed; Philco-Ford's development of a destination coding system and techniques for solving optimal routings, General Motors Corporation's development of an installed and operating engineering model, Serendipity's determination of driver-information requirements for ERGS, and Kollsman Instrument Corporation's development of an automobile head-up display for the ERGS routing symbols. A separate section gives a description of the General Motors system design at the functional and component level. Future development and system benefits are discussed. Dynamic system requirements over and above the present or static ERGS are envisioned, including both additional hardware and software. Benefits to the highway system and to the highway user are given for the static or preprogrammed system and for the dynamic system. A highway transportation subsystem which could be implemented in the near future, and which retains the driver as an integral part of the system, but is expected to enhance the driver's performance by unburdening his route guidance task and allowing more attention to the primary task of controlling the vehicle, is presented. Furthermore, the addition of central control facilities and communications links to intersections is expected to permit more uniform distribution of traffic over the highway network."
"Highway automation is an attractive possible solution to some of the problems posed by an ever-increasing number of motor vehicles, as it would probably result in substantial increases in traffic-flow rates and a dramatic reduction in the numbers of highway accidents and fatalities. One practical system involves a roadway complex of the future, consisting of both automated and nonautomated roads, which will have evolved in an orderly and progressive manner from the roadway system of today. Only the main highways would be automated, and dual-mode vehicles would be used. The two major related technical areas in this framework are the physical characteristics of the various required subsystems for vehicle guidance and control and the optimum operation of the overall highway system. The elements of the former are divided into eleven categories: automatic longitudinal control, vehicle-spacing detection, communication systems, automatic lateral control, automatic merging control, controlled lane changing, vehicle propulsion, system decision-making capability, compatible manual mode, automatic vehicle checkout, and evolutionary developments. The role and state of the art of each category are discussed in detail, together with the complex interrelationships which exist among categories. Although some research has been accomplished, substantial future research and development progress will be necessary before an automated highway system is a practical reality."
"The motoring public is increasingly conscious of the fact that the U. S. street and highway systems is rapidly becoming choked with vehicles. In many instances the answer to this problem does not lie in pouring more concrete. Instead it is necessary to first, ensure the proper balance between the various modes of transportation, air, water, road, guided or tracked vehicles, and in some cases the substitution of communications for personal travel; second, research and development (R&D) projects, both short and long term, must be intelligently implemented if the best use is to be made of highway resources: roadway, vehicle, and driver. More efficient highway systems of the future will, of necessity, require an increasing use of electronics. Both equipment and systems must be considered in implementing R&D projects. If only equipment R&D is undertaken, the overall improvement will be piecemeal. On the other hand, better systems cannot be created without improved technology. Four aspects of the highway system are considered: advisory, control, surveillance, and areal information and control. Ingrained in them is the continual pressure to develop methods that are designed to bring about better understanding of traffic-system needs. Implementation of future electronic systems, therefore, depends on an orderly transition to future systems, by utilizing all available R&D resources. Highway electronic systems must be adapted to the potential user, i.e., the man-machine interface, and the systems acceptability to the public. In all systems safety is the prime objective; and cost must be within an acceptable range."

"Parameters of a large-scale highly coordinated mobile telephone system are discussed, particularly those of system size and frequency spectrum required. The concept of small-zone coverage areas to serve large customer densities is discussed, and the essential properties of small-zone systems are generalized to show that zone size alone is not an adequate parameter to distinguish large- from small-zone systems. A high-capacity small-zone system model using several zone sizes is presented. Advantages of small-zone operation other than spectrum economy are enumerated, as are the attendant disadvantages."
"High accuracy is not required for car locator systems used in police operations. Relatively inaccurate patrol car locator devices can greatly improve police operations by significantly reducing response time, by permitting dynamic redeployment of forces, and by providing for better administrative control of forces. The patrol car emitter-call box sensor technique could also be used on passenger buses and taxicabs to summon police assistance. The technique involves equipping patrol cars, buses, or taxicabs with a short-range coded radio frequency (RF) emitter devices and equipping call boxes or other public electrical facilities with a device for sensing the emitter signal of the passing vehicles. Presence and identity of the vehicles can be detected and automatically telemetered over existing telephone or electrical lines to a computer-controlled display board in the dispatching center. Vehicle identification encoding is accomplished by modulating the emitter-transmitter with a selected combination of tones that differs for each vehicle. The system would use a transmitter-receiver combination similar to that used by automatic garage door openers. Vehicle identification encoding would be accomplished by using techniques similar to those of the touch-tone dialing system of the telephone company. By taking advantage of existing call box systems, the implementation of this system would be particularly feasible for cities, such as Washington, D. C., that have an extensive police call box system. How such a system could be installed in Washington, D. C. is described in detail. Features of the system are the following: 1) relatively low installation cost; 2) minimum spectrum space requirements; 3) accuracy of ±¼ mile achievable with existing call box locations in Washington, D. C.; 4) it is possible to selectively increase accuracy by area; 5) spectrum requirements remain constant with increased accuracy or increased geographical area of coverage; 6) simple inexpensive and proven equipment requirements."
"The IEEE Third Symposium on Vehicular Communications Systems was held on 13 May 1969, in Los Angeles, CA, USA, and treated the subject of electromagnetic spectrum utilization. This subject is very broad in scope and very timely in that the recent release of the JTAC report entitled \"Spectrum engineering - the key to progress\" should produce a long needed reevaluation of the approach to electromagnetic spectrum utilization. The content of the program is reviewed here either by the paper, an abstract, or comment by the Symposium Chairman."
"The following fundamental technical questions concerning the use of the spectrum allocated to the land mobile radio service are discussed. 1) Is it technically feasible to increase the number of assignable channels within the allocated spectrum space? 2) Are other modulation methods more or less suitable for providing more channels? The primary resource material used to answer these questions is the response of the Land Mobile Section, Industrial Electronic Division, Electronic Industries Association [49]. Only the frequency spacing question is treated in this paper."
"The dispersed array mobile radio system represents a radical new approach to the problem of spectrum congestion in the land-mobile radio service. This new approach provides a very substantial improvement in spectrum utilization over the present mode of operation and at a cost to the user of about 20 percent less. Spectrum efficiency is achieved by a dynamic combination of space, time, and frequency diversity. Cost reduction is achieved because the mobile radio unit is a compact low-power short-range all solid-state transceiver."
"The surface distribution of composite incidental man-made radio noise power in metropolitan areas displays frequency and range variations which are predictable from a knowledge of the propagation characteristics of irregular surface terrain for low-height antennas and the noise-source spectral power densities for a Poisson distributed random noise process. The observed frequency variation of composite surface noise power in the very-low-frequency (VLF) through the lower very-high-frequency (VHF) band is porportional to the product of 1) the inverse first power of frequency, introduced by irregular terrain basic path loss dispersion for low antennas, and 2) the inverse quadratic frequency dependence of the noise-source spectral density. In the upper portion of the VHF band and in the ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) range, the basic path loss dispersion remains unchanged while the emission spectrum of the surface noise sources asymptotically approaches that of band-limited white noise. The observed first-order surface range dependence for composite man-made noise within an urban area is predictable from the measured variation of irregular terrain basic path loss for low-height antennas and displays a somewhat smaller exponent than the free space propagation function. The general range function for composite metropolitan area man-made noise power displays a quadratic exponential variation with distance from the urban center. The level of man-made noise power, observed from 1 to 5 miles above metropolitan areas, can be related to the surface noise distribution, the radiation pattern of the receiving antenna, and the coordinates of the airborne detector, relative to the urban center. The noise level, the noise spectral density, and the position dependence of the airborne noise power are predictable from this information plus a recognition that, as the receiver field of view increases with altitude or beamwidth, the amplitude distribution of the surface sources approaches a unit normal distribution in conformity with the central limit theorem for multiple independent random sources. Tests of the validity of the theoretical predictions of the range and frequency dependence of both surface and airborne man-made incidental radio noise power in the VHF-UHF bands have been performed, using accumulations of both surface and airborne noise data obtained from measurements in and above urban areas in Europe, Asia, Australia, and North and South America. Theoretical and experimental comparisons have confirmed the validity of the noise generation and propagation models and support their use for calculating the deterministic characteristics of metropolitan area incidental man-made noise."
"Summary form only given. Frequency multiplexing techniques and theory with particular emphasis on its possible applicat,ions to the land mobile radio service are presented. Three forms of frequency multiplexing are analyzed: 1) frequency modulated subcarriers which are frequency modulated on a master carrier (FM/FM); 2) single sideband subcarriers which are frequency modulated on a carrier (FM/SSB); 3) single sideband subcarriers which are single sideband modulated on a carrier (SSB/SSB). "
"Summary form only given. Today's air-ground communication system normally reqnires the assignment of a discrete very-high frequency, and, where appropriate, an ultra-high frequency for every function associated with air traffic control. This requires that each function of a control tower, such as approach control, local control, ground control, etc., and each function of the air route traffic control centers (ARTCC), such as high- and lowwdtitude sectors, be assigned at least one discrete frequency and in many cases two or more. When a channel for a particular function becomes saturated or when new facilities or functions are added to the system, more channels are required. Recent FAA studies have indicated there is presently a reqnirement for more than 100 channels over and above the number now available. As aviation grows, the problem will become mote severe. Solutions available within the framework of today's system and current equipment will not produce acceptable long-term results. Therefore, it appears necessary to consider and evaluate new methods of air traffic control communication techniques. One methcd currently under consideration by the FAA is the discrete aircraft frequency concept. This concept differs from the present system in that a single frequency would be assigned to an aircraft. The ground system would semi-automatically change to the aircraft's frequency when communication is desired, as opposed to the aircraft changing frequency for every control boundary and function in today's system. One cf the advantages would be better frequency utilization, by balancing communication loading over all communication channels. In this system, assignment of the frequencies to aircraft would be done so that at any given time and place the total number of aircraft will generally be uniformly distributed among the available frequencies."
"The very large increase in the use of the radio spectrum has resulted in numerous cases of spectrum congestion, and the continuing growth in spectrum-using devices can only result in increasing instances of congestion. With the objective of gaining fuller and more detailed understanding of spectrum congestion than has previously been available, Stanford Research Institute has been making an intensive study of the general problem of adequately defining and evaluating the characteristics of radio spectrum usage. An important element of this study has been the acquisition of a significant data base on channel occupancy and message characteristics in a large block of spectrum. To obtain pertinent data, a scanning receiver monitoring system was designed and placed in operation in selected areas of congested spectrum."

"Automobile headlamp illumination is of concern because uniformity and shape of the beam pattern are quite important for optimum road visibility and safety for oncoming drivers. The Society of Automotive Engineers' specification on headlamp illumination [1] designates the maximum and minimum intensities at several spots within the beam. Many states require inspection of vehicle-mounted headlamps for illumination and aiming, and this test is commonly performed using a device which clamps on the headlamp lens. This clamp-on device is limited to checking the maximum intensity at beam center, rather than checking the overall beam pattern to the SAE-J579a specifications. In addition, mechanical limitations of this device have often resulted in the mis-aiming of vehicle headlamps. Present instrumentation available for measuring light intensity per SAE-J579a is primarily of the photo-cell type device, and the point-to-point measurement of light intensities is quite tedious and time consuming. A technique is described in this paper which incorporates electronic signal processing into a closed-circuit television system for displaying contours of constant illumination intensity. The technique is capable of rapidly performing vehicle-mounted headlamp testing per SAE-J579a and could be adapted for use at state inspection stations."
"The response toward the zenith of an untuned 16.5- foot vertical whip antenna mounted on the rear comer of a jeep, relative to the response of a half-wave horizontal dipole at 15 feet above ground, was measured at high frequency with an ionospheric sounder. At 4 MHz, the relative response of the whip was -52.5 dB, and it increased with frequency at a rate greater than 12 decibels per octave (i.e., greater than frequency to the fourth power). The absolute power gain of the whip at 4 MHz was estimated at about -37.5 dB, ±6 dB relative to an isotropic radiator, and the variation with frequency was approximately a fifth-power law [i.e., Gp≈ -70 + 55 log10(fMHz) dB] in the frequency range of 4 to 8 MHz. The short-path sky-wave signal received by the untuned whip can be enhanced by about ±10 dB, ±4 dB relative to that received with a vertical whip, by bending the whip away from the vehicle at an angle of 30° or more. When the same whip is bent forward and tied down over the hood of the vehicle, the received sky-wave signal is enhanced by only +3 dB, ±4 dB. These results should apply regardless of whether the vehicle is traveling in open or wooded terrain."

"The title \"New Challenges for Vehicular Technology mineering\" aptly describes the technical program of the Twentieth Annual Conference, which was held on December 4-5, 1969, in Columbus. OH, USA. The Conference Committee concluded that, while the IEEE Vehicular Technology Group had established strength in certain areas (e.g. mobile communications), the Twentieth Annual Conference presented an excellent opportunity to expand in several new and important directions. The resulting program, whicn is shown herein, thus represents an attempt by the Committee to stimulate interest in these new areas without diminishing interest and quality in our traditional areas of strength."
"A moving-base car-following simulator was designed and constructed for studying the driver-vehicle system under various simulated highway conditions. The simulator consists of four primary components-- a moving-base cockpit, a model lead car on a variable-speed treadmill on which a two-lane road is continuously positioned, a closed-circuit television system, and a laboratory analog computer--which are described in detail. The results obtained in car-following studies using this simulator closely approximated results from corresponding highway experiments; thus, the simulator can be used to obtain valid data pertaining to the driver-vehicle system in such studies. However, the simulator is characterized by several disadvantages that limit the range of its applications. These disadvantages are discussed, and various highway situations that can be effectively studied are described."
"An automatic electronic marine warning system for use under conditions of reduced visibility is described. The heart of the system is a rapid ringing bell for fog warning at anchor. A bell tone was recorded and analyzed, and simple electronic circuits were developed to produce a tone approximating this bell sound. Other circuits include a foghorn signal with electronic timing circuits for sounding either the foghorn or bell at intervals appropriate to the situation. Associated with this system is a loud hailer and listener, and provisions for monitoring the outputs of communications receivers or other audio circuits. The system operates from a 12-volt dc supply and is designed for use on small vessels where limited operating personnel are available."
"Energy density requirements and available flashlight cells suggest the use of lower voltages in power supplies for hand-carried portables. Optimum time utilization of rechargeable batteries requires high charging rates, yet portable radios tend to insulate the batteries thermally, making overcharge at normal rates undesirable. A dual-rate charger with voltage sensing alleviates the overcharge problem. For maximum time utilization, this concept can provide a 15-minute charge to 70 percent capacity. Description is provided of this high-rate charger, with suitable precautions for use in two-way radio environments."

Moreover, they should know how to communicate with the Commission on any matter of mutual importance. It is the intent of this paper, by way of a straightforward description of the Commission's structure and functions, to overcome the unfortunate lack of familiarity which seems to exist on this subject within our professional ranks. The relation of engineer to lawyer as well as engineer to engineer is also discussed. A cursory review of the non-technical offices completes and ties together this elementary course of \"What Every Engineer Should Know About the FCC.\""

 "In the last several years it has become commonplace for representatives of the computer industry and others to speak very convincingly of the enormous amount of data that will soon be transmitted via communication lines throughout the U.S., quoting such authoritative sources as AT&T itself for their information. So forceful have been these remarks that we have generally been lulled into believing them wholeheartedly, even to the point of listening almost without question to predictions of the complete breakdown of the telephone system, because of the amount of data that it will have to handle in the future."
"Computer networks have the ability to bring the power of large machines to work on a single problem and to provide reliable computer services to large populations. They also may become an unmanageable structure that can cripple itself in a fashion akin to the great Northeast power failure in 1965. Imagine the following sequence: computer X does not have the sine subprogram but relies on computer Y for it; computer Y on the other hand solves the sine subprogram using the cosine subprogram which it doesn't have; computer Y therefore calls X for a cosine; X solves for cosine using sine which it asks Y for.& Of course, you say, no computer network would be so simplistic. But would you guarantee it could never happen for any set of computer resources among N computers-and that the network might not head for the buried recursive disaster like a lemming for a cliff?"

"A modern data storage system is designed in three independent phases. The first design, that of the memory element and subsystem, has the objectives of providing functionally simple storage units of high capacity and operating speed at low cost. This discipline embraces the design of core, film, semiconductor and optical static memories as well as a variety of moving media memories."
"Technological improvements in memory systems in the '70s are expected to have a significant impact on computer organization. The expected advances will result in associative memories at reasonable cost, small-capacity random-access memories at low cost, and mass memories with greatly reduced access time. Possible implications or effects of each of these advances on the organization or design of future computer systems are identified."
"A thorough treatment of the trends in memory element and subsystem designs in the 1970's would require a very exhaustive presentation and be considerably beyond the scope of this article. It is hoped, however, that some of the information contained herein will be helpful to the reader."
"There has been a trend in applications programming over the past fifteen years from highly structured programs and loosely structured data toward loosely structured programs and highly structured data. Transaction oriented systems and other data directed programs make greater demands on the memory hierarchy of a computer system and have given rise to the need for storage media which are to some degree structurable under program control. Overhead in operating systems and large on-line application programs is described as a symptom of \"static\" and \"dynamic\" mismatch problems in the storage hierarchy. Some new memory organization techniques beginning to appear on computers may allow greater efficiency in data directed systems since they allow the programmer to store the structure and the content of his data separately."

"An asynchronous unit delay is an n-input n-output asynchronous sequential circuit such that the present value of the output n-tuple is equal to the value of the input n-tuple prior to the last input change. The delay is of significance as a building block for shift register realizations of asynchronous circuits."
"While any digital computer can be designed using the tools of sequential network theory, it becomes practically impossible to handle a state table description and the appropriate synthesis methods for even modestly sized systems. Therefore, the most common approach to logic design considers subunits of the computer as individual sequential networks, i.e., sequential machines. They are designed separately and assembled into the overall system. Proper partitioning and an adequate system description are very essential in such a design effort. Functional microprogramming can greatly facilitate these tasks."
"A descriptive notation is proposed for microprogramming which uses conventional sequential machine notation for the microprogram, and a register transfer language to define microoperations. The combination allows the definition of useful formal transformations which preserve system behavior. The transformations correspond to paralleling and disassembling microoperations in time and altering the control unit appropriately to preserve the original behavior."
"Many algorithms for grouping data without supervision depend on some criterion. We state two basic requirements such criteria should meet and we discuss several criteria in terms of these requirements. An attempt to satisfy both requirements simultaneously with a simple criterion leads us to introduce a linear transformation of the data. Although our principal result is for a two category problem, we present discussion and an example for the many category problem as well."
"This paper is a case study of a general method for designing generators of repeatable non-Poisson sequences of pseudorandom pulses. A class of normal distributions and some classes of skew distributions are derived. Block diagrams and design guides are given. The study is based both on analytical and simulation approaches. Applications of the proposed system may be found in the field of hardware simulation techniques and in more efficient arrangements of general purpose machines where they are used in simulation studies."
"Classical switching theory has long been held inadequate in the solution of the pragmatic problems that face the logic designer because it is too cumbersome. This is primarily due to the exponential proliferation of states. A theory of sequential switching networks was sought that would yield more convenient methods for the analysis, synthesis, and debugging of switching networks. The basis for such a theory would have to be a departure from the microscopic individual state orientation of classical switching theory towards a macroscopic theory dealing with states and transitions as aggregates."
"This paper considers the loop-free decomposition of nonautonomous, synchronous, deterministic, nonlinear sequential machines into linear and nonlinear component machines. Two methods are derived which generate the desired decomposition and determine the state code assignment consistent with the linear realization of a component machine. Both processes are well suited for implementation by a digital computer. One of the procedures for decomposition and code assignment is analytic (in that trial and error processes are not required) and it discovers the largest possible linear component machine. In this decomposition the linear component machine is the predecessor of the nonlinear component machine. The other method, which may require iteration in some cases, yields a decomposition in which the nonlinear machine is the predecessor of the linear machine."
"Many-valued switching systems have been of considerable academic interest, despite the apparent inability to use them in practical applications. The main drawbacks, as pointed out by a number of authors, are the difficulties associated with the implementation of the functional basic set and the lack of adequate simplification techniques."
"A new unit-distance counting code (similar to the Gray code but having error-checking properties) that offers distinct advantages in the simplicity of the digital equipment required for encoding and decoding is described. This code has application in several special areas of information processing. It is generated by a particular generalization of the family of Gray codes, which has no error- checking features, but shares with the Gray code a simple conversion relationship to the conventional binary counting code. The new code is derived, and its error-checking and code conversion properties are proven by simple combinatorial arguments. The code has a total of K(m)= 2.2m/2code words of m digits each (m any even integer). It may be employed for correction of single errors or for the detection of double errors."
"In the final form of the Hanson method for the synthesis of ternary threshold functions on r-basis, a weighting vector appears whose coordinates were calculated by a tabular procedure.

"The family of solutions for a Boolean equation is commonly represented in a single formula involving arbitrary Boolean parameters. It is well known that n parameters suffice to construct a general solution for an equation in n unknowns. For some equations, however, a general solution may be constructed using fewer than n parameters. This paper describes a method for constructing reduced solutions, i.e., general solutions involving the fewest parameters possible."

The second is concerned with that of finding a set of switching functions that can be implemented by a faulty tree circuit."
"This paper is yet another solution for finding linear internal state assignments for the next-state behavior of a sequential machine. A state assignment is said to be linear if and only if the resulting next-state variables are linear combinations of the present-state and input variables. Consequently, the next-state behavior of a sequential machine is said to be linear if and only if there exists a one-to-one assignment which is linear. The problem of finding linear assignments has received considerable attention, probably due to their inherent mathematical structure, and hopefully to further illuminate the theory of sequential machines in general."
 "The authors define a general repetitive machine (GRM) as a finite automaton in which the initial state can be reached from every final state. If there exists a tape which takes all final states to the initial state, the automaton is called a repetitive machine (RM). The RM's constitute a proper subclass of the GRM's. The first result is that a GRM is either strongly connected or it has a nonaccepting dead state, and the remaining states form a strongly connected subset."

"An algorithm that runs on a 2048-word LINC provides efficient on-line editing of character strings virtually unlimited in length. Fixed-address LINC tape holds the character sequence in the manner of a scroll. Edited characters are spliced directly in or out of the scroll as it moves across a display scope under the viewer's control. A 512-character \"playground\" created at the splice point provides sufficient ease to permit changing the scroll contents dynamically, and thereby simplifies several problems commonly associated with on-line editing. Compensatory inserting and deleting are practical. Inserted characters require no special identification and scroll maintenance is automatic. Editing commands for simple editorial functions and editorial text identifiers are eliminated, and the number of characters that can be inserted anywhere is limited only by the total length of the scroll. Line numbers, if provided, are resequenced automatically as the scroll contents change. As little as 2 percent of the scroll is manipulated in the memory at a time. Despite the relatively slow transfer characteristics of the tape, performance is satisfactory on a LINC for scrolls up to 23 040 characters and is not strongly dependent on the size of the playground."
"This paper describes a novel structure for a hardwired fast Fourier transform (FFT) signal processor that promises to permit digital spectrum analysis to achieve throughput rates consistent with extremely wide-band radars. The technique is based on the use of serial storage for data and intermediate results and multiple arithmetic units each of which carries out a sparse Fourier transform. Details of the system are described for data sample sizes that are binary multiples, but the technique is applicable to any composite number."
"An efficient partitioning scheme based on current capability of MOS MSI technology was evolved in which four functional building blocks were defined for implementing computer digital architecture. The partitioning employs a bit slice concept to define registers and a universal logic gate for general two-or three-variable logic. A look-ahead carry for fast arithmetic and a heavily buffered OR gate structure for the control section complete the partitioning elements. Microsequencing for instruction decoding is accomplished with a state graph implemented with register FBB flip-flops."
"This paper presents a derivation of a linear feedback function for an r-stage feedback shift register that results in branchless less cycles of equal length. The linear recurrence relationship and generating function, which characterize the r-stage feedback shift register's behavior, are used to prove that each of the 2r states lie in cycles of equal length."
"This paper delineates an application of two classes of parity-check codes to the design for failure-tolerant counters. They are 1) a modified first-order Reed-Muller code and 2) the perfect Hamming code. The first code employs a majority element for implementing the error-correcting scheme while the second one makes use of a variable 2j-2+1-out-of-2j-1+1 majority element. These coding techniques can be applied in principle to other logic hardware to increase its reliability."
"In this paper we present a method for obtaining a functional partitioning of the logic of a computer. It is shown that given a basic function to be performed, such as addition, the computer logic can be partitioned into four disjoint sets, namely the active information logic I, the semiactive flip-flops l, the activated control logic c, and the dormant logic D. Techniques involved in implementing the partitioning algorithm such as an event-directed simulator and three-value simulation are discussed. An application of this partitioning scheme as part of a large logic simulation system is described."
"The page-faulting rate is one of the important criteria measuring the performance of a virtual storage under demand paging. In a multiprogrammed and/or time-sharing environment, a job is not expected to be run from the beginning to the end without interruption. In effect, it is segmented into phases and run piecewise. When running in this \"segmented mode,\" a job phase upon initiation will most likely not possess the storage contents left by its preceding job phase (from the same job). Further, a job running in a paging environment at time t has a nonzero probability of referencing information brought to the high-speed store before t. Hence, for a given job, the segmented mode will yield a higher page faulting rate than the \"continuous mode\" in which the job runs continuously from the beginning to the end. By saving and retrieving its \"working ensemble\" upon the termination and initiation of a job phase, a job can be made to possess an \"apparent continuity\" insofar as the storage activity is concerned. The performance of the \"apparently continuous\" mode is hoped to approximate that of the continuous mode with an insignificant amount of overhead. Based on this observation, a storage organization oriented toward the minimization of overhead, is proposed. Simulation has been done for verification."
"This paper treats an aspect of the learning or estimation phase of statistical pattern recognition (and adaptive statistical decision making in general). Simple mathematical expressions are derived for the improvement in supervised learning provided by additional nonsupervised learning when the number of learning samples is large so that asymptotic approximations are appropriate. The paper consists largely of the examination of a specific example, but, as is briefly discussed, the same procedure can be applied to other parametric problems and generalization to nonparametric problems seems possible. The example treated has the additional interesting aspect that the data does not have structure that would enable the machine to learn in the nonsupervised mode alone; but the additional nonsupervised learning can provide substantial improvement over the results obtainable by supervised learning alone. A second purpose of the paper is to suggest that a new fruitful area of research is the analytical study of the possible benefits of combining supervised and nonsupervised learning."
"A model for the representation of diagnostic test-fault relationships is presented which provides increased flexibility over previous models and is adaptable to handling large-scale integrated systems. Several forms of the model are given and methods for transforming from one form to another are presented. Procedures are given for assessing the diagnostic capability of the test set and theorems are presented which give necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of the model for diagnosability with and without fault repair. Finally, the model is compared to a number of existing models to demonstrate its flexibility."
"This paper is concerned with the transformation of a single-channel (series-operated) finite-state machine into a multichannel (parallel-operated) machine, and conversely. It is shown that every single-channel machine has a multichannel analog with the same number of states. A multichannel machine has a single-channel analog if and only if a so-called \"prefix condition\" is satisfied. Algorithms are given for constructing both types of analogs with the minimum number of states."
"By a checking sequence for a sequential machine, we mean an input-output sequence with a special property such that, when the input sequence is applied to the machine, the decision whether or not the machine operates correctly can be made by comparing the output sequence with the output of the machine."
"This note describes a technique of logical design using a standard machine-language assembler as the basic tool. An analogy is drawn between the assembly of logic modules by an engineer and the compiling of instructions by a programmer. This analogy can be used to enable an assembler to generate directly, a wiring list, as well as computing such design parameters as the cost, and the power and space requirements of the design. The designer works in a macro language, where a macro may stand for a logic module or a self- contained logic circuit within a module. This language contains the essential logical design information divorced from irrelevant trivia such as the allocation of logical functions to modules and the arrangement of modules in a mounting panel. Thus, optimization of the wiring layout can be conveniently carried out after the logical design is complete. The expression of the design in macro form also allows checkout of the logic by simulation."
"This note discusses multivalued cellular cascades, i.e., one-dimensional arrays of multivalued two-input, one-output combinational cells. It is shown that a large class of multivalued combinational switching functions can be realized by such a cascade."
"A television camera represents a standardized sensing system for electronically scanning moving images. There are requirements for converting all or part of the television image into digital form, and there are distinct advantages resulting from the on-line capability. To achieve the high speed conversion and to optimize the tradeoff of all the variables involved, a special computer interface for television (CINTEL) has been developed."
"A contour-tracing technique described in an earlier paper [9] was used along with monogram, bigram, and trigram contextual constraints to recognize handprinted characters. Error probabilities decreased by factors ranging from two to four over those which resulted when contextual constraints were ignored. A simple technique for searching over only the most probable bigrams and trigrams was used to significantly reduce the computation without reducing the recognition accuracy."
"The main characteristics of some programs implementing a number of different versions of partitioned list algorithms are described, and the results of a systematic plan of experiments performed on these programs are reported. These programs concern the determination of all the prime implicants, a prime implicant covering, or an irredundant normal form of a Boolean function. The experiments performed on these programs concern mainly the computer time required, the number of prime implicants obtained, and their distribution in families. The results obtained from these tests demonstrate that relatively large Boolean functions, involving even some thousands of canonical clauses, can be very easily processed by present-day electronic computers."
"This note deals with the multiple realization of synchronous sequential machines for which the initial states are given. The results given by Smith and Kohavi, who have studied the problem for machines fed by the same input, are generalized to the case of machines having the same clock but different inputs. For these machines, a maximum common factor is defined, and it is shown how, if it exists, it can be obtained. The problem of internal state or input state splitting for machines that do not have a maximum factor and that are incomplete is not faced."
"Building on the work of Grasselli and Luccio, a new rule for reducing closure-covering (CC) tables is given and proved. Experience with the use of this new rule on actual problems with computer programs is reported. As an example of the size of problem, one 22-state four-input flow table with 261 prime compatibles and a resulting matrix for the linear integer programming problem of 504 rows and 261 columns was solved on an IBM 7094 in less than three minutes, resulting in a reduced machine with nine states."
"An algorithm for minimizing the bit dimension of READ- ONLY memories employed in the control section of microprogrammed digital computers is illustrated. The algorithm employs techniques which are well known in switching theory, such as compatibility classes and covering tables of the prime implicant type."
"Some data obtained from the simulation of a multicomputer system are described and compared with results from a semiempirical analysis of the system. The analysis indicates the dependence of system efficiency on the method of scheduling a job and on the job characterization parameters."
"In view of the recent communication by Marcus [1], the rules for generation of various combinations of input equations for the RST flip- flop [2] can be modified as in Table 1."

"It is shown that the inverse transform of a rational fraction (in s or z frequency variable) can be computed by a \"real-time deconvolver.\" Previous techniques (such as those of Fielder, Pierre, Stanley–Reis, and Ahmed–Rao) are deduced in a natural way both for continuous and sampled-data systems. Since the new method is obtained by considering the ratio of a transformed output sequence to a transformed input sequence, it also provides a procedure for dividing two power series, hence \"on-line\" linear system identification. Deconvolution then appears as the link between linear systems and automata and suggests a metamodel for algorithm representation."
"This paper concerns the design, implementation, and testing of a stored-programmed special-purpose computer that, when employed as a digital filter, satisfies the requirement of reduced deadband for the input interface element (the analog-to-digital converter). This is accomplished by using a double precision arithmetic process which employs shorter word lengths; and consequently, the physical size (component-wise) and the calculation time of the filter are reduced."
"The choice of fault detection methods to be used in control and data transfer circuits is strongly dependent on system organization. This paper presents a unified parity check scheme for both."
"Languages for describing digital systems have two messages to convey. They must provide enough information about the behavior of the system to permit simulation, and enough information about the structure of the system to indicate how it might be built. This double requirement distinguishes system description languages from conventional programming languages and necessitates special methods for documenting the meaning of the language. Such languages have a single form, or syntax, but two meanings, or semantics. Documentation of the language requires the definition of two distinct meanings."
"A new associative memory utilizing holography is described, which has advantages such as higher density and larger capacity storage, simpler peripheral devices, and reciprocal translation between different kinds of information. The advantages of the holographic associative memory were achieved by use of associative translation function of a hologram and spatial logical operations. Two types of the holographic associative memory are explained; one uses a thin hologram, and the other a thick hologram. In the latter case, the ultimate bit density of 107bits/cm2is expected. A preliminary experiment of the memory system using a thin hologram (10 words x10 interrogation bits x20 information bits) was carried out and confirmed high signal-to-noise ratio in the interrogation and read out operations, associative translation function between different information, and high reliability in the memory operation."
"In this paper an adaptive threshold logic unit is analyzed. The unit consists of a set of self-adjusting weights, a summing device, and a comparator. Its dynamic and steady-state behavior is made clear by investigating the solutions of a system of nonlinear differential equations which describes changes in the weights. In the steady state the unit separates its inputs into a family of principal components and picks out one principal component for its output. When the power of one principal component is considerably larger than that of any other, it picks out the largest-power principal component without regard to initial values of the weights. When all the principal components have nearly the same values of power, any principal component can be given as the output and the initial conditions determine which should be given. These theoretical results are verified by some simulation experiments on an analog computer. Applications of the unit to many-valued logic and signal filtering are also discussed."
"Deterministic and probabilistic sequential machine theory is used to solve the estimation, prediction, and smoothing problem encountered in noisy discrete parameter systems such as digital data processors and information processing systems. Using Bayes' theorem, the equations describing the ideal estimator, predictor, and smoother are developed. These equations are used to define an infinite-state Mealy-type sequential machine that performs these calculations."
"A homomorphism of the de Bruijn graph that maps a graph of order n onto one of order n-1 and its applications to the design of nonsingular feedback shift registers are discussed. The properties preserved under this mapping suggest a new design technique whose main advantage is due to the fact that the problem of designing a desired n-stage shift register may be reduced to a problem of order n-1 or less. Among the results obtained is a recursive formula for a feedback function that generates a cycle of maximum length."
"Simulation, Monte Carlo method, and other forms of stochastic computation consume random numbers in vast quantity and at high speed. Pseudorandom numbers or numbers generated from natural random phenomena—shot noise, thermal noise, radio-active decay, etc.,—can be used. The advantages and disadvantages of the two methods are discussed; natural random numbers are concluded to be superior in both speed and generality. A generalized natural random number generator is proposed, circuit suggestions are given, the maximum average sampling rate is derived, and recommendations for insuring incoherent operation are made."
"Some attention is currently directed toward maximizing the number of nodes in a graph, each node of which receives no more than d branches and may be reached from any other node along a path of no more than k branches. This note introduces two improved techniques for construction and provides a table (with 1≤d, k≤10) indicating the current status of this problem."
"A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a feedforward inverse for a linear sequential circuit is presented. As a result of the proof of this existence condition, a procedure for construction of feedforward inverses, when they exist, is developed. It is shown that the delay of the inverse that is realized by the construction procedure is minimal over all inverse circuits. This work is a generalization and extension of certain results obtained by Massey and Sain concerning the existence of feedforward inverses of feedforward linear sequential circuits."
"Results pertaining to the existence and choice of a suitable multiplier for a class of range transformations of multiple precision floating-point numbers with integral mantissa are presented."
"The concept of \"partition pair\" is important for the decomposition of deterministic machines. The theory of stochastic machines would be enhanced with a suitable generalization. The definition of partition pairs presented by Bacon fails in that it does not reduce to the deterministic definition for a stochastic machine which is actually deterministic. A natural definition of partition pair is presented using probability distributions rather than states."
"If a set of connectives is not functionally complete, then there is no simple way of deciding whether or not an arbitrary truth-function is expressible by a proposition-letter formula which has only the connectives in this set. In order to assert that a set of connectives is not complete with respect to a particular truth-function, it is often necessary to give a formal proof by some inductive argument. To come up with such an inductive argument is not always easy. An algorithm by which the expressive power of a set of connectives may be determined is described."
"The inversion process which entails the interchange of two adjacent elements in a list is fundamental to most practical sorting algorithms.Consequently, one can utilize the inversions associated with a given permutation as its measure of complexity. To this end a recurrence relation is established."

"An approximate method for rapid multiplication or division with relatively simple digital circuitry is described. The algorithm consists of computing approximate binary logarithms, adding or subtracting the logarithms, and computing the approximate anti- logarithm of the resultant. Using a criteria of minimum mean square error, coefficients for the approximations are developed. An error analysis is given for three cases in which the algorithm is useful. Finally, applications to digital filtering computations are considered which illustrate that log-antilog multiplication is not simpler than an array multiplier for computing single products, but is useful for parallel digital filter banks and multiplicative digital filters."
"A procedure for factoring of the N×N matrix representing the discrete Fourier transform is presented which does not produce shuffled data. Exactly one factor is produced for each factor of N, resulting in a fast Fourier transform valid for any N. The factoring algorithm enables the fast Fourier transform to be implemented in general with four nested loops, and with three loops if N is a power of two. No special logical organization, such as binary indexing, is required to unshuffle data. Included are two sample programs, one which writes the equations of the matrix factors employing the four key loops, and one which implements the algorithm in a fast Fourier transform for N a power of two. The algorithm is shown to be most efficient for Na power of two."
"In this paper we concern ourselves with the problem of obtaining high sequence rate sequential machines, machines which are constructed from realistic devices to operate at an input sequence rate which is independent of the machine complexity. To accomplish this result we have only to show a construction to realize acceptably synchronous devices from badly timed, restricted fan-in and fan-out devices. Once a complete set of synchronous devices is obtained, the results of Arden and Arthurs [ 11 apply and we know that any finite state machine has a realization using these devices which accepts input sequence members at a rate which is characteristic of the set of devices, not of the machine. The technique we propose for achieving this result is to produce a lattice of interconnected clock pulse sources called clock pulse propagators (CPPs). These devices generate clock pulses which are acceptably synchronized with respect to the outputs of neighboring CPPs but are not required to be in synchronization with some machine-wide standard as in current practice. Once it is established that such a network is possible, techniques already known can be applied in the utilization of the clock- pulses to synchronize logic and signals. Part I1of the paper concerns the analysis of CPP networks, and Part II covers the synthesis of sequential machines using CPP networks as clocking sources."
"A method for solving systems of linear inequalities, consistent and inconsistent, corresponding to the separable and nonseparable cases in pattern recognition is presented. Attempts are made to evaluate the speed and efficiency of the algorithm. It seems to compare in speed with the best algorithms for consistent systems of inequalities in the consistent case and retains remarkable speed in the inconsistent case. There are indications that in many cases it may be relied on to find a complete solution if several runs are taken, most runs achieving a nearly complete solution. The experimental evidence suggests that this is the most efficient and powerful method currently available for finding a solution which satisfies as many cases as possible in a set of linear inequalities."
"This paper is an attempt to develop minimization algorithms for switching circuits based on Reed-Muller canonic forms. In particular, algorithms are presented for obtaining minimal modulo 2 or complement modulo 2 sum-of- products (or sums) expressions of any arbitrary single-output or multiple-output switching function with fixed polarities of the input variables."
"Recent advances in integrated circuit technology and its potential advantage in logical design have motivated the search for modular synthesis techniques for logic networks. This problem may be divided into two parts: find appropriate modules; and develop efficient synthesis techniques for logic networks using a minimum number of modules. In this paper a new type of universal logic modules (ULM's) called the Q-type is presented. The Q-type ULM's are superior to the existing ULM's in the sense that they require fewer input/output terminals when n≥6 where n is the number of input variables of the ULM. Various techniques for synthesizing a logic network with a small number of ULM's are discussed. A much simpler type of modules, which is suitable to realize any symmetric or partially symmetric function and can be used as auxiliary building blocks for realizing any given logic function, is presented. A special kind of ULM's, called serially controlled ULM's which has only n+ 3 input/ output terminals, is also presented. For a ULM of this kind the signals for specifying the logic function to be realized are serially applied to one of its input terminals."
"To obtain successively improved control-variable functionsku(t), we propose to add a random perturbation δu(t) toku(t). A fast analog-computer run then solves the dynamical system equations and computes the given criterion function. If the latter has been improved, thenk+1u(t)=u(t)+δu(t) is stored digitally for the next iteration; otherwise 5u( t) is discarded and a new control pertubation is tried."
"A number of schemes for implementing a fast multiplier are presented and compared on the basis of speed, complexity, and cost. A parallel multiplier designed using the carry-save scheme and constructed from 74 series integrated circuits is described. This multiplier multiplies 10-bit by 12-bit binary numbers with a worst- case multiplication time of 520 ns. The cost of the integrated circuits was less than $ 500."
"This note points out the close relationship between some of the recently described division techniques, in which the divisor is transformed to a range close to unity. A brief theoretical analysis is presented which examines the choice of quotient digit when this type of division technique is used for conventional and signed-digit number systems."
"An improved method for the production of pictorial output on a line printer is described. A reasonable black-white contrast ratio is obtained by overprinting up to eight characters, and pseudorandom noise is used to smooth out discontinuities in the range of print densities."
"A cellular-logic approach is used to generate a family of multiple-output combinational switching circuits containing closed loops ( of the type that normally generate sequential behavior) and composed of simple gates. These networks contain fewer gates than any loop-free realizations. Some members of the family are oscillatory, while others are stable with multiple stable states, but the outputs remain quiescent in both cases. This result appears to have repercussions on some of the well-known optimality results of switching theory."
"A necessary and sufficient condition for a minimal- state stochastic sequential machine to be unique (up to renumbering the states) is described. Furthermore, a geometric characterization of the class of state-equivalent machines is given."
"The complete solution to a number theoretic problem which has applications in relay contact networks is given. As a corollary, a conjecture by Harrison is shown to be true."
"A finite automaton is a general repetitive machine if there is a path in the state graph from every final state to the start state. In this paper general repetitive events are defined in terms of certain factorization properties of the associated regular expressions, and a one-to-one onto correspondence is shown between general repetitive machines and general repetitive events."
"A method is presented which uses easily calculated probabilities to determine complete covers of prime implicant charts. Apparently the underlying principle of incomplete branching has not been applied previously to prime implicant charts. This principle differs in that branching is not carried out to complete covers, but only to a specified level, at which point each position is evaluated. All positions are then mimimaxed to the point of branching to choose the best branch. The method is easy to program and requires relatively little computer time to determine the cover. Time savings of up to 98 percent have been realized with an increase in the cost of the cover of less than 2 percent over conventional minimization methods. The method can be applied directly to any prime implicant chart, or can be used as a substitute for complete branching in charts where the application of dominance produces a cyclic chart."
"In the above mentioned paper,1Perlman has given a method of state assignment of binary sequence detectors on the assumption that \"the BSD represents a very special class of sequential networks and may be treated accordingly.\" (The BSD's are in fact a special class of networks, and their flow tables are much more ordered, resulting in a comparative ease in choosing an economical assignment.) It is suggested that the assignment be taken from BRS (binary ring sequence) such that 1) successive states through which the detector progresses when the sequence is entered are made to correspond to successive subsequences; 2) an initial state is chosen whereby one of a total of rmindelay units in the detector will track the input x at all times."
"J. L. Shanks1has given an algorithm for computing the discrete Walsh transform (abstract Fourier transform) of a sampled periodic function whose domain of definition is the set of integers modulo 2n. An algorithm of the same efficiency, using a much simpler notation, was given for the abstract Fourier transform in my correspondence published in 1963 in this TRANSACrIONS.2This transform has an identical matrix representation; the only difference is that the function domain is represented (for computation purposes) by binary coded representations of the integers from 0 to 2n−1. These binary n-tuples form a group under vector addition, modulo two."

"A hybrid computer is described for implementing decision-directed estimators for the two-class unsupervised estimation problem. Extensions of the system design to the multiclass problem has significant application to computerized medical diagnosis and other problems in communications and pattern recognition. These problems include resolving multiple target bearings in sonar and radar, clustering data such as arise in cell processing, locating modes in density functions for use in interactive data analysis systems, data compression, elimination of intersymbol interference, and many others."
"The \"hidden-line problem\" for computer-drawn polyhedra is the problem of determining which edges, or parts of edges, of a polyhedra are visible from a given vantage point. This is an important problem in computer graphics, and its fast solution is especially critical for on-line CRT display applications. The method presented here for solving this problem is believed to be faster than previously known methods. An edge classification scheme is described that eliminates at once most of the totally invisible edges. The remaining, potentially visible edges are then tested in paths, which eventually cover the whole polyhedra. These paths are synthesized in such a way as to minimize the number of calculations. Both the case of a cluster of polyhedra and the illumination problem in which a polyhedron is illuminated from a point source of light are treated as applications of the general algorithm. Several illustrative examples are included."
"Dynamic microprogramnming (i. e., utilizing a READ/ WRITE microstorage) allows the structure of a computer to be altered to suit a problem at hand and results in major efficiencies (an order of magnitude) in running time for nonarithmetic programs (e. g., compilers)."
"Adoption of a negative radix for number representation results in a system that is totally indifferent to the sign of the number. Compared to the sign-magnitude representation, the approach considered here requires one extra digit."
"This paper describes division schemes which are derived from the classical functional iterative schemes. These schemes are compared with t he schemes currently used in the high- speed digital computers."
"A method of essential hazard correction avoiding the insertion of delay elements into the feedback branches of an asynchronous switching circuit was suggested in a recent paper by Armstrong, Friedman, and Menon [4]. This method is always easily applicable when the line stray delays can be neglected, but the resulting circuit often contains branches with more than two levels of logical elements."
"An algorithm for obtaining all simple disjunctive decompositions of a switching function is described. The algorithm proceeds by testing for all decompositions with a bound set of size two. Under given conditions, this test for a pair of variables will show that some larger bound sets, containing the two variables for which the test was conducted, cannot yield a decomposition. The remaining bound sets require further testing. Thus this algorithm differs from existing techniques in that it attempts to test fewer bound sets at the expense of additional analysis. The relative merit of this algorithm is discussed."
"The techniques for switching circuit synthesis rely heavily on the representations of the signals in the network. In this note a field-element representation and some synthesis techniques are discussed. An advantage of using field-element representations is that algebraic manipulations can be performed on the descriptions, simplifying some minimization problems. The networks which are minimized use components which perform operations on field elements. This representation may be useful for describing some of the problems which arise in larger interconnections of logical circuits."
"This paper shows that 1) there exist at least four types of binary-input binary-output maximum-memory n-state machines for any n; 2) there exist binary-input ternary-output maximum output -memory n-state machines for any n; and 3) there exists a binary- input binary-output maximum output-memory n-state machine for n≤5."
"A systematic fault-diagnosis procedure to locate all the faulty main-array columns and faulty rotated-array rows is presented. A simple method for repairing a cutpoint cellular array when the rotated array is not limited to being used as a collector array is given."
"In this short note, the realization of an arbitrary switching function by an interconnection of threshold and parity elements is considered. Using several criteria, it is shown that parity functions and threshold functions are \" opposites.\" This dis- similarity between threshold and parity elements coupled with the useful physical properties of parity elements indicates that a realization employing the two types of modules should be of interest. Since the modules realizing parity functions are identical, mass production can be employed to reduce the cost of realization. A particular two- level configuration of threshold and parity elements is discussed. The first level consists of parity elements and the second level consists of a single threshold element. It is shown that any switching function can be realized with the proposed structure. An optimal procedure for minimizing the number of parity elements in the realization is given. Furthermore, a suboptimal procedure which is much simpler than the optimal one is also proposed."
"A transferable, utility grade, FORTRAN subroutine is described which sorts lists of arbitrary length and simultaneously resequences up to ten additional lists so as to retain a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of these additional lists and those of the list being sorted. Lists within lists may be sorted. A simple CALL permits all options and parameters to be specified. The code is based on the algorithm SHELLSORT."

"A system design is given for a computer capable of efficient execution of APL source statements and programs. The system is organized in a new type computer architecture based upon the storage of matrices and vectors in cellular logic arrays. Almost all of the scalar, mixed, and composite fixed point APL operations are implemented on the machine by algorithms given in this paper. The detailed logical design of the machine has not been completed; however, all the needed logic and memory has been specified. Also, the functions that each hardware cell must be able to perform have been specified. The algorithms for most APL operations are presented in flow charts or tables which give the detailed data flow produced by the execution of each APL operation in the machine."
"This paper describes an algorithm which will generate all the prime implicants of a Boolean function. The algorithm is different from those previously given in the literature, and in many cases it is more efficient. It is proved that the algorithm will find all the prime implicants. The algorithm may possibly generate some nonprime implicants. However, using frequency orderings on literals, the experiments with the algorithm show that it usually generates very few ( possibly none) nonprime implicants. Furthermore, the algorithm may be used to find the minimal sums of a Boolean function. The algorithm is implemented by a computer program in the LISP language."
"The Karhunen-Lo6ve expansion has been used previously to extract important features for representing samples taken from a given distribution. A method is developed herein to use the Karhunen-Loeve expansion to extract features relevant to classification of a sample taken from one of two pattern classes. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the technique."
"This paper presents an extension of the concept of linear separation to generate a wider class of Boolean functions. This generalization is affected by modifying the requirements for separation to allow both true and false assignments to reside on the same hyperplane (pseudoseparation) or within the same neighborhood of a hyperplane (marginal separation). Boolean functions which can be separated in either of these ways are called partially separable functions. This paper is divided into two parts. The first deals with pseudoseparable functions and the second deals with marginally separable functions. Some of the theoretical algebraic properties of partially separable functions are investigated, and the relationship between these and the corresponding properties for separable functions is explored. Necessary and sufflcient conditions for each type of separation are also discussed, A parameter which shows whether a given Boolean function is separable, pseudoseparable, or marginally separable is introduced."
"This paper describes a new method for the state minimization of incompletely specified sequential machines. Previously described methods start with generating all maximal compatibles of states of the original incompletely specified machine and then try to find a closed cover which consists of a minimal number of MCs or portions of MCs. This process involves a long enumeration process and, as the number of states grows, turns out to be impractical for hand calculation."
"Let Rnmbe the number of linearly separable n-argument functions specified on some m points of the n-cube. Let R̄nmand Ṟnmbe, respectively, the minimum and maximum values attained over all choices of the m points. It is known that R̄nm<2mn/n!. 1) Two published \"simplifications\" of the argument which establish this upper bound are shown to be fallacious. 2) It is proved that Ṟnm≥4m(lg m−1)/2. 3) It is proved that if m is less than exponential in n, then as n→∞, R̄nm≈(m/n)n + lower order terms. 4) Let Lnmbe the maximum number of threshold gates needed to realize an arbitrary n-argument switching function specified on m points. It is shown that Lnm≳2(m/lg m)1/2."
"This note is concerned with the realization of sequential machines without logic, i. e., using delay elements only. The other approach to the problem deals with only the next-state behavior and tends to be rather long. A new approach is presented for not only the next-state behavior, but also for the complete behavior. Beginning with the output partitions, the predecessors are found until the process terminates with an input partition, a trivial partition, a previously found partition, or a nontrivial function of input and internal states. Whenever the latter occurs, the machine requires logic. With respect to the next-state behavior, it is first shown that a permutation machine is logic-free if and only if it is autonomous. Then since the next-state behavior of a feedback-free machine is realizable without logic, a machine is logic-free realizable if and only if M, is autonomous."
"A class of Boolean functions arising naturally from a consideration of the periodicities of multithreshold functions is defined and the basic properties of these functions, the completely periodic functions, are determined. The observation that this class is invariant under the group of affine transformations allows for a tabulation of the completely periodic functions of up to four variables. Finally, bounds on the number of completely periodic functions of n variables are determined."
"A limitation in the application of the technique of iterative consensus to multiple-output functions is discussed. A brief example is given, and a solution to the limitation is offered."
"This correspondence describes a method of computing the Hadamard transform and the R-transform. This method produces the transform components in the order of the increasing sequency of the Walsh functions represented by the rows of a symmetric Hadamard matrix for which the sequency of each row is larger than the sequency of the preceding row."
"This correspondence demonstrates an improvement on Winogard's algorithm for inner products as applied to the multiplication of two matrices."
"In the above-mentioned paper, Henrichon and Fu present a non- parametric procedure for multivariate, multiclass pattern classification. They obtain a confidence bound on the probability of error through the theory of distribution-free tolerance regions. However, their procedure for obtaining a confidence bound on the basis of a sample from each class is not valid."
"The authors wish to thank G. W. Beakley and F. B. Tuteur for their identification of a source of difficulty in the analysis of the non- parametric procedure as originally proposed. We shall reexamine our analysis in the light of this new development and will report on any modifications at a later date."

"In an earlier paper [11] a scheme for detecting errors in ADD, COMPLEMENT, SHIFT, and ROTATE operations using a residue check circuitry was presented. A scheme for error location and correction in those operations is derived by a suitable application of a code called biresidue arithmetic code described here. Any single error position can be located and also corrected by use of two residue checkers which work separately and in parallel with the arithmetic unit. The estimated cost of redundancy is approximately the same as that required for duplication of the arithmetic unit."
"A dynamic memory allocation algorithm is presented making use of a priori information about a computer program. A two- level storage system is assumed, and a replacement algorithm is developed based upon a priori knowledge of interaction factors between any two space-taking entities associated with a computation."
"The decomposition property, a necessary condition for linearity, is defined for discrete-time systems. N-state machines with this property have finite memory μ≤N−1. Linear and autonomous systems are important classes of systems with decomposition. Several representations of systems with decomposition are given and a general form of the discrete-time state equations for a finite-memory system with decomposition is derived. An algorithm is developed by which an arbitrary complete-sequential machine may be tested for decomposition."
"Some parameters related to the computational complexity of partitioned list algorithms are evaluated. Specifically, an upper bound is computed for the average number of comparisons needed by the most unsophisticated version of a partitioned list algorithm for processing a Boolean function in v variables and u canonical clauses. For the same functions the average memory size required for processing is also computed. Furthermore the minimum memory size necessary for processing any Boolean function in u canonical clauses by either a partitioned or a nonpartitioned list algorithm is computed. Results obtained from the above comparisons demonstrate that partitioned list algorithms compare favorably with nonpartitioned ones both with regard to the time and the memory required for computation."
"This paper is devoted to the development of procedures for synthesizing threshold-logic elements which can be employed in redundant networks based on the von Neumann multiplexing principle. A major result is the statement of rules for synthesizing elements whose outputs are correct despite the presence of e or fewer errors on the input lines. Several theorems are proved and used as the basis for establishing synthesis rules for four canonical redundant threshold element specifications. Some of these canonical elements are optimum in the sense that they require the minimum sum of weights or minimum sum of input bundle sizes."
"The Berkeley array processor is a special-purpose computer designed to perform the operations of correlation, convolution, recursive filtering, matrix multiplication, as well as a variant of the Cooley-Tukey algorithm, and others. This note describes the logical organization and performance of this device."
"It is known that R linearly separable classes of multidimensional pattern vectors can always be represented in a feature space of at most R dimensions. An approach is developed which can frequently be used to find a nonorthogonal transformation to project the patterns into a feature space of considerably lower dimensionality. Examples involving classification of handwritten and printed digits are used to illustrate the technique."
"The notion of graphs solvable with finite delay appears in [1] and [4]. In this note the upper bound on finite delay for a graph with N nodes is reduced to the order of 2N2using techniques from finite automata theory."
"Events representable in stochastic sequential machines, as defined previously by several authors, are shown to be regular in certain cases. The construction of deterministic machines representing those events is implicit."

"This book consists of two parts, the first being a survey of the mathematical theory of Boolean functions. Chapter 1 introduces basic definitions, various normal forms, prime implicants, and symmetric functions. In an appendix to Chapter 1, an unpublished combinatorial and nontrivial theorem of Bakos is given. (This theorem yields a uniform construction of Gray codes as a consequence.) Chapter 2 gives the standard theory of minimality. Applications to special cases such as monotonic or symmetric functions are given. Chapter 3 discusses interrelationships between conjunctive and disjunctive normal forms. Chapter 4 deals with functional completeness and the Post–Yablonsky theorem is proven. Some applications to finite automata are given. Chapter 5 is concerned with the decomposition of truth functions. Chapter 6, on numerical problems, is particularly good. Groups are used to classify truth functions. A form of Pólya's theorem is given and the work of Pólya, Slepian, and the reviewer is presented. A number of special cases are worked out, including some of the results of Povarov. Chapter 7, on linearly separable functions, gives a number of characterizations."
"Although considerable progress has been made in the understanding of the more \"algebraic\" properties of context-free languages, the quantitative aspects of the recognition and parsing of context- free languages are still far from well understood. It was shown by Kasami and Younger that for every context-free language there exists a multitape Turing machine which recognizes this language and uses no more than n3operations to process input words of length n. For one-tape Turing machines Hartmanis showed, using the Younger algorithm, that every context-free language can be recognized in n5operations. This result has now been improved in the paper under review. It is shown, by a careful implementation of the Torii–Kasami–Ozaki algorithm on a one-tape Turing machine, that every context-free language can be recognized in n4operations. Again, just like for the n3operation multitape result, it is not known how good this time bound is. On the other hand, the authors have been able to show in this paper that for linear context-free languages n2is the least-upper time bound for their recognition on one-tape Turing machines. This is done by showing that every linear language is n2-recognizable, and by recalling that there are linear languages whose recognition requires n2 operations on a one-tape machine."
"A nested stack automaton is a generalization of the pushdown automaton. Basically, the nested stack automaton consists of an input tape, a finite control, and a single pushdown list. However, the nested stack automaton can access symbols in the interior of the stack in a read-only mode and create new stacks nested (to arbitrary depths) within the main stack, subject to the restriction that the stack head may not move up a stack without first having destroyed all stacks created at that level. The importance of the model is that the class of languages accepted is precisely the indexed languages. The indexed languages have most of the properties of the context- free languages, i.e., derivation trees, recursiveness, decidable emptiness problem, closed under concatenation, Kleene closure, homomorphisms, inverse homomorphisms, and intersection with regular sets. Furthermore, the indexed grammars are capable of exhibiting syntactic features in algorithmic programming languages not representable by context-free grammars."
"A stochastic language is a set of words accepted by a probabilistic automaton with some cutpoint. The structure of the family of stochastic languages may not parallel the structure of the family of regular languages. Some stochastic languages are context-free languages which are nonregular. The basic questions of when the complement of a stochastic language is a stochastic language, or when the intersection or union of two stochastic languages is stochastic, have not been solved but have been illuminated by Turakainen's work. Turakainen proves that like the context-free languages, the intersection of a stochastic language and a regular language is a stochastic language. He shows as well that the union of a stochastic language and regular language is also a stochastic language. All right derivatives of a stochastic language are stochastic languages. In the same volume as Turakainen's paper, Nasu and Honda have proven what amounts to the fact that the reversal of a stochastic language is a stochastic language. They also show other basic properties."
"By \"zero–one programming\" the authors mean linear mathematical programming with variables that can take on only the values 0 or 1. Such problems are of great practical importance—arising, for example, when optimality is sought in such contexts as airline crew scheduling, capital budgeting, disk balancing, menu planning, plant location, political apportionment, and project selection. A great deal of effort has been expended in recent years in quest of efficient algorithms, as is evident from the size of the literature that has grown up. The authors give a rather superficial review of the \"implicit enumeration\" portion of this literature. An attempt is made to indicate the nature of the algorithms proposed by the following authors and, in most cases, to show how their proposals relate to the framework for implicit enumeration exposited by the reviewer.1 These authors are Glass, Balas, Glover, Lawler and Bell, Geoffrion, Lemke and Spielberg, Balintfy, and Healy. A brief discussion of comparative computational experience is given, and the tentative conclusion offered that the reviewer's algorithm2 \"seems to be the most promising of existing converging algorithms.\""
"This paper reviews the impact of solid-state technology on the design and implementation of analog computers. Eight figures show the effects of transistors and medium-scale integrated circuits in the various phases of computer development. Basically, the use of integrated circuits is divided into two areas: logic and linear. Logic, or digital, circuits have been used for the control and address selection in the analog computer. Contrary to the author's claim that electromechanical devices used in the 1958 vintage machines were reliable with proper maintenance, transistor control logic was introduced specifically to improve the reliability and speed of the analog computer. (I do not believe that anyone who had to maintain stepping switches would disagree with me.) The introduction of patchable logic combined with the transistor control logic was a big step forward in increasing flexibility for the computer operator. As integrated circuits became practical from the viewpoint of cost per function, the control and patchable logic changed over to integrated circuits with additional features and flexibility."
"The purpose of this paper is to provide a broad review of a class of unconventional computational methods for solving certain partial differential equations. The most widely used analog and digital techniques for solving initial-value problems involve the discretization of the space domain, with the aid of finite difference approximations. In the case of digital methods, there results a set of algebraic equations which must be solved for each step in the time domain. In analog techniques, finite difference approximations lead to a set of simultaneous ordinary differential equations, one for each grid point in this space domain. These equations can then be integrated using analog integrators. Although quite general in their applicability, finite differences methods often entail excessive and uneconomical computational efforts. This shortcoming, as well as the desire to explore new potential applications for hybrid computers, has led a number of investigators to experiment with alternative techniques, techniques which the author of the paper under review has chosen to classify as functional approximation methods."
"The author develops a method for finding stability contours which provide a means for analyzing \"in the large\" stability characteristics of hybrid loops including the effects of sampling, delay, and various types of hold circuits. The method provides a meaningful tool for comparing the results of different methods of digital and analog compensation."
"A stochastic approximation, or stochastic gradient procedure, is a method of estimating the minimum of a criterion function despite the random effects of noise. It was originally conceived by the mathematician as a means of estimating the minimum of a regression function. In recent years, however, stochastic approximation has received considerable attention in the engineering field because of its potential application to learning systems, parameter estimation, and automatic control."

"Three methods are described for the representation of continuous functions as lattice polynomials in terms of a set of generators. They are two-stage-parallel, three-stage-parallel, and series- parallel. Each representation is in direct correspondence with an analog function generator."
"Automized stabilization and control of computer-controlled nonlinear processes is considered. A new algorithm which constitutes a combination of Popov's and of Jury and Lee's stability criteria with a nonlinear programming approach is proposed. The algorithm is applied to a digitally controlled antenna tracking system and the operation is simulated on an IBM 360/91 computer. The solution involves a novel application of nonlinear programming algorithms to problems with complex variables. A comparative study of various unconstrained minimization methods used by the proposed algorithm was performed."
"An algorithm for allocation of memory resources is presented making use of a priori information about a computer program. This static allocation algorithm is based on a directed graph model of computations with particular attention to the memory allocation of programs assigned for execution on multiprocessor systems."
"A common recursive formulation is presented for determining: 1) all the prime implicants, and 2) an irredundant normal form of any completely or incompletely specified Boolean function given in canonical form. Formulas for specific operators Pi and lrr2 solving these problems are given and recursive partitioned list algorithms are described for them. The solution of both of the above problems through recursive partitioned list algorithms is significantly faster than through the corresponding nonrecursive algorithms."
"In the present paper efforts have been made to arrive at the three-level NAND network of any general Boolean function by utilizing its complementary function. It has been shown that the knowledge of the complementing gates of the three-level NAND circuit with minimum number of gates in the AND level can readily be obtained from the study of the prime implicants of the complementary function. A reduced form of the Cover and Closure (CC) table is suggested which is applicable in the above three-level NAND network synthesis. The paper also deals with the recognition of the class of functions for which the use of the CC table may be avoided to obtain the same network."
"The problem of decomposing an asynchronous sequential circuit into the serial connection of two asynchronous sequential circuits is considered. Six types of serial connections are defined, and necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for making five of the six types of serial decomposition, while sufficient conditions are derived for the sixth. Systematic and constructive procedures are presented for making each of the decompositions."
"A queuing model with a limited waiting room (buffer), Poisson arrivals, multiple synchronous servers (synchronous transmission channels), and constant services is studied. Using traffic intensity and number of transmission lines as parameters, the relationships among overflow probabilities, buffer size, and expected queuing delay due to buffering are obtained. These relationships are represented in graphs which are provided as a guide to the design of buffer systems. An example is given to illustrate the use of these results in buffer design problems. In addition, the procedure to design an optimal buffer system in the sense of minimal cost (tradeoff between buffer cost and transmission cost) is discussed."
"Solved for is the expected swap time expended for those customers in the system of queues in general models of time- shared systems. This quantity is expressed in terms of the expected queueing time conditioned on required service time and is applied to a number of examples of interest."
"A contour-tracing technique originally devised by Clemens and Mason was modified and used with several different classifiers to recognize upper case handprinted characters. Recognition accuracies obtained compare favorably with other published results, particularly when additional simple tests are performed to differentiate commonly confused characters. One suboptimum classifier, in addition to yielding near optimum performance when tested on training data, uses much less statistical information than the optimum Bayes classifier and is significantly better than the optimum classifier when training and test data are limited."
"An inexpensive computer graphical input device giving Cartesian coordinates with better than 1-mm resolution is described. The technique works equally well for two-or three-dimensional input variants of the device."
"The concept of lossless state or system is generalized by the definition of k-losslessness. If k>N( N-1)/2 for an N-state machine, k-lossless implies lossless. The series connection of a set of discrete time systems {Ai}, where Ai is ki-lossless, results in a system which is min{ki}-lossless. This result is a simple verification of the intuitive notion that a noiseless communication channel is only as lossless as the most lossy system in the channel. By means of input- output pair analysis, systems with the decomposition property (one of the necessary but not sufficient conditions for linearity) are shown to be information-lossless of finite order m, when one state has finite order m. Further, every state must have exactly the same order. For an N-state system with decomposition and zero-state linearity, information-lossless implies information-lossless of finite order m≤N. As a consequence, all information-lossless linear sequential machines used as encoders allow decoding to begin after m received symbols, provided that the encoder's starting state is known in advance."
"A methodical procedure for organization of fault detection experiments for synchronous sequential machines possessing distinguishing sequences (DS) is given. The organization is based on the transition checking approach. The checking experiment is considered in three concatenative parts: 1) the initial sequence which brings the machine under test into a specific state, 2) the α-sequence to recognize all the states and to establish the information about the next states under the input DS, and 3) the β-sequence to check all the individual transitions in the state table."

"The above-mentioned paper by K. S. Menger1 presents a restatement of logic functions in terms of the \"macroelements\" of Galois field (GF) arithmetic. Against the current background of LSI technology, this high- level hardware is going to be a welcome development."
"As R. Reeves points out, use of the SQUARE module can simplify realizations and save on the more expensive TIMES module. (However, the TIMES module requires only 2n inputs, not 7n.) Indeed, my final paragraph in Section VI mentions assignments by Edwards for which the SQUARE module (as well as the FOURTH POWER module, EIGHTH POWER module, etc.) require no logic gates whatsoever. Their usefulness arises precisely for the reason illustrated by Mr. Reeves' realization shown in his Fig. 1."

"Wiring schemes which exploit the potential of modern integrated circuit technology are likely to exhibit a high degree of \" periodicity,\" as well as various other attributes. The first contribution of this paper is to formulate a precise definition of periodicity in terms of a graph-theoretic model originated by Yoeli. Roughly speaking, an infinite graph is said to be periodic if it can be generated from a finite template which is moved (periodically) from point to point in the plane. This definition is interesting and useful, and generalizes nicely to infinite graphs in n-space."
"This paper contributes to the literature on tree automata (also known as algebra automata), which is providing new insights at the interface between automata theory and formal language theory—an interface which hopefully will show increasing relevance both to linguists and compiler writers. Formal language theory has long employed pushdown automata, linear bounded automata, etc., to process, parse, and recognize the strings of a formal language. Lurking in the background have been the derivation trees which show how such strings can be derived by various rewriting rules from some initial symbol. The new approach (spurred by the linguists' interest in transformational grammars which actually transform derivation trees, and by Buchi's observation—built upon by such workers as Mezei, Thatcher, Eilenberg, Wright, and Giveon in the pages of Information and Control—that ordinary automata may be viewed as a special kind of universal algebra) looks at automata that act directly on the trees, rather than on the strings they produce."
"The late John von Neumann took an interest in a mechanical modeling of self-reproducing phenomena of living things, which are far more complex and purposeful than a mere regeneration of a facsimile of the structures found, for example, in the growth of a crystal in a solution of the constituent substance. After some initial work with some kinematic models of such phenomena, he found a two-dimensional array of identical finite-state machines to be a convenient medium in which to study self- reproducing phenomena represented as the successive state distributions of finite state machines[1]."
"This paper is concerned primarily with methods of diagnosis, as opposed with detection of (single-gate) failures in combinational circuits, with but one primary output. Most previous papers in this area have been concerned with diagnosis and have neglected the detection problem. One result of interest is that it is shown that \"for complete diagnosis the number of tests which must be applied to the circuit is proportional to the number of gates and is independent of the number of primary input terminals.\" Assumed but not given in their method is an algorithm for the purpose of computing a test to distinguish between two failures if such exists."
"This paper is based on the following idea. If the two residues xi⋅ f(x) and } x̄i⋅ f(x) are realizable, respectively, with p and q threshold gates, then f is realizable with at most p+q gates. And conversely, if the residues require separately at least r gates, then so does f. Thus, given a table of minimal realizations for 4-argument functions (which require at most three gates), realizations for 5-argument functions can be obtained which are demonstrably minimal or close to it, by considering the five different pairs of residues."
"The automaton decomposition procedure described by Zeiger1 does not necessarily yield a unique cascade decomposition of a given machine M. This paper describes some characteristics of the machines in any such decomposition of M which may be predicted by examining states of M that are permuted under some input sequence x. The principal results fall into three main categories: cascade consequences of tapes which permute proper subsets of QM, the sate set of M; consequences of symbols which permute QM; and the decomposition of definite automata."
"This paper deals with the realization of the combinatorial logic network of sequential machines with threshold logic elements, with a view to one- level realization. The state assignment problem is already a difficult one, and here it is further complicated by the restriction that the logical gates to be used are all threshold logic elements. This problem is quite important and is worthy of intensive study because, although threshold logic element as a general gate is well known, its value is not fully appreciated unless its applicability in various situations is demonstrated."

"This paper describes an on-line interactive graphics system which has been designed to solve the problems of pattern analysis and pattern classification. A wide variety of both classical and unique mathematical algorithms, along with their graphic system implementation, are discussed. A discussion of an application of the system to the handprinted character recognition problem is included."
"The aim of this paper is to obtain a procedure for finding a minimum state nondeterministic finite automaton (NDA) equivalent to a given (in general, nondeterministic) finite automaton. Given a finite automaton A, we derive from A a matrix of 1' s and 0's, called a reduced automaton matrix RAM) of A, in a certain way and show that each state of A corresponds to a grid over the RAM. A grid consists of a set of rows and a set of columns of an RAM such that only 1's appear at the intersections. It is also shown that the union of all the grids, each of which corresponds to a state of A, covers all the 1 entries of an RAM."
"This paper describes a new approach to the design of combinational logic using large-scale integrated (LSI) circuit technology. A simple \"prototype\" logic function of n binary variables is imbedded within an array of at most (n+1) rows and columns. The cells of this array contain two-input EXCLUSIVE-OR gates, and its rows are fed by the input variables and logical \"1.\" Its column outputs are first-degree polynomial functions of the input variables. These functions supply inputs to, and modify the output of, the prototype in order to realize the desired function. These transformations form a group; specifically, the largest subgroup of the (n+1)-dimensional affine group such that input variable encodings are not affected by feedback from the function's output."
"Methods already exist for the construction of critical race-free assignments for asynchronous sequential circuits. Some of these methods permit the construction of many assignments for the same flow table. The algorithm presented here consists of two easy to apply tests which select that critical race-free assignment most likely to produce a set of simple next-state equations. The algorithm has been programmed."
"This paper shows how a \"unity-ratio\" totally sym-metric function can be identified without any further decomposition. The identification is carried out by writing the given function in its ordered partitioned tabular form. The method is general, straightforward, and programmable on a digital computer."
"A nonparametric training procedure capable of processing an arbitrary sequence of patterns based on stochastic approximation techniques is considered. An acceleration scheme based on the adaptive Robbins-Monro procedure to increase the rate of convergence and to make the estimation asymptotically efficient is proposed. This scheme has been applied to the problem of recognition of handwritten characters."
"The original multivalued algebra defined by Post in 1921 [1] included the cyclization operation in its generating set. Up to now the algebra has not been used for the synthesis of ternary digital systems because of two shortcomings: no simple canonical forms are possible, and the cyclization is difficult to implement."
"The Gray code counter is stated to be an accidental result of the logical design of a binary counter which has two memory elements per stage."
"To seek the origins of Gray codes is to peer farther into the past than 1947. As mentioned in our note, the structure of our counter was suggested by the \"Chinese rings\" puzzle; the codes themselves can describe solutions to the \"Tower of Hanoi\" puzzle (see our [4]). More recent uses of the unitdistance principle may also be found.4"

"The book provides a new and interesting approach to the field of information and communication theory and is a welcome and thought- provoking exposition on a subject too often reviewed by conventional Fourier methods. Dr. Harmuth develops a generalized theory of signal transmission based on the concepts of orthogonal functions, the subject of his first chapter. His presentation is soon directed to the particular class of orthogonal functions known as the system of Walsh functions which have the convenient property of taking on only plus and minus unity values. Thus his subject becomes particularly relevant to the transistor and integrated circuit technology of today. The mathematical theories expounded in the text are unique in that experimental implementation is not far away. The first chapter develops the analytic tools necessary for applying the generalized orthogonal function theory to Walsh function applications in various phases of the communication process. The chapter is exemplary of Dr. Harmuth's historical accuracy and scholarly style in his exacting references of authors of both published and unpublished works contributing to this area. The fifteen pages of references at the end of the text attest to this fact."
"In the design of synchronous sequential machines, various canonical realizations which make use of feedback shift registers have been developed oped [1], [2]. This paper attempts to extend some of these results to realize asynchronous machines in a similar manner."
"The paper begins with a good formal introduction to iterative arrays, discussing briefly their relation to other automata, particularly the \"tessellation structures\" of Moore [1] and von Neumann [2]. Attention is then restricted to iterative arrays viewed as real-time tape acceptors. The author proves a speedup theorem, which shows how to speed up an array by a constant factor k. The speedup is done by using a length k encoding of the input tapes, and realizing blocks of the array as finite-state machines in a new array which operates k times as fast. The complexity classes of arrays defined by the author ignore the complexity of the modules of which the array is composed. Thus, the speeded-up array is a member of the same class of arrays as the array whose behavior it imitates. The author then proves that the pattern of interconnection (\"stencil\") of any array may be reduced to allow direct communication only between nearest neighbors without reducing the real-time computing power of the array. This again involves increasing the complexity of the finite-state machines in the array."
"An arbitrary sequential machine M may or may not be able to be decomposed into a series-parallel interconnection of two or more smaller machines. It seems natural to ask the following."
"H. Wang (\"Circuit synthesis by solving sequential Boolean equations,\" Zeit. für Math. Logik und Grundlagen der Math., vol. 5 pp. 291-322, 1959) pointed out that sequential Boolean equations, obtained by adding a sequential operator to take care of the time element to the ordinary Boolean operations, provided a convenient language for expressing conditions to be satisfied by circuits or automata. Among other things he described algorithms for deciding whether an equation has a solution, and for deciding whether it has a solution with finite delay. The present paper presents algorithms which are thought to be more efficient."
"This paper is concerned with the recognition of words which are contained in languages defined by pushdown store machines. Such languages exhibit many of the syntactic properties of algorithmic programming languages. Thus the recognition problem for languages generated by pushdown store machines is related to compilation of programming languages."

"This paper describes a sequential suboptimal test selection procedure for a combinational logic circuit. The goal is package level diagnosis assuming a single permanent fault and multiple outputs. The method extends to multiple permanent faults and/or a single output since the starting point is a fault table of test inputs as columns, faults as rows, and resulting output as the entry."

 "The process of converting arbitrary real numbers into a floating-point format is formalized as a mapping of the reals into a specified subset of real numbers. The structure of this subset, the set of n significant digit base β floating-point numbers, is analyzed and properties of conversion mappings are determined. For a restricted conversion mapping of the n significant digit base δ numbers to the m significant-digit base δ numbers, the one-to-one, onto, and order- preserving properties of the mapping are summarized. Multiple conversions consisting of a composition of individual conversion mappings are investigated and some results of the invariant points of such compound conversions are presented. The hardware and software implications of these results with regard to establishing goals and standards for floating-point formats and conversion procedures are considered."
"This paper relates previous analyses of the binary SRT division to the theory of multiplier recoding. Since each binary quotient digit has three possible values, the quotient resulting from the SRT division is in recoded form; in this paper it is shown that the recoding is a function of the divisor, and the method for determining the characteristic Boolean function of the recoding is presented. The relationship between the division and the recoding is established by scaling the division in such a way that the scaled \"divisor\" becomes a constant. Higher radix results are also discussed."
"In order to avoid the time delays associated with linearly convergent division based on subtraction, other iterative schemes can be used. These are based on 1) series expansion of the reciprocal, 2) multiplicative sequence, or 3) additive sequence convergent to the quotient. These latter techniques are based on finding the root of an arbitrary function at either the quotient or reciprocal value. A Newton-Raphson iteration or root finding iteration can be used."
"This paper presents a method of performing the binary multiplication beyond the scheme of multiple ADD and SHIFT. The binary multiplication algorithm will be discussed first, followed by block decoding method, logic implementation, hardware consideration, and two examples which are at the end of the discussion."
"LX-1 is an integrated circuit prototype of a microprocessor which is being used as a design vehicle to study the problems associated with the design and implementation of a similar computer constructed with large-scale integrated circuits. The organizational simplicity of LX-1 is emphasized and the supporting microprogramming and simulation facilities are discussed and examples are given."
"In keeping with the experimental nature of the Illinois Pattern Recognition Computer (ILLIAC III), the arithmetic units are intended to be a practical testing ground for recent theoretical work in computer arithmetic. This paper describes the use of redundant number systems and the design of a structure with which multiplication and division are executed radix 256. The heart of the unit is the stored-sign subtracter, a recently discovered member of the family of borrow-save subtracters and carry-save adders. A cascade of these subtracters, controlled by a multiplier recoder, provides multiplication. The same structure, controlled by a \"model division\" (a quotient recoder), performs division."
"The advent of large-scale integration of logic circuits requires the definition of digital computer structure in terms of large functional arrays of logic of very few types. This paper describes a single-package arithmetic processor called the arithmetic building element (ABE). The ABE accepts operands in either conventional or signed-digit radix-r representation and produces signed-digit results, which the ABE can reconvert to conventional form. Radix 16 is chosen for illustrations. Arrays of ABE's may be arranged to implement unit- time parallel addition, all-combinational multiplication, and more complex functions which are presently computed by subroutines. To facilitate such arithmetic design, a graph model is developed which permits a translation of the given arithmetical algorithm into an interconnection diagram of ABE's. The design procedure is illustrated by an array for polynomial evaluation. Speed, cost, and roundoff error of the array are considered. A computer program has been written for the automatic translation of the algorithm graph to an interconnection graph, and for the evaluation of the cost and speed for a given polynomial degree and a given precision requirement."
"To meet the challenge created by the advent of large- scale integration, a unique microelectronic arithmetic building element and combinational arithmetic nets, composed of the building elements, have been studied and proposed for arithmetic processor design. A fast division algorithm, particularly suitable for floating- point arithmetic, has also been developed for signed-digit arithmetic. This algorithm is characterized by the need of preprocessing the divisor and then exact generation of quotient digits. This paper describes the implementation of this division algorithm with the arithmetic building element and combinational arithmetic nets. The intention here is to explore the feasibility of applying large-scale integration technology to arithmetic processors."
"An adder is described for addition of a large number of binary numbers xj, j=1, 2, ⋯, m, where xj=∑ixji⋅ 2i, xji=0, 1, i=0, 1, ⋯, n-1. The adder's algorithm has two parts: 1) the bits xjiare added independently for each binary order i:si=∑jxji≦m and the result expressed in the binary form si=∑kaik, ⋅ 2k, aik=0, 1, k=0, 1,⋯, p-1 (where 2p-1≦m<2p); 2) the sum y=∑jxjis formed by adding terms sik·2i+kas contributions of the bit sikto the total y. A hardware implementation of this algorithm is suggested where the sum s; is obtained by a sequential circuit which reorders the values xjiso that their sum si, remains unchanged and so that after the reordering the new values xjiiobey the conditions xj+1,i≦xjifor every j=1, 2,⋯, m-1. The implementation with integrated circuits should be quite rewarding because the control of the circuit is done with independent control elements distributed all over the chip."
"We consider a residue number system using n pairwise relatively prime moduli m1,⋯,mnto represent any integer X in the range M/ 2≤X>M/2, when M = ∏mi. The moduli miare chosen to be of the 2-1 type, in order that the residue arithmetic can be implemented by means of binary registers and binary logic. Further, for each residue number X, a magnitude index Pxis maintained for all arithmetic operations. We investigate the properties of such a system and derive the addition, subtraction, multiplication, sign determination, and overflow detection algorithms. The proposed organization is found to improve the operation times for sign detection and overflow detection operations, while rendering multiplication to be a difficult operation."
"An upper bound is derived for the time required to add numbers modulo 2n, using circuit elements with a limited fan-in and unit delay, and assuming that all numbers have the usual binary encoding. The upper bound is within a factor (1 + ε) of Winograd's lower bound (which holds for all encodings), where ε→0 as n→∞, and only O(n log n) circuit elements are required."

"During the sixties we witnessed the fulfillment of the semiconductor prophecies of the fifties. Semiconductor technology stimulated, and at the same time united, the worlds of computing, communications, and control. Today in all three areas we find many cases where signal processing and transmission can be performed most economically by digital means. As we move into the seventies, the decade when the ballyhoo and promise of integrated circuits and LSI should become a reality, it is apparent that the pace of digitalization will quicken. To reap the rewards attendant to digital processing one must become familiar with the bridge between the worlds of the analoger and the digitaler. Hoeschle has provided a guide for the user or builder of this bridge and the toll ($12.95) is reasonable. At a minimum, it will help the user make a more intelligent choice from among the about 130 (as of the end of 1969) manufacturers of A to D or D to A converters. In addition, it should serve as a \"how to\" book for the designer of the relatively low-speed medium-accuracy type of converter. As the last word in the title implies, emphasis is placed on techniques rather than theory. Thus, the book is directed primarily at the hardware oriented engineering audience. Theoreticians used to dealing with quantization noise for random signals, optimum quantizers, and the like might find this book a useful vehicle for contacting the real world."
"The authors analyze the behavior of formulas for the numerical integration of ordinary differential equations by considering the frequency response of the \"integrators\" in the system being simulated. This approach will appeal to engineers, particularly those with an analog background, as being a familiar way to consider the departures from ideal performance of the \"computing elements\" used as building blocks in simulation. The method has the advantage that the quality of different formulas can be compared independently of any particular problem and irrespective of whether the problem is linear or nonlinear. It does not, of course, give directly the errors in the overall solution, merely the errors injected by the integrating components, but the necessary theory for deducing solution errors from component errors is available if needed."
"This paper is an interesting probabilistic study of the decomposability of sequential machines. State-splitting is not admitted, however. In view of the well known relationship between decompositions (of the state behavior) of sequential machines and partitions having the substitution property (SP partitions [1]), the author's interest turns to SP partitions."
"This paper concerns itself with rooted trees which have labeled nodes. The labels are taken from a stratified alphabet (each label is associated with a nonnegative number, the number of branches descending from it). The alphabet is divided into terminal and nonterminal labels. Tree generating grammars called regular systems are introduced. A set of trees serve as \"axioms\" and production rules of the form Φ→Ψ, where Φ and Φ are trees, allow successive replacement of subtrees Φ by Ψ. The \"language\" generated by such a system is the set of trees generable from the axioms containing terminal labels only. Such languages, when trees are written linearly (prefix or postfix form) are context free."
"Stochastic (or, indifferently, probabilistic) sequential machines have been recognized to be important mathematical models for several classes of information processing systems with memory, in which random disturbances cannot be neglected. As examples it suffices to mention the models of finite-state discrete channels for information transmission, sequential machines constructed from unreliable components, and adaptive learning systems. From a more abstract and less engineering-motivated angle, the stochastic sequential machine (SSM) represents the natural generalization of the deterministic one, on which a considerable body of knowledge exists. Not to be overlooked, finally, is the fact that the rich underlying structure promises elegant results and this undeniable aesthetic dimension certainly contributes an additional interest to this per se attractive topic."
"This paper is concerned with techniques for the synthesis of binary output synchronous sequential machines. In particular, the proposed techniques can be used to realize such a machine as an interconnection of a finite set of identical two-state component machines or modules. Furthermore, the module can be selected in advance since it depends only on the number of inputs and not on the structure of the machine to be realized."
"One of the problems in computer science is the gap between natural languages for human beings and programming languages for digital computers, since the former are much more complex than the latter. This is due to the fact that natural languages are fuzzy in nature but programming languages are precise. For example, when we say that a certain university is a good university, fuzziness arises since there is no sharp boundary between a good university and an average one. A university may be good from one person's point of view, but may be considered as just an average one in another person's opinion. To solve a problem by a computer, a great deal of time and energy would be saved if the computer could understand either natural languages themselves or something close to them. In other words, computers would become more powerful if they could accept fuzzy concepts similar to the capability of a human brain."

"The process of converting a mathematically defined curve into unit steps along a fixed axis in digital technique is known as interpolation. The representation of the curve may be parametric or nonparametric. The parametric representation is widely used since it lends itself to realization by ordinary DDA technique. However, the nonparametric representation is shown to be fully competitive. In many cases, e.g., circle generation, it seems to be advantageous because it eliminates the risk of curve degradation."
"The fastest parallel and pipeline computers presently being designed use interleaved memory systems with more than 16 individual memory units. A common difficulty in these machines is the alignment of data before it is arithmetically processed. Usually the arithmetic unit is used to preprocess the data. This may increase the computation time by a factor of two or more. This paper proposes a programmed memory preprocessing system which aligns the data before it is passed to the arithmetic processor."
"A bidirectional gate is described which would allow information contained in one register to be transferred to another register or vice versa. The rotate/shift functions may be implemented by gating the data between two flip-flop registers through the shifted or skewed gates connecting the two. The unique property of bidirectional transfer of data signals between two registers permits a simplified and interesting design of a rotate and shift circuit. The implementation of this rotate/shift circuit into a data processing configuration is also illustrated."
"Over ten years ago, Couleur described a serial binary/ decimal conversion algorithm, the BIDEC method. This was a two-step process involving a shift followed by a parallel modification of the data being converted. With the integrated-circuit J-K flip-flop, the implementation of this two-step process requires an excessive amount of control logic. This paper presents a one-step conversion algorithm that is suitable for binary-to-decimal and decimal-to-binary conversion. A general design procedure for formulating the conversion registers as a present-state/next-state counter problem is given, along with several examples of the application of the one-step algorithm. The advantages of this new algorithm include low cost, faster operation, and hardware modularity."
"In this paper the principles which are involved in designing an equipment for producing sequences of pseudorandom pulses, non-Poisson-distributed, are discussed. Design criteria are given and applications are discussed."
"The number of threshold functions of eight variables is counted by ILLIAC II, the computer of the University of Illinois. Sets of optimum weights of majority elements realizing these functions also are investigated. Actually, canonical positive self-dual threshold functions of nine variables are investigated instead of directly investigating threshold functions of eight variables because it is easier to deal with them. The number and optimum weights of threshold functions of eight variables are easily obtained from these functions of nine variables and their realization."
"In solving pattern classification problems, many researchers have successfully used the Fisher linear discriminant as the optimal linear method for discriminating between vector samples from two classes. With the introduction of on-line, interactive, graphic systems, it has become conveniently possible to extend the discrimination logic to piecewise linear methods. This paper describes such a method which is being used in the on-line pattern analysis and recognition system (OLPARS)."
"This note discusses a technique for representing linear bandpass systems in terms of a state-variable formulation (first-order matrix differential equation) involving complex-valued envelope functions. In narrow-band cases this yields a model involving more slowly varying quantities, and thus, less computing time is required for a given simulation task."
"The design of present-day logic systems, using circuits with transition times approaching 1 ns, meets with problems unless the transmission lines are properly terminated. It is very inconvenient to match the input and output of a logic circuit to the characteristic impedance of a transmission line, even at the cost of considerable distortion. An alternative method is to use lines of less than 5-cm length to reduce the distortion. However, many applications require longer lines, and some applications also require interconnecting logic circuits at various points along the line. This short note considers a method of dealing with this multiple problem using frequency domain, time domain, and experimental analysis."
"Faults can be circumvented in one-dimensional cellular arrays simply by switching out (bypassing) the defective cells in the cascade. In this note, the problem is solved of finding the minimal network of switches capable of bypassing up to q possibly defective cells from an n-celled array. The cells may be combinational or sequential, unilateral or bilateral, and may employ digital or continuous signals. It is shown that the minimum number N(n, q) of switches required equals ½(q+1)(2n-q+2) for the case when added internal circuit nodes are disallowed, or when q=1, and equals 3n otherwise."
"The problem of the length of a buffer store required for an Erlang input rate where words are removed at regular intervals is discussed. Analytical expressions relating buffer length to the loss resulting from overflow are derived. Graphical results are presented for a range of Erlang distributions."
"The Stein-Rose sorting algorithm for digital simulation is reexamined and reformulated in current terms. It is pointed out that the algorithm already contains within itself the means for the automatic detection of feedback loops (implicit outputs) in analog programs. The algorithm is then extended so that it can handle implicit outputs and the extended version is shown to be finite. Thus compilers for digital simulation languages utilizing the extended algorithm need not require that programmers take a priori action either to remove feedback loops from analog programs or to identify such loops to the compiler."
"An improvement in a method for recursive estimation of the mean of a random variable is suggested. The proposed algorithm is faster than conventional \"ideal\" averaging and only slightly less efficient, i.e., the estimate variance is only slightly larger for the same sample size."
"The matrix form of the Walsh functions as defined in the above-mentioned short note [1] can be generated by the modulo-2 product of two generating matrices: the natural binary code, and the transpose of the bit-reversed form of the first. As a result, the coefficients of the Walsh transform occur in bit-reversed order. By simply reordering the Walsh functions themselves to correspond to generation by the product of two such code matrices, neither or both in bit-reversed form, the Walsh coefficients occur in their natural order."

"Scheduling and resource allocation have come to the forefront of the problems that confront the designers of computer systems. This is particularly true in time-sharing, multiprogramming, and real-time systems, but it is also the case for somewhat less sophisticated systems due to problems created by disk accessing. Theory of Scheduling is a very readable treatment of some of the \"classical\" solutions to scheduling problems, as well as some heuristic ad hoc approaches that are suitable in particular computer environments. The operating systems designer should not consider this book as the panacea for all of his ills, however, because the methodology that is given for solving his scheduling problems may be unsatisfactory in the context in which he chooses to use it. For example, in a real-time system the scheduling algorithm must satisfy constraints on maximum computation time which are not necessarily satisfied by the algorithms described in the text."
"Scientific writing has long been adversely affected by the common misconception that \"objective\" and \"dull\" must be synonyms. That this is not the case Professor Arbib has once more proven by producing a sound and scientifically precise book that is also a pleasure to read. It will elicit more than just an occasional chuckle from its readers, and may even send some of them scurrying for their dictionaries with Greek polysyllables as \"prolegomenon,\" \"idiosyncratic,\" \"palindrome,\" \"polycephalic,\" and others; their search is doomed to failure with \"possibilistic,\" for the author has apparently coined this one himself. Sometimes it is difficult to separate his wit from misprints and misspellings as in \"... partial recursive with respect to one radix, they are partial recursive with respect to all radishes,\" granted, even, that \"radish\" comes from the same Latin word for \"root,\" \"radix.\" The flavor of the book is certainly unique. Can the reader think of any other book on automata theory closing with a phrase even remotely resembling \"That is why both nature and nurture are important\"?"
"In the last fifteen years many researchers working in such diverse areas as pattern recognition, parallel computation, self-reproducing automata, pattern recognition, evolution theory, information retrieval, and integrated circuit technology have found it convenient to use an array of identical intercommunicating finite-state machines as their underlying model. This naturally suggests that it would be worthwhile to develop a comprehensive theory of such arrays which would then provide a common framework for all these areas. Yamada and Amoroso have taken up this suggestion, and this paper is the first in a proposed series of papers reporting their results. However, as they readily admit, they have not attempted to produce a truly comprehensive model (an ill-defined, if not impossible, task), but rather they have been concerned with a \"fairly general\" model based largely on the earlier work of Moore."
"Let ∑ be a finite alphabet and ∑* the set of all finite words (sequences of symbols) over ∑. A fuzzy event f is a mapping from ∑* into [0, 1] and is called probabilistic if it is induced by a probabilistic automaton.1Some operations are defined on fuzzy events f, g, r: for x∈∑* (f ∨ g)(x) =Max (f(x), g(x)); (f ∧ g)(x)= min (f(x), g(x)); f(x)= 1-f(x); fT(x) =f(xT) where xT= σk⋯ σ1if x = σ1⋯ σk; [f, g:r](x)= f(x)r(x)+g(x)r̄(x), etc., and the closure of the events with regard to those operations are studied. Typical results: probabilistic events are closed under the bar operation, the bracket operation, and the \"T\" operation, but are not closed under the \"∨\" or \"∧\" operations (except for some restricted cases). Of particular interest is the result about the T-closure, as this problem has been open for a couple of years."
"The problem treated in this paper is that of realizing a Boolean function which is not linearly separable with a network of threshold gates. This problem has been treated by the tree method of Coates and Lewis [1], the geometric methods of Winder [5], and the algebraic methods of Hopcroft and Mattson [3] and Stabler [4] among others. In the above methods, the techniques become computationally impractical for a large number of variables and functions requiring several threshold gates. The method presented in this paper suffers from the same limitations, as well as from the fact that it is based entirely on necessary but not sufficient conditions for linear separability."
"The equivalence of the hierarchies of predicates or classes of sets is obtained. One hierarchy is given in terms of abstract machines, the other is defined in terms of the predicate calculus and involves formulas without quantifiers."
"A stationary maximin automaton is a system A = 〈S, U, f, h, F〉, where S and U are finite nonempty sets of states and inputs, respectively; F⊆S is a set of final states; f:S × U × S →[0, 1] can be imagined to be a transition relation which associates with every state s E S and input u E U a measure, 0≤ f(s,u,s') ≤ 1 that the next state is s', there being no constraint, for example, that the sum of these measures equals 1 for a given s and u. Similarly, the function h: S → [0, 1] defines something like an initial distribution, again with no constraints on the sum of all of the h(s)'s. What serves to distinguish maximin automata from other better known classes of automata is the manner in which the function f is extended to sequences of inputs x ∈ U*; this is defined as follows:"
"The author uses the Muller-Bartky asynchronous circuit theory to study the problem of designing circuits whose physical implementations operate correctly despite unpredictable signal delays in the wires connecting the elements."
"Applying some simple, easily understood principles, Spira, in extending some earlier work of Winograd, points the way to a powerful theory of computation complexity. Spira considers a (d, r) combinational network which is an interconnection of r-input, single-output modules, with each input-output line carrying a value from the set {0, 1, ⋯ , d -1}. A finite function φ: X1 × X2 × ⋯ Xn→Y is to be computed, but it is assumed that before the inputs are inserted into the network, each input can be individually (and arbitrarily) transformed by a set of maps gj: Xj→Ij. It is also assumed that there is a 1-1 output map h: Y→Oc, so in practice the (d, r) network will have as input [g1(x), ⋯, gn(xn)] and as output h(φ(x1, ⋯, xn)). The problem is to bound the number of levels required of the network. Given a φ for a particular output mapping, it is not difficult to specify a lower bound on the number of levels required, by identifying for each output line the number of different values of input variables which yield a different output value. The minimum number of levels required for each output line is then evaluated by noting that an output at level z can depend on at most r' input lines whence the output line requiring the most levels provides the bound."

"A digital control system has been developed for the precise control of speed of a commutatorless, electronically switched, parallel-armature-connected, variable-speed synchronous motor. The control system uses a fixed-frequency 400-Hz supply and permits the control of the machine velocity in steps of 1 r/ min from slewing rates up to at least 4000 r/ min in either direction, each selected speed being controlled to 1 part in 10<R>5</R> using a crystal oscillator reference. Programmed changes between preselected velocity limits can also be obtained in which the maximum rates of acceleration or deceleration may be preset manually, or may be adjusted automatically, so that the motor is always operated under the condition of maximum allowable leading or lagging torque angle. The motor system has achieved efficiences of over 80 percent for a 2-hp output at 2000 r/min; the only foreseeable horsepower rating limitation to this type of drive will be governed by the rating of the thyristors available for use as the main current control elements. The system has potential applications in the general area of high-performance independent and coordinated variable-speed drive systems for process industries."
"It is shown that a triangular perturbation signal provides increased position-detection accuracy over that provided by a sinusoidal perturbation signal [1]. Triangular perturbation is applied to a two-element photosensor receptor, resulting in perfect position detection within the dimensions of the receptor. It is also shown that perfect position detection can be obtained over as large a range as desired by using a many-element zero-deadband one-dimensional receptor subjected to triangular perturbation."
"The paper deals with a switching method ensuring continuity of the armature current. An optimization procedure is proposed for the commutation circuit components. Voltage and current waveform patterns are shown for all branches for the complete circuit, and means for improving the starting process are described."
"A high-frequency power bridge inverter is described with logic control circuitry to minimize switching transients. The logic circuitry corrects a major deficiency of bridge inverter circuits which can cause catastrophic failure."
"The majority of high-current dc power supplies for beam bending magnets have well known LCR low-pass ripple filters. To avoid prohibitive heat losses, the filter damping resistor is in series with the capacitor and not in the dc path. Such filters, when critically damped, attenuate high frequencies by 6 dB/octave. This paper analyzes an improved underdamped LCR filter which attenuates high frequencies by 12 dB/octave. Depending on the application, the improved filter can be designed to have an oscillatory or a non-oscillatory response to a step change of the input voltage. Design curves are given which show the frequency response and the time response to a unit step of a normalized improved filter for various degrees of damping."
"The requirements of a thyristor power amplifier for control purposes are examined, and the techniques for design of firing pulse circuitry to achieve linear input-output voltage transfer relationships are developed. The particular converter discussed has this linearity, inherent compensation for ac supply voltage variations, self-limiting firing circuits, and transition from constant voltage to constant current behavior at preset levels of either. Long pulse firing is used and the pulse duration adjusts itself automatically to meet any transient condition. Protection against over-voltage, over-current, regenerative load effects, and misfiring are included. The applications considered are in the tens of kilowatt rating range."

 "The Differential Pulse Width Modulation System presented here is a signal transduction scheme applicable to a wide range of data acquisition processes for either large systems such as industrial process control, aircraft flight testing, computerized medical information centers, etc. or individual users seeking low cost, compact measuring instruments. In this scheme, a variable capacitance or equivalent sensor, actuated by the physical quantities to be measured, is combined with an integrated circuit containing mainly logic elements, to generate a series of pulses with fixed height in voltage but varying width in time so that the difference/sum ratio of the width between two adjacent pulses is proportional to the input. Signals thus modulated can be converted readily into analog output by simple low-pass filtering and can also control a simple up-down counter to give digital output, bypassing the conventional analog-digital converter. For portable recording, this differential pulse width scheme facilitates the use of inexpensive tape recorders at no sacrifice in accuracy, since there is no need for precision speed control."
"This is a companion paper serving as an extension of an earlier presentation entitled ``Signal Transduction With Differential Pulse Width Modulation''1. In that paper, a scheme was introduced to streamline the data acquisition system bridging a variety of physical parameters to be measured with several forms of signal processing. The essential part of that scheme involves the generation of a differential pulse width modulated signal with integrated logic circuits utilizing d. c. excitation to produce analog output with significant power, a pulse width modulated signal suitable for transmission or tape recording, or a digital output suitable for computer coupling."
"When telemetering scientific data it is frequently desirable to improve the quality of the received data. This can be accomplished by improving either the transducer or the communication link or both. In practice, one would improve that unit for which the payoff is the greatest. Therefore, a study of the information content of the signal process which is lost to the transducer was conducted. This paper presents a method for determining the loss of information in first order transducers. Input signals to the transducers are sample functions from the Stationary Gaussian Markoff (SGM) process. Transducers considered are those which can be modeled by the four resistance, capacitance circuit equivalents: low pass, high pass, integrator and differentiator networks. Mean Integral Square Error (MISER) is used as a goodness measuring criterion."
"This paper describes a new concept in combustion chamber diagnostic systems. The sensor used by this concept is unique because it can be conveniently used to probe activity occurring within the combustion chamber of internal combustion engines, during high speed operation and at maximum loading. Sensing takes place through a spark plug port without interfering with normal ignition process and without modification to the engine. The sensing means is one that utilizes microwave absorptions of radiated energy, which occur as the piston moves up and down within the cylindrical combustion chamber. These absorptions provide information concerning among other parameters, (a) top dead center (via a BDC reference mark), (b) rate of chemical ionization, (c) direction and rate of instantaneous piston motion (d) ignition, and (e) engine operating efficiency. The system has undergone tests using utility single cylinder engines, six cylinder and V-8 automobile engines. Microwave resonances in the X-band and also the C-band have been used to examine the cylinder bore. Illustrations are provided describing typical microwave field configurations employed by the concept and also the time character of the resonances that occur throughout the combustion cycle. References are supplied which deal with the subject of ionization in flames and also the interaction of ions with microwave fields."
"A new shape meter principle is described, which indicates the quality of flatness of cold rolled strip in the course of rolling. This meter measures elongation e of instantaneous waveform of the strip on the line. Value e of a wavy edge was measured during rolling, at the outlet of the last stand of a five stand tandem cold mill, with the shape meter. Elongation ezof wavy edge under free tension was measured with another new instrument. Then correlation coefficient r between e and ezwas calculated. As a result, in the range of 5x 10-4ez1x10-3, r=0.979 was obtained. The value of Detectivity emin=5x10-4was obtained at 10kg/mm2strip tension."
"Most torque measuring transducers develop an electrical output signal proportional to the twisting of an accurately machined and calibrated seciton of shaft known as a torque bar, Fig. 1."
"The operation of several electrostatic devices depends upon the electrostatic forces which tend to hold together a metal member and a closely adjacent semiconducting member when a voltage is applied between them. In this paper it is shown that if the semiconducting member is replaced by a dielectric member and particularly by a piezoelectric member, electrostatic forces may be generated at low applied voltages and exploited for the construction of low voltage clutches or similar electrostatic devices."
"This paper describes the results of combined neutron and gamma ray irradiation tests conducted on two makes of piezoresistive accelerometers. Units were irradiated to total neutron doses of 7 X 1013, 5 X 1014, and 5 X 1015neutrons̷cm2. One make, Bytrex, Inc. Model AV 1000, operated satisfactorily at all doses."
"A two component piezoelectric skin-friction force transducer has been developed for a hypersonic flow tunnel which has a run time of approximately 70 milliseconds. Skin-friction forces acting on a sensing diaphragm are transferred to a transducer element which is constructed of lead zirconate titanate composition ceramic beams. The transducer converts a force into two charge signals which correspond to orthogonal components of the force parallel to the skin-friction force sensing diaphragm. The diameter of the sensing element is 0.940 inch and the overall transducer dimensions are 1 inch diameter and 0.625 inch high."
"A new lightweight operator's head telephone set is briefly described. The headset which weighs about 1/2 ounce is entirely supported by a custom-fitted molded plastic ear piece worn by the user. Contained in the headset are two small, electroacoustic transducers -- one for receiving and one for transmitting. The receiver delivers an acoustic signal into the user's ear canal through an ear insert. The transmitter is acoustically coupled to the user's lips by a speech tube and drives an amplifier which provides a proper voltage level for all Bell System applications of interest. Both transducers are variable reluctance, concentric pole designs."
"Commercial pressurized water reactors designed by Westinghouse NES employ neutron and temperature sensors extensively for neutron flux and temperature measurements in the reactor cores. These are for use in monitoring, control and protection of the reactor with some being located actually within the core and others external to the reactor vessel."
"A new variable capacitance temperature transducer can be used to measure temperatures within a few millidegrees in predetermined ranges from 0° to 1200° or 1300°K. Originally developed to measure temperatures of cryogens to accuracies not possible with existing devices, it operates on the principle of large changes in pressure-volume relationship of gases and gas mixtures as a function of temperature in the range to be measured. Opposing variable capacitors and electrical readout eliminate errors and avoid inherent problems caused by capillary tubes or mechanical devices."
"Pressure recording is frequently performed with catheter-manometer systems having high frequency response but inadequate damping. Resonance amplification of catheter movement artefact is often a problem with underdamped systems. The amount of amplitude amplification at the resonant frequency of a water-filled catheter and transducer is a function of the damping of the system."
"Two types of thin pressure transducers have been designed and fabricated for prosthetic application. Using a transducer less than 0.015 inch thick, it is felt that the pressure distribution between the stump of a leg amputee and the socket of the prosthesis will not be altered significantly."
"A major unfilfilled health-care need is a means of obtaining specific data from within the body on a long-term basis. Preventable deaths and avoidable medical catastrophies frequently occur due to lack of obtainable physiological data. Suitable implantable data-collecting and transmitting systems appear to be within the technological state of the art. An urgent need exists for national standardization on one or a few compatible systems to facilitate concerted research and commercial development. One such candidate system and the requirements it imposes on transducer development is described. A related alternative system, possibly more suitable for self-use by non-hospitalized persons, is outlined."
"Definitive criteria for the selection of polymers to be used with implanted biomedical electronic devices are not generally available. Critical aspects, such as corrosion, fatigue, instability, irritability to tissues, and thrombogenicity of component materials, force the designer to draw primarily upon empirical in vivo experience. Nevertheless, the judicious selection of polymers, with regard to properties and optimum methods of handling, is crucial to satisfactory performance at or within the boundaries of the living organism."
"Biological sensors intended for clinical use can have requirements which are quite different from those normally associated with biological research. In fact the requirements can be surprisingly severe when involved with the diagnosis and/or treatment of the seriously ill. Such requirements, if not realized and fully understood at the beginning of development, can greatly increase the time and cost of development and can endanger the acceptance of a new instrument by the medical fraternity. I shall discuss some of these special requirements and consequent developing problems. I have chosen to limit my considerations to cardiovascular sensors partly because of time limitations and partly because they do afford succinct examples of problems involved with seriously ill patients."
"Ultrasound has been widely investigated as a form of radiant energy for bio-medical applications. Both diagnostic and therapeutic techniques have been proposed and studied. Perhaps the greatest effort has been directed toward the development of techniques for imaging internal tissue structures for medical diagnostic purposes. All such techniques are dependent upon both transmitting and receiving transducers for radiating and detecting the ultrasound energy. Indeed, in most of the pulse-echo ultrasound imaging that has been accomplished, the transducer characteristics have been the limiting factor in determining the image resolution and dynamic range that can be achieved. The nature of these limitations and some possibilities for reducing or overcoming them will be discussed."
"The use of photovoltaic diodes as logarithmic detectors has been investigated. An analysis of the response of the diode shows that the dynamic range of the device decreases with increased loading. Experimental measurements on diffused GaAs diodes, which have threshold sensitivities in the 1-10 nW/cm2range, confirmed this analysis."
"When used as an integral part of a process system, a metering pump must be made responsive to a process variable. When the process variable is flow, measuring devices producing pulse outputs can be utilized to make a metering pump respond to the flow variation. A diaphragm or packed plunger metering pump is composed of a motor, a gearbox and a liquid displacement mechanism. Changes in the pump displacement can be accomplished by use of appropriate interface devices between the pulse transmitter and the pump."
"An analysis of inductive probes consisting of wire loops without and with compensation elements is presented. With a compensation spur, such a probe may serve as a sensor for the magnetic field intensity in electromagnetic fields. Probe structures, equivalent circuits, probe characteristics, and various models for measurements up to 35 GHz are shown."
"The shading coil displacement transducer is unique among the family of variable inductance displacement transducers in that no motion of an iron core is necessary. The moving element is a small, one-turn winding which functions as a shading coil. This means that this device is characterized by an extremely light armature."
"The need for reliable, easily applied, dry electrodes for use in medical applications has prompted investigation in many directions. Most wet or paste type electrodes are not only irritating to the skin when used over long periods of time, but also require careful skin preparation for clinically useful results. An insulated electrode technique has been reported which requires no skin preparation and is immune to artifacts induced by electrode polarization. This electrode consists of an anodized metal disc which relies upon capacitive coupling with the skin to derive its electrical signal. The signal output of the electrode is coupled directly into an FET source follower which has an output impedance of 5000 ohms, and is coupled into standard clinical recording equipment. This paper reports further improvements in the development of electrodes of this type."
"An important parameter to be measured in the physiological study of living tissue is the amount of dissolved oxygen. These pO2measurements, for the most part, are made by periodically withdrawing specimens of body fluids and performing the measurement on the exogenous sample. This technique, while highly accurate for the particular specimens, has severe limitations in that only periodic samples can be made and the results of the measurement are not immediately available. Continuous measurement of pO2would provide a great contribution to our understanding of physiological processes, as well as allow for ``on line'' monitoring of critically ill patients."

"A nonlinear, active network that transforms the voltage waveform of a unipolar source of energy is presented. This network consists of ideally lossless elements such as inductors, capacitors, and on-off switches. Control is obtained by variation of the mode of switch operation. A circuit philosophy is applied which is adapted to the characteristics of switch operation and confines the stresses imposed on circuit components to moderate levels. Results of experimental work are reported and include: 1) test data of a 95 percent efficient, 2-kW dc transformer having a power density of 0.4 kW/kg; and 2) integration of this transformer with a 20-cm ion propulsion engine for spacecraft."
"Toroidal magnetic cores are used for noncontacting alternating current-sensing in applications such as circuit breakers and ground fault interrupters. In such applications, it is often desirable to maximize the voltage induced in the sense coil on the core. In order to maximize this voltage with respect to the sensed current, core design parameters are developed for 60- and 400-Hz applications. The effects of core material, core size, temperature, frequency, and winding are analytically determined and experimentally verified."
"Most papers on optimal control are too theoretical to assist the professional engineer controlling an industrial plant. This paper is intended for such engineers. It shows that in practical industrial situations wherein complete instrumentation of the plant is impractical, Pontryagin's method is often best for obtaining optimal control."
"Two-transistor pulsewidth modulated converters do not find widespread application since they are usually expensive, bulky, and difficult to design. To resolve these difficulties, a circuit is presented in which the pulsewidth control mechanism is separate from the power-handling stages. This permits the use of a standard integrated digital control module, which simplifies the overall design of two-transistor pulsewidth modulated converters. The module is small and inexpensive, and results in efficient, high-performance converters."

 "Initially, only the military had stressed and specified levels of reliable performance for semiconductor devices. Now, even by many of today's commercial operating requirements, the early military standards are obsolete and unreal. Many times reliability is unspecified, but expected, and for these instances product qualification plays an important role. In relating rectifier type products and applications to reliability, this paper will summarize the latest preferred methods of conformation of same (life testing etc.), the various industry and military documents that can be of aid when determining what level of reliability is required, and what the confirmation of same can mean financially."
"Any switch handling inductive loads must, at some time or another, dissipate the energy stored in the inductance. In the case of a knife switch, this energy can be both seen and heard as an electric spark. In the case of a transistor, this energy is dissipated as heat and the resultant junction temperature rise can lead to catastrophic failure within the device.1The failure mechanism is referred to as ``reverse-biased second breakdown'', hereinafter termed RBSB."
"With the advent of new solid state techniques it becomes feasible to design special purpose preprogrammed digital computers. One application for such a device is in the area of industrial process control. The trend in the field is toward computer control of all industrial processes. To have a single central computer control hundreds of continuous processes in a single plant could be a problem of insurmountable proportions if all problems such as computer failure, subsystem failures, etc. were to be accounted for."
"The theory concerning the use of fast-time simulation to realize a near-ideal predictor for sampled control systems is discussed, and an evaluation is presented of its use as a method of compensation. A comparison is made between near-ideal predictive compensation and conventional compensation. When the approaches are combined they form a new and versatile approach to compensation."
"In recent years the Process Control Industry has opened new avenues for the application of digital computers. Processing capability of third generation machines makes it possible to apply these computers to a large number of control applications. The vast differences in magnitude between process variable time constants and computer processing rates has allowed the digital computer to enter an area previously reserved for the analog computer."
"A batch process control system built around a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP8L minicomputer is described both in hardware and software. This system allows two levels of operator interaction with the normally automatic production of any of a wide family of chemical products. The wide variety of functions performed by this system range from simple alarm-point monitoring and process logging to on-line closed-loop control."
"The Bailey Meter Company has developed a pressure transmitter which incorporates a solid state sensing element. Pressure across the sensing element, a single crystal silicon wafer, strains a resistor diffused into the silicon by solid state techniques. Due to the piezoresistance effects, the diffused resistor changes value linearly with induced strain. The ohmic change of the piezoresistor is converted directly into millivolts, amplified and converted into a 4 to 20 ma DC output signal which varies linearly with pressure. The transmitter is a true, two-wire system as both excitation power for the transmitter and output signal transmission are accomplished using the same pair of conductors."
"This paper describes a new pulse tachometer system which combines the environmental virtues of the reluctance pickup with an independence from speed generally associated with more complex and fragile types. The mechanical properties of the sensing head permit considerable freedom in the manner of its installation; in the application described it is mounted in the end-bell of a self-ventilated traction motor. Electrically, the system can produce pulse rates from zero to at least seven kilo-hertz with a purely digital (square wave) output, can tolerate fairly long cable connections between the remote sensing head and the electronics, and is compatible with digital control schemes."
"This paper describes the basic principles of operation and control of three closely related types of static thyristor inverter circuit, which have been developed specifically for induction heating applications. The circuits described constitute a complete and compatible line of static frequency converters, capable of meeting the needs of virtually all practical induction heating applications, requiring frequencies from 180 Hz up to 10 kHz, at power levels from 100 kW upwards."
"Static power supplies, incorporating solid state switching devices, are rapidly becoming commonplace in the induction heating industry. Several different system approaches have been described in the literature (see Bibliography) from both the design and application viewpoint. The present paper covers a functionally similar system, but one which incorporates circuitry different from that previously described. This approach is intended for use in the 1 to 3 KHz range. At lower frequencies, the economics of other systems are more favorable whereas at higher frequencies currently available SCR switching speeds are inadequate."
 "Solid state equipment featuring thyristors offer the finest power control available today for induction heating and melting applications. Greater reliability is a foregone conclusion, higher efficiencies are commonplace, and faster speed of response, as well as closer control, are part of the thyristor features. This paper describes what a static converter is, how it works, and how it compares with its familiar counterpart, the motor generator."
"Co-ordination of semiconductors and high speed fuses with respect to surge ratings has been a relatively simple matter because of ample safety factors present in the published data. This has resulted in considerable difficulty in obtaining full semiconductor utilization, because the fuses so chosen tend to limit the maximum continuous semiconductor current. Since the semiconductor industry trend is towards higher continuous current ratings with the same published surge ratings, a closer evaluation of all aspects relating to fuse and semiconductor surge ratings is necessary to permit full use of the semiconductor's maximum continuous current."
"This paper describes a PWM Static Inverter as used in Uninterruptible Power Systems having transfer times of 1/4 cycle or less. Such performance is extremely important in critical AC power applications for on-line process controls and computers where longer duration outages would result in very costly and extensive down time. A static switching bypass system is outlined, a comparison of inverter types is given and the compatibility and performance advantages of the PWM Static Inverter as used in this bypass system are presented."
"Recent advances in thyristor and fuse technologys have made possible new equipment which can subject thyristors to faults currents beyond present ratings. Power sources are now available which can deliver fast rising fault currents to levels above the thyristor surge ratings; fuses can clear such high faults - all within less than one millisecond. This paper will cover test results and work being done by the author, as a member of the JEDEC JS-14 Committee, to establish a non-repetitive peak current registration format and testing procedures for durations down to 0.5 milliseconds."
"Technological developments come upon us so rapidly these days that it is absolutely impossible to stay well informed. And to compound the problem, many of the new technologies receiving press coverage are not yet available in product form. They are academically interesting, but cannot be used today. This talk is intended to increase your awareness of recent new product developments in the area of circuit modules. The emphasis will be on modules designed for use in instrumentation and control systems. These modules are all presently available as catalog items, all are under $100 in cost, and all represent some significant performance/price breakthroughs."

"Photodiodes and photo transistors are presently being applied to many fields to convert optical signals into electrical signals. One application of these devices is in a position detection system. The accuracy of such a system is limited by nonlinearities due to these devices. Through signal perturbation, a method in which an extra signal of higher frequency is added to the input of the receptor, the nonlinearities can be altered and the accuracy improved. The theory for this technique is well understood; however, very little experimental data have been reported. This method has been experimentally tested and the results have been compared with those predicted by the theory."
"The time optimal performance of bang-bang control systems can be achieved by properly timing the relay operations, two switchings being required for the optimal response of third-order systems. The movement of the state point is observed in the two-dimensional projections of the phase space. If the first switching is delayed after the state point has crossed the optimum curves in both planes, the second switching occurs at the optimum switching boundary. The coordinate axis and the optimum boundary divide the phase space into sections described by logic variables, from which the controller has been developed. A function generator determines the projections of the optimum switching curve, and a delay circuit is designed to delay the first switching operation."
"The requirements governing the choice of a fully automated data handling system for the Environmental Testing Division of the European Space Research Organization (ESRO) are indicated. Consideration is given to the wide range of experimenter needs, the operational requirements, and the geographic location of the laboratory."

This new starting circuit over-comes a number of shortcomings and disadvantages of previously used single-and multiple-pulse circuits. Analysis and design of the circuit is presented, as well as a description of its application in an ac-to-dc power supply."
"This paper treats the problem of obtaining the switching curve in designing time-optimal controllers for processes containing a time delay. This method differs from previous approaches in that it eliminates the need for solving differential difference equations. A synthesis procedure is outlined. An example is worked which points out the simplicity of the method. Several initial states are considered which show the regions of optimal control and those of suboptimal control."
"This review paper concerns the state of the art in the field of semiconductor sensors based on thermoresistive effect. After an introduction to the physical principles on which these devices work, a thorough survey is made of the characteristics and applications. Finally, a critical appraisal of the situation is presented, together with some possible trends."
"This paper presents a survey of the recent developments of piezoresistive sensors. First, the physical concepts which are essential for the understanding of these devices are recalled, and the characteristics and limitations (particularly temperature limitations) of semiconductor strain gauges are discussed. A further section is devoted to strain-gauge pressure transducers (the most important application of strain gauges), and, finally, possible future developments are outlined."
"A random perturbation about the true position of a target image is shown to improve the position-detection accuracy of systems which operate on quantized data. For a two-sensor receptor the random perturbation is shown to decrease the position error measurably. For a multisensor receptor the random perturbation is shown to drive the position error to zero."

"This standard pertains to computer-type pulse transformers. These pulse transformers are characterized by their use of a square loop core material as defined below with normal operation into the saturation flux density regions and with typical operation using a specifically defined current input pulse. These transformers exploit the memory characteristic of square-loop core material that makes the output pulse dependent upon the immediate history of the core flux. This type of transformer is used in shift registers, memory across switches, memory readout circuits, transformer logic matrices, and other storage-type devices. It is not the purpose of this standard to include large-scale memories. Wherever numerical requirements are indicated, they may be considered as recommended values. Appendix I contains a core analysis, transformer equivalent circuit, and definitions of associated terms. Appendix II contains definitions pertaining mainly to characteristic testing of computer-type pulse transformers."
"This publication presents standard test procedures for Geiger-Muller counter radiation detectors.

"In seismic data processing various methods of gain control are used in recording the data and to subsequently bring the events in the record up to a nearly uniform level. In carrying out deconvolution, an essential step is estimating the reverberation operator, or, equivalently, its autocorrelation function, from the data. The choice of gain function not only affects the appearance of the data but the reliability of the estimate of the correlation function of the reverberation operator. This paper investigates what choice of gain function yields the most reliable estimate, measured in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio in the estimate. The result, not suprisingly, is that the most reliable estimate is obtained by the gain function which brings the mean-square event strength up to a uniform level. However, this result is true only when certain assumptions are made. The purpose of this paper is to give a rational basis for this intuitively plausible result and to carefully delineate the circumstances under which it is true."
"The electrical behavior of rocks exhibits a marked frequency dependence which has been difficult to interpret on a macroscopic scale except with resort to \"abnormal\" behavior. An important aspect of the interpretation of measurements is in the connection of measured quantities to the defined electrical parameters. This study utilizes a linear system analogy for a material having conductivity and permittivity which vary with frequency to show that 1) the electrical parameters for such a material must generally be considered complex functions of frequency, 2) that measurements yield only combinations of these parameters and, 3) that the complex formulation predicts, in a qualitative sense, the measured results."
"This work describes an accurate pulse radar altimeter which is simple and light enough to be carried aloft by a regular sounding balloon. The altimeter uses a single superregenerative stage serving as both the receiver and the transmitter. This stage is used in a feedback system in such a way that the period between transmitted pulses is a measure of altitude. The relatively slow rate of change of altitude allows the averaging of many returns with corresponding improvement in signal-to-noise ratio. Accurate geometric altitude of a meteorological balloon can improve atmospheric sounding. It can also replace either temperature or pressure measurements through the use of the hydrostatic equation. Geometric altitude is essential in floating superpressure balloons, where, together with a pressure measurement, it yields the necessary reference pressure. Analysis of the altimeter and details of the instrumentation are given, along with results of flight tests. Altitudes up to 20 km were measured in balloon flight tests over Lake Michigan. At midrange, the rms value of the random error was smaller than 0.07 percent. Height readings were available every 2 seconds during both the ascent and descent of the balloon payload. The peak power of the altimeter was one watt."
"The delay-locked loop, with its applications to radar, sonar, seismic propagation studies and interferometry, is a basic geoscience instrument. This paper presents the theory and investigates the performance of the delay-locked loop with and without clipping in a noisy (Gaussian) environment. The signal processing required to produce an appropriate error characteristic is derived and the significant factors affecting system operation are presented in the form of a normalized model. When signal clipping is introduced, a delay tracking system is shown to result that is self-adjusting and capable of providing near optimum performance in varying signal/ noise environments. Application is made to the tracking of a research submersible randomly exploring the ocean floor. The dual problem of continuously tracking the peak spectral frequency of a random process exhibiting a slowly changing resonance is also considered."
"The response characteristics of a galvanometer amplifier having an inductive source impedance and employing negative feedback may be determined easily and quickly by means of log-magnitude techniques. Galvanometer amplifiers for geomagnetic micropulsation detection systems are analysed, and the effects of series and of parallel feedback are considered. It is shown that by varying the nature and the amount of feedback a variety of frequency response curves may be obtained from a given detector coil and galvanometer. A practical series feedback amplifier operating from an iron-cored detector coil and having an amplitude response following an approximate dH/dt law to 2 Hz with an output of 100 mV/ϒH is described."
"Instrumentation has been designed, developed, calibrated, and installed for recording temperature profiles and flow rates at several points in Cayuga Lake in the vicinity of a fossil-fueled power plant. Four buoys and one rigid pole in the lake are used for the instrument installations and are connected to shore via coaxial cable. The temperature and flow rate data are transmitted over the cable by audio tones frequency modulated by the variable being measured. The cable also carries power for the instruments and low frequency command signals for sampling various instruments at the buoys and the pole. Time division multiplex is used for sampling of up to 24 signals from each of the buoys and the pole and to permit transmission of the data via the one coaxial cable. At the shore, the data can be extracted and recorded in digital or analog format. The output of a digital-to-analog converter deflects a paper chart recorder for monitoring purposes. The sampled signals are connected to a Bell Telephone voice quality line to permit remote access to the data, a useful feature for equipment maintenance."
"Certain air pollutants from combustion and others derived via complex photochemical reactions of the primary pollutants in the atmosphere are toxic to vegetation. This paper presents a discussion of these pollutants and their effects on plants. Chemical methods currently employed to measure the occurrence of these pollutants frequently lack sensitivity and specificity to determine accurately the compounds involved. The use of vegetation as well as chemical analysis to monitor air pollutants, however, provide powerful tools for measuring the complex composition of the atmosphere. New and improved analytical techniques suitable for detailed analysis of low levels of impurities present in the atmosphere need to be developed for use both in the laboratory and in the field. In monitoring, the atmosphere chemical methods record the concentration of specific pollutants while the phytological methods measure the total impact of pollutants on plant life."

 "The requirements for global data acquisition systems stem primarily from the use of computers in general forecasting and their acceptance of only quantitative information. During the early part of the 1970's, automation of the basic surface observation is seen as a major trend. The development of compatible sensor systems to eliminate human subjectivity is identified as an important problem area. Use of navigational aids (Loran-C/Omega) will be made in obtaining upper atmospheric data to heights of 30 km. During the mid and late 1970's, remote sensing from satellites will provide temperature profies of the atmosphere on an operational basis for the entire globe. By the end of the decade, surface based indirect sensors will be in use for near surface (up to 10 km) measurements of temperature and moisture. The development of these systems and their employment depend in large measure on the capabilities of the electronics industry."
"The problem of air pollution, particularly in metropolitan areas, is a function of widely distributed sources of contaminants and meteorological conditions which prevail over a large geographical area. To effectively monitor such a large area, and to provide timely, accurate information at a reasonable cost, an automated data network was deemed mandatory. The initial system for monitoring, telemetering, and assembling air-quality data in New York City is composed of ten diverse monitoring locations, each containing instrumentation for the measurement of CO, SO2, particulates, temperature, wind speed, and wind direction. The central, or control point of the network, is at Air Pollution Control Department offices in downtown Manhattan. Display equipment, output devices, controls for the network, and the automatic equipment, including a small-scale integral computer, form the network master station. The system, as now installed, can accommodate up to 30 remote telemetry stations with up to 12 instruments at each location. Plans for extension of the system are now under consideration and include mobile field laboratories using radio telemetry and additional fixed locations."
"The radar data system at the National Severe Storms Laboratory presents weather radar return power data with a significant reduction in the variations that arise from the relative motion of discrete precipitation elements. The system provides intensity-contoured plan position indicator (PPI) displays for visual inspection and photographic archival, and digital records in azimuth-range coordinates for use in computers and for narrow-band transmission to remote locations. Digital records can also be reproduced in the PPI format. The spatial distribution of echo power perceived during each two degrees of antenna azimuthal revolution, is represented as ten levels of return power intensity at intervals of 2°×1 nmi. Spatial reticulation is of the same order as limits of resolution inherent in the radar beamwidth and pulse length, and the system output thus retains most of the information on precipitation rate distributions contained in the unprocessed video signals. Averaging over two pulse lengths and the equivalence of ten pulse periods provides approximately Gaussian-distributed estimates of mean intensity with a standard error of 1 dB, less than one-fifth of the uncertainty of point-sampled unprocessed video. The system is used routinely at NSSL with a 10-cm WSR-57 radar, a type widely used by the Weather Bureau, and could be adapted to any weather radar system."
"This paper describes a maintenance reporting system in use in the Weather Bureau. The factors that must be determined for a successful reporting system are to establish goals, to be able to measure performance against goals, and to provide data for improving operating procedures. Examples of the use of the reporting system data to assist in optimizing the maintenance program are given, including the design of next generation hardware. The reporting forms used in the system and their functions are discussed. The described reporting system has successfully integrated equipment failure reporting and reports concerning the distribution of electronics technician time. Of specific importance is the use of time-shared computers to extract information at all levels of the organization and the low overall cost of the reporting system."
"Because of the ever-changing nature of the phenomena with which it deals, operational meteorology requires an efficient communications system. This requirement transcends national boundaries and has given rise to international, as well as national, telecommunication systems. The facilities available at present in the United States to meet these needs are outlined. In particular the automated center operated by the Environmental Science Services Administration, Weather Bureau, at the Washington World Meteorological Center is described. Present communications technology is capable of bearing the tremendous volume of meteorological data available throughout the world today. However, modem equipment is not universally in use and the cost of acquisition and operation of communication systems available at present is prohibitive on the scale required. The increased need for data from remote areas, such as the oceans, will add significantly to the communications burden. As a result, new approaches are being explored. Several of these possible improvements are briefly noted."
"Measurements of the ground wave field intensity were made along radial paths from a low-frequency transmitter in Rapid City, S. Dak. Ground wave attenuation curves for different conductivities are compared with the measured data. Millington's mixed path theory for path segments with different conductivities is then applied to obtain a ground conductivity map. Effects of topological features such as hills, ridges, and rivers, and variations in ground moisture and temperature are discussed. Hills and ridges are described along each radial path for the purpose of indicating the influence of terrain irregularities. The conductivity variations have an impact on radio station coverage which is described for a low-frequency range station."

 "An experimental study of the behavior of sanitary landfills is reported. Two facilities are described: a simulated land-fill operated under laboratory conditions and a field landfill operated under natural environmental conditions. This paper emphasizes environmental control and temperature monitoring, although the complete study includes evaluation of liquid and gas pollutant generation. The simulated landfill is a laboratory lysimeter 6 feet square and 13 feet high. Temperature and precipitation controls are provided. Of particular concern is the minimization of heat flow through the tank's vertical walls, both in and out, due to temperature differentials between the refuse and the laboratory. The field facility is operated under natural environmental conditions. While the project is incomplete, the results of the temperature study indicate that refuse temperatures can exceed 150°F if the refuse remains aerobic. Once anaerobic, refuse temperatures are relatively constant and virtually independent of atmospheric temperature changes. It is concluded that, while temperatures can indicate the existence of an aerobic or anaerobic state in the refuse, they are not indicators of the expended landfill life. A summary of lysimeter gas and leachate data is presented."
"Management games are an application of the technique of simulation that affords the player experience in decision-making situations and substitutes gaming in a simulated environment for involvement in a real one. DISCUS is a management game that illustrates the application of gaming techniques to solid-waste management. The object of the game is for the player to establish transfer stations, incinerators, and sanitary landfills throughout a hypothetical region, and to make other assignments such that the collection, haul, and processing costs of the waste to be collected and disposed of are minimized."
"Environmental noise is widely noted as a form of \"pollution.\" Measurement of noise intensity as a function of frequency is essential to its understanding and control. This is a tutorial paper summarizing standard current techniques and precautions to be followed in measuring environmental noise."
"Recalcitrant pollutants, such as pesticides, plastics, and ligninsulfonates, a product of paper manufacture, are of increasing concern because microorganisms are not able to break these down at desirable rates. With insufficient rates of breakdown, one can observe increasing accumulation of these materials in the environment. To aid microorganisms in metabolizing such materials, photolytic processes have been developed that show the potential of treating process streams, allowing more efficient microbial utilization. These systems can be envisioned for production of microbial protein and for the pretreatment of materials before release into natural environments. Photolysis efficiency is dependent on the wavelength of light used, with light in the ultraviolet range, from 180 to 210 nm being most effective. An active free-radical reacting reagent, such as oxygen, is required for efficient modification. After modification a substrate can be used in growth chambers for production of microbial protein or be treated in a lagoon system before release to a natural environment. Aspects of control and instrumentation, which should be considered in future large-scale use of such processes, are discussed."
"A new family of air-pollution monitoring instruments is described in general terms. These new instruments are compared with conventional instrunents in terms of their respective functional capabilities. Representative examples of the new family of instruments, now in various stages of development, are described individually. Included are devices for the continuous unattended measurement of sulfur dioxide, ozone, nitric oxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Design concepts that made the above improvements possible are discussed in a search for means by which they may be extended to yield future instruments that will constitute even greater advances. Needed are transducers that will respond directly to environmentalcompositional changes reversibly and in a quasi-specific manner. Several examples are given to illustrate ways in which such devices could be applied to air-pollution monitoring."
"This paper considers the techniques of correlation spectroscopy as applied to the remote sensing of air-polluting gases SO2 and NO2. The occurrence of molecular absorption of solar and artificial electromagnetic radiation is used to determine the quantitative value of the gases over a long-line length. The paper will consider the instrument principles of operation, applications of a portable remote sensing system, and results for the long-line determinations of S02 and NO2 quantities. The system and application techniques presented here are in consideration of inimizing distorting and interfering factors that are inherently present in solar radiation. The remote sensing long-line system that is portable is significant to air-pollution monitoring, because it adds accurate quantitative dimension to the usual point sampling methods of measurement."
"The method of measuring small concentrations of pollutant gases utilizing sealed electrochemical sensors has many advantages over the conventional methods. The development of specific electrochemical sensors for the detection of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen at temperatures to 80°C warranted further research into improved organic electrolyte systems. A useful technique for evaluating a number of electrolyte systems is the sweep voltammetric characterization. Dissolved pollutant gases are activated and electrooxidized or electroreduced by changing the potential on a sensing electrode. The data can be rapidly collected and are adequate to give information pertaining to reaction potentials and the resultant current, possible interfering gases, and electrolyte stability. Tests of assembled pollution sensors utilizing electrolytes selected by sweep voltammetric techniques have verified the usefulness of the method."
"Two related systems have been developed for measuring horizontal and vertical temperature structure in the ocean. One system must be suspended from a ship, with power supplied through the coaxial support cable. The other system is powered by internal batteries and records data in situ with an incremental tape recorder. This system is suspended from a tuned spar buoy, which removes most of the wave-generated vertical motion from the sensors."
"Two methods for the iterative synthesis of an array processor are discussed: the method of steepest descent and the method of conjugate gradients with projection. These methods require no intermediate statistics such as the covariance matrix function or the cross-power spectral matrix, and therefore, require less storage space than the conventional synthesis methods. A bound for the rate of convergence is obtained for these iterative procedures and it is shown that the convergence is geometric. The algorithms are then applied to seismic data of the Montana large aperture seismic array. Simulation results indicate that the convergence is so fast that a few iterations are enough from the practical viewpoint. Therefore, these methods can also save significant computation time as well."
"Two methods for measuring network lengths and areas by automatic methods are discussed. Results of experiments using drainage networks are presented and indicate that further study and refinement are warranted. The first method involves etching the network on a copper plate and measuring its capacitance. The capacitance of each network plate is shown to have a strong association with the total length of the stream network. The second method uses a flying-spot scanner on either hand-drafted transparencies or directly on radar images. Data obtained by measurement of the edge-enhanced lines marking film-density boundaries show a high correlation with the total length of stream networks. Application of this latter method would permit acquisition of terrain data from large areas in a very short time."

 "Ecological statistical studies employing methods of multivariate analysis, based on a radiomimetic or mutagenic hypothesis, have yielded a number of statistically significant multiple regression equations in which concentrations of environmental chemicals, largely air pollutants, predict annual mortality rates for major categories of cancer and heart disease, as well as for congenital malformations, for populations of 38 metropolitan areas of the United States. Median age of these populations was also predicted statistically. Squares of multiple correlation coefficients R2 in excess of 0.5 were frequently obtained for these equations along with related t and F statistics of suitable magnitude. A new computer program for optimal regression analysis was employed in the studies. Among the chemical predictors whose atmospheric concentrations are frequently found positively correlated with mortality rates are SO2, NO2, and particulate sulfate. Among frequently recurring negatively correlated predictors are Cu, Cd, and Ti. Evidence regarding whether SO2 and NO2 may be considered as mutagenic hazards to life is discussed, as are some potentially relevant biochemical functions of the metals."
"The lunar surface magnetometer is one of five instruments in the Apollo lunar surface experiments package (ALSEP). It measures three components of the vector magnetic field in the range 0 to 400ϒ with a resolution of 0.2ϒ and a frequency response from dc to 3 Hz. This instrument also has a gradient measuring capability, making it an automatic magnetic observatory on the lunar surface. The magnetometer experiment deployed by Astronauts Conrad and Bean on Apollo 12 has measured a steady magnetic field of approximately 36ϒ on the lunar surface. During each lunar day-night period the magnetic fields in the geomagnetic tail, transition zone, and interplanetary region are superimposed upon this steady field. Measurements of the induced lunar magnetic field will permit the interior electrical conductivity and temperature to be calculated."
"The world's first Orbiting Astronomical Observatory, OAO-II, was launched by the U.S.A. on December 7, 1968. Over one year of operation has proven its design concepts and utility. Built in an octahedron shape, 10 feet by 7 feet, the satellite weighs 4400 pounds. Two experiments are located centrally within the space-craft, each viewing space from opposite ends. Both experiments contain multiple optical and detector systems for spectrophotometry and surveys in the ultraviolet spectrum. The design was dictated by the stringent requirements of the experiments for pointing accuracy (one minute of arc anywhere in the celestial sphere), pointing stability (five seconds of arc), command capability, data handling, thermal environment, and the constraints of the orbit for ground-station contacts. Six two-gimbal star trackers are programmed by the on-board memory to acquire and track appropriate guide stars. Error signals are generated which drive the reaction wheels to obtain stellar stabilization. Coarse momentum wheels are used for slewing the spacecraft. Memories permit storage of 200 000 bits of experimental data. All information is relayed to the central control station in Greenbelt, Md. OAO-II has shown that it is practical to maintain a continuous viewing capability in space for long periods of time so that fruitful astronomical experiments can be performed."
"As predicted in early planning for the exploitation of space technology, astronomy stands to benefit greatly from observations made in wavelengths blocked to earthbound view by the earth's atmosphere. The first to be attacked has been the ultraviolet spectral region, where young hot stars have their peak energy emission. The Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO) series of NASA satellites at present includes four major experiment packages, two of which have (April, 1970) completed more than sixteen months of successful astronomical observations from orbit in the ultraviolet,"
"Astronomy has taken a significant step forward with the success of NASA's Orbiting Astronomical Observatory designated OAO-A2. This 4400-pound satellite, the heaviest and most complex unmanned observatory developed by the United States, was launched on December 7, 1968 from Cape Kennedy. On April 5, 1970 it was in its 485th day of operation which represents almost 7000 orbits of which 88 percent have been available for experimentation. During this period of time astronomers have made over 6600 observations of stars, galaxies, planets, and nebulae. It is estimated that OAO has executed over one-half million commands. The ground system and operations reflect the complexity of the observatory and its mission. The requirements on the ground system to support flight operations include a sophisticated integration of men and data systems. One day of viewing involves over a thousand observatory commands. Eight dedicated computers involving almost 500 man-years of programming and the exclusive assignment of over 200 highly trained operations personnel and astronomers are required to operate OAO around the clock, seven days a week."
"A simulation of the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO) is described. The simulator was a hybrid comprised of a prototype spacecraft and a digital computer and was capable of simulating virtually all the functions of an orbiting OAO spacecraft as well as a large number of possible malfunctions. Optical stimuli and a solar array simulator on the prototype spacecraft were elements of the simulation and were controlled by the computer. The simulation was used in verifying the design and performance of the OAO ground-system hardware and software and to train spacecraft controllers."
"Results of the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO) observations of comets, novae, and galaxies are described as benefits from maintaining a continuous observing capability in space. The increased capabilities of the next two OAOs are cited as providing the basis for future astronomy missions. A practical and economical approach to space astronomy is developed on the basis of commonalty at the subsystem level. This approach, space telescopes for astronomical research, called Project STAR, provides the capability of flying optical telescopes with diameters of up to 120 inches, as well as major solar and X-ray instruments. The potential of resupply missions based on the space shuttle concept is developed."
"The Nimbus program is the nation's major research and development satellite program aimed at developing and exploiting space technology for meteorological and other application purposes. The program envisioned, and has achieved, the development of a series of large amply powered earth-stabilized spacecraft which use a near-polar circular orbit at the 600-nmi height to provide full earth coverage each day of operation. Some of the technological and scientific achievements of the Nimbus program are noted as follows: 1) first capability for high-resolution global mapping of the earth cloud cover from space by means of TV and IR techniques; 2) development of an automatic picture-taking system providing global coverage day and night and for providing cloud-cover data in an operational mode to local users; 3) first large spacecraft to fly a radioisotopic thermoelectric generator for in-orbit power generation; 4) the flight of sounder instrumentation to measure atmospheric temperatures and humidity profiles on a global basis; 5) first orbiting experiment to successfully locate, interrogate, and gather data from remote platforms located on the earth surface and in the atmosphere. Tracking of balloons have provided first satellite data on atmospheric winds."
"The interrogation, recording, and location system (IRLS) is a satellite technological experiment designed to demonstrate the feasibility of determining position location and collecting scientific data from remote instrumented platforms deployed on a global scale on, or above, the surface of the earth. The system utilizes a range-range location technique which yields solutions as the intersection of ranging spheres; up to 28 channels of sensory data are collected with each platform interrogation. In operation, discrete addresses of platforms expected in radioview are programmed on an orbit-by-orbit basis from a central ground acquisition and command station; data retrieval is accomplished one orbit later. The experiment commenced in April, 1969 (Nimbus III launch) and has since achieved its major objectives in accordance with a preestablished operational plan wherein the satellite, ground computer, and platforms functioned as an entity during orbit-to-orbit operation to provide locations and data collection from balloonborne, shipborne, ice-island, buoy, and land-deployed platforms, with a total complement numbering 10. In addition, the experiment has afforded an opportunity to the potential user community to participate in and contribute to the system technological evaluation while also performing specific scientific experiments. This participation has consisted in the installation and operation of platforms in the field. The results of the individual platform data collection and tracking experiments together with an analysis of overall system performance in terms of data quality and location accuracy achieved are described. In addition, future experiments planned for Nimbus D are discussed."
"A data-handling concept is described which provides a great degree of flexibility in the sampling and formatting of satellite data, the flexibility being achieved without design or wiring changes. The system was conceived and breadboarded at Goddard Space Flight Center and is now successfully flying on the Nimbus IV spacecraft."
"The Nimbus III/SNAP-19 launch on April 14, 1969, represented the first flight of a nuclear power supply on a NASA observatory and the culmination of six years of interagency effort between NASA and the AEC. The SNAP-19 consists of two generators, two dc-dc converters, and a telemetry signal conditioning unit. Power is produced by converting the radioactive heat of decay of the isotope Pu-238 in a static thermopile consisting of 90 PbTe 2n-3p couples per generator. SNAP-19 S/N 009 produced 49.02 watts of usable power at launch and has degraded to 44.03 watts after 7½ months, which represents a significantly higher degradation rate than predicted prior to launch from endurance testing of the same technology in electrically heated generators. Leakage of generator fill gas has resulted in a pressure drop from 15.5 to 1.32 psia. Generator currents have decreased as generator internal resistances have increased with time. Hot-cold junction temperatures have risen about 5°F during this period. while fin root tenperatures have risen 2-3°F"
"Two infrared grating spectrometers have been developed for the Nimbus meteorological satellite program to determine the feasibility of indirectly sensing vertical atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles from space. Each instrument senses radiation in the 15 m carbon dioxide band. The second instrument flown on Nimbus IV, has the added capability of a sensing-beam scan for better geographic-data sampling, and it also measures in six additional spectral intervals in the water-vapor rotation band. From inflight calibrations the digitized voltage outputs are transformed into spectral radiances which are in turn transformed into vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. Examples of temperature profiles near the Philippine Islands are shown. These indicate time and location differences in the temperatures of the upper troposphere and the stratosphere obtained from the two independent satellite measurements."
"On August 9, 1969, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration launched a little publicized but successful control system, utilizing the second stage of the Delta booster used to inject the Orbiting Solar Observatory into orbit. This experiment demonstrated the feasibility of a new low-cost attitude control system with potential for making platforms for earth-oriented experiments out of otherwise expended boosters such as the OSO-Delta. Utilizing the gravity gradient torque available from the long thin booster, the Delta packaged attitude control (PAC) system is a semiactive three-axis system that utilizes no expendables. The system is based on the use of a gimbaled reaction wheel scanner loosely coupled to its mounting by a soft spring and a damper. The control system uses only one motor which provides gyroscopic action, provides a reaction torque by accelerating in response to a pitch error, and rotates the optics in an infrared optical system whose cone scanning action locates the earth's horizons. The motor's magnetic pickoffs furnish speed information and vertical reference data. The electronics, tailored to enable the motor to achieve its objectives, is based on hardware developed for the Nimbus D attitude control system which was launched in April, 1970."
"An ion energy analyzer with on-board data reduction techniques has been developed to measure ion temperature and ion concentration with very high temporal resolution. The basic concept employed is to differentiate the characteristic volt-ampere curve within the instrument and to detect and store the maximum of the differentiated signal. This information coupled with the maximum ion concentration, obtained when the sweep voltage is negative, is sufficient to determine the ion temperature even when three different ion mass groups (molecular ions, atomic ions, light ions) are present. Consequently, high temporal resolution ion temperatures may be obtained with very limited telemetry bandwidth."
"An interdisciplinary design team at Purdue University, Lafayette, Ind., is developing a system for probing tornadoes. The objective of the program is to obtain horizontal profiles of temperature, pressure, wind velocity, and magnetic field in and around a tornado vortex. The present plan for achieving these objectives includes an aircraft to search for tornadoes on \"tornado days.\" Upon sighting a tornado the aircraft will fire a 2.75-inch rocket into the vortex. This 2.75-inch rocket will be outfitted both with instrumentation for measuring pressure, temperature, magnetic field, and wind velocity and with a telemetry system for relaying data back to the launch aircraft. The launch aircraft will contain equipment for recording the telemetry information, and photographic equipment will be used to make indirect measurements."
"In a cloud chamber of 25 m3, the precipitation of a fog, composed of water droplets smaller than 20 m in diameter, was investigated. Electrostatic charge was introduced through a corona discharge (between a thin wire or two wires of opposite polarity and a large grounded plane) pulse lasting from 0.2 to 1 second. Experiments have shown that the fog is unaffected by small electric charge. The modification occurs only when the droplets charge exceeds some critical value, about 10-16C for droplets of a diameter between 10 and 20 m. Unipolar charge greater than 3 C slightly increased the fog precipitation. Bipolar charges on the other hand accelerated the precipitation. This effect was well pronounced with charge content (of both signs) above 6 C."
"A theoretical correlation technique, based on data derived from the geophysical experimental results available in the literature, is offered for typical earth and planetary surface-soil dielectric constants and conductivity. Then an experimental equipment design is given for use in such work. This instrumentation was built and used at the University of Houston to verify the said technique. A similar experiment has been proposed, to be performed on the lunar surface by astronauts in the Apollo program."
"Earth strains of approximately 1 × 10-9 to 1 × 10-5 in the frequency range 0-0.1 Hz are recorded on magnetic tape with a 30-day unattended recording capability. Strains over a horizontal 6-meter interval are detected by a dual variable-capacitance transducer attached to a quartz-tube translating member. Differential earth displacements sensed by capacitor plates are converted to variations in oscillator pulsewidths. The pulsewidths are averaged and amplified before being transmitted by cable from a tunnel or a buried-trench installation to a nearby recording facility. A voltagecontrol circuit maintains the output signal within a dynamic range of 30 dB for an input-signal range of 66 dB. This is accomplished by an offset-biasing technique using a precision level detector and a digital-to-analog converter. The number and polarity of the offset increments are recorded on a separate track of the tape recorder for restoration of the input signal. Temperature measurements are resolvable to within 0.001°C by a voltage-control circuit. Calibration of the strainmeter is accomplished with a temperature-compensated electromagnetic calibrator mounted at the fixed end of the quartz tubing. Repositioning of the capacitor plates and calibration of the transducer are controlled by a fine-adjust mechanism. Use of a stepping motor and motion reducer permits positioning of the capacitor plates over a range of 12 × 10-6 meters in steps of 5 × 10-9 meters."
"A new type of strip-chart recorder is described that has been used extensively on high-altitude balloon flights. Driven by a stepper motor and powered by a wide-range timing circuit, it maintains an accurate timne base. The unit is particularly suited to applications where severe environmental conditions are encountered and low battery drain operation is necessary."
"A computer system which is operated from a remote terminal has been developed at Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Laboratories, to perform Fourier-transform analysis on time data rapidly and accurately. As many as 512 samples can be taken at frequencies up to 20 kHz, or digital data can be read directly into the computer memory. Fourier transforms, cross spectra, and autospectra can be determined for real or complex data. Hardware in the system consists of the computer and its standard peripherals; a general interface, which is a nonstandard peripheral device developed at Battelle-Northwest; and the communication link between the computer and the remotely located user. Software in the system is highly modular and consists of control and mathematical subroutines. Mathematical operations performed are the fast Fourier transform, complex multiplication, and conjugation. Transforms for 512 points can be calculated in five seconds, and a single real signal can be sampled and digitized at 20 kHz. Example calculations show that frequency components with relative amplitude ranges of five decades can be easily recognized. Calculation noise is a factor of a million less than the largest frequency component measured. The remote terminal allows the user with a complex experiment to have full-time direct access to the computer, but the computer room is not cluttered with his special-purpose experimental apparatus."
"The relations among the holographic parameters of focal length, aperture, and wavelength and the system parameters of resolution and stability in the horizontal and vertical are developed for the application of acoustic holography to mapping and searching the sea floor. The relative advantages of pulsed and continuous acoustic sources are discussed, the concept of the sanitized signals from a pulsed source is introduced, and the implications in terms of forbidden zones and statistical uncertainty in the amplitude of the mean scattered signal are developed. The information content of the acoustic holographic surface and the required sampling spatial density are presented. The area scan rate of the holographic system is related to the system parameters. A conceptual design of an acoustic deep-water holographic system, Sea Fan, is described as an example of the application of the constraints previously developed. The scan rate of Sea Fan is compared with some present methods of searching the sea floor. An optical reconstruction process involving the superposition of a cohologram and a quadrature hologram is described."
"Ocean-floor mapping requires good geodetic control and the use of sensors capable of detecting features on and below the water-bottom interface. Optical sensors have been useful. Film cameras with their permanent record are preferable to human observers and television. Since the loss of the Thresher the effectiveness of cameras has been increased by the use of wide-angle lenses and larger film loads. Recent experiments indicate that further gains will result from locating the lights behind the camera. Magnetic sensors are useful adjuncts to deep sea cameras. In many cases the causes of magnetic anomalies are visible in photographs made at the same time."
"The variability of sea-surface conditions has been observed from a low-flying aircraft by a laser-wave profiling system and a scanning horizontally polarized 19.35-GHz passive microwave radiometer for fetch-limited wind speeds of 17 to 25 m/s in the North Sea. Wave profiles obtained with the laser system have been analyzed and show that wave growth occurs simultaneously at all frequencies and that an equilibrium value for the higher frequency components is eventually reached, but not before substantially higher (overshoot) values are obtained. Simultaneous observations of the microwave brightness temperature at vertical incidence show an increase with wind speed (or roughness of the sea surface) of 1°K/m/s. This increase, not in accord with theory, is shown to be a function of the percentage of foam coverage of the ocean surface."
"An advanced electromagnetic technique for deducing depths of water tables as well as the conductivities of subsurface strata is described. Field data have been collected in the vicinity of Dale Dry Lake, in southern California, and our interpretation thereof is in very good agreement with geologic well data. The technique consists essentially of adapting a curve-matching process to the \"two-coil tilt angle method.\" The variables used were tilt angle as a function of frequency with coil-coil spacing as the parameter. Water table depths at 10 and 30 feet, respectively, have been uniquely deduced as well as the conductivities of the ground-water and upper-layer overburden. In addition, the interpretation scheme facilitates the establishment of the most sensitive operating parameters for deducing a given depth of groundwater. For at least the two-layer case, our preliminary investigation has demonstrated that the depth to a conductvitity discontinuity can be uniquely determined by electromagnetic means."
"Density, contrast, and contrast frequency were tested as textural attributes of wheat, sorghum, alfalfa, wheat stubble, and weeds, all crops having similar average density values on multipolarization K-band radar imagery but dissimilar plant geometries. Fifty-three microphotographs of fields displayed on Hedernheim (HH) imagery were scanned with a transmission densitometer, and contrast frequency values were derived. These measures did not yield significantly more information than that obtained in previous studies. It is, nevertheless, felt that texture and its associated attributes can often serve as reliable discriminants of crops and other areal extensive objects and contribute to the solution of automatic pattern recognition problems."
"The earth-resources technology satellite (ERTS) NASA Data-Processing Facility (NDPF) is organized functionally into two units: 1) the telemetry and image data processing (TIDP) where the bulk of all data are transformed into user-oriented media; and 2) The data services laboratory (DSL) where all production scheduling, accounting, cataloging, storage and retrieval, dissemination, and user services will be performed. The NDPF will be a dedicated facility for doing only ERTS processing and will be colocated with the Operations Control Center (OCC) on the top floor of Building 23 at Goddard Space Flight Center. The facility is being planned to be capable of processing a data volume based on continental U. S. coverage plus 1 hour per day of video data obtained from an on-board wide-band video tape recorder."
"A system for spatial registration of digitized multispectral and multitemporal imagery is described. Multispectral imagery can be obtained from sources such as multilens cameras, multichannel optical-mechanical line scanners, or multiple vidicon systems which employ filters or other spectral separation techniques to sense selected portions of the spectrum. Spatial registration is required so that multidimensional analysis can be performed on contextually similar image elements from different wavelength bands and at different times. The general registration problem is discussed first; then the fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique for cross correlation of misregistered imagery to determine spatial distances is discussed in detail. A method of achieving translational, rotational, and scaling corrections between images is described. Results of correlation analysis of multispectral scanner imagery and digitized satellite photography is presented. Use of the system for registration of multispectral airborne line-scanner imagery and space photography is described. Application of the techniques to preprocessing of earth resources satellite imagery from systems such as the earth-resources technology satellite (ERTS) scanner and vidicon system is discussed in conclusion."

"This paper outlines the advantages and necessity of controlling viewing conditions for the critical review of color film and picture on color TV monitors. Practices and standards of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for the review of color film by direct projection are given. These are different in several significant respects from formerly used practices and are designed to give subjective response similar to that gotten when the film is viewed on a TV monitor. Viewing conditions for TV monitor pictures are also specified."
"The training of a broadcasting staff is as essential a requirement in the expansion of any broadcasting system as are the bricks and mortar of its buildings, and the equipment itself. In countries of developing Africa it has even greater significance as there are no readily available sources from which such a staff can be drawn, or sufficient numbers already in similar employment who for various reasons might be attracted to a change. New projects must therefore of necessity include planning for both capital development and staff training simultaneously."
"The equipment described is believed to represent a new approach to the problem of pinpointing noise sources on power lines. A unidirectional receiver employing a loop and dipole antenna is used in the 30-MHz band. The operation of the device relies upon the fact that noise sources generally contain components covering a wide frequency range and that the components in the range of the receiver are attenuated fairly rapidly along the line due to radiation and other losses. This attenuation in effect partially terminates the line so that reflections causing standing waves are greatly reduced. When a noise source is to be located the operator stands under the line in question and takes readings of the noise level first with the unit pointed along the line in one direction and then in the other. The direction of the noise source is generally in the direction of the higher of the two readings. The locator unit is completely self-contained. The total weight is 5 1/2 pounds. The battery life is approximately 75 to 100 hours."
"A computer program has been investigated and developed for the calculation of the far field radiation pattern of an antenna array. This paper contains an IBM 360/65 program for the calculation of the far field pattern with accuracy checks on the pattern obtained by using radio stations KXIC and WSUI, both located in Iowa City, Iowa, as assumed normals. Two theories of solving the far field calculation problem with the SDS-92/TR-48 hybrid computer are submitted."
"The maximum visual effective radiated power now permitted by the FCC for UHF TV is 5 000 000 watts. All manufacturers now have available 110-to 150-kilowatt transmitters with antennas having power gains of 35 to 60. Stations contemplating an increase to the maximum permitted power are faced with the difficult problem of selecting the type and size of transmission line to be used. The choice is between 6 1/8-inch, 8 3/16-inch, or 9 3/16-inch coax line or WR-1500 or WR-1150 waveguide. This paper discusses some of the cost and technical tradeoff considerations that must be evaluated in selecting the proper type and size of transmission line."

"There are many situations in television tape recording where sequences composed of several short recordings are required. Typical instances are commercial sequences, news programs, or program assembly applications. Broadcasting these sequences with present-day equipment requires a large amount of manual tape handling and considerable skill from the operators."
"In VHF FM stereophonic broadcasting, the 19-kHz pilot subcarrier is transmitted with prescribed phase related to the 38-kHz stereophonic subcarrier. A small phase departure tolerance is desirable to avoid crosstalk. The present paper describes a method and an instrument suitable for simple measuring and checking of the pilot-subcarrier phase departure. Monitoring during regular broadcast is also possible. The accuracy of the phase departure measurement is better then 0.5°and the calibration of the instrument does not require an oscilloscope or any additional instrument."
"The state of the art of geostationary satellites makes it feasible to provide direct community broadcasts to convey tional Television (ITV) and Educational Television (ETV) programs. The wide coverage provided by such satellites makes it imperative to provide multiple sound channels along with a common video program."
"The effects of wave polarization on the transmission and reception of ionospheric radio waves have been discussed. Special attention was given to the effects of polarization on the excitation of characteristic waves in the ionosphere, on the absorption losses in the ionosphere, on the reception of arbitrarily polarized plane waves, and on the polarization coupling losses. In this work only one-hop paths were considered and it was assumed that the operating frequency is in the HF region so that ray theory treatment may be applied with high accuracy. The results of investigation have shown that wave polarization is an important and sometimes critical factor in the overall performance of ionospheric radio networks. It is believed that careful consideration of the wave polarization effects in the design of reliable and efficient communication and broadcasting networks can result in relatively lower transmitter power and in the reduction of the number of channels occupied by a particular station."

"One of the most critical performance characteristics of a TV antenna system is its ability to transmit a ghost-free picture. RF pulse techniques have been developed to evaluate this performance characteristic. Such measurements can be made to simulate the actual operational conditions of the antenna system very closely. During the past years, several RF pulse-measuring methods have gained acceptance here and abroad. The principles of some of these techniques are presented here and their advantages and limitations are evaluated. Additionally, some instrumentation problems are presented and precautionary steps indicated."
"The main purpose of this paper is to analyze the performance ormance of the voltage standing-waveratio (VSWR) and 0.25RF pulse technique when measuring the echo performance of TV transmitting systems. In order to do so, the specifications devised by D. J. Whythe for the ghost-free operation of such systems were used. The conclusion reached is that neither the VSWR nor the 0.25s RF pulse techniques are adequate. Another method using a long RF pulse is suggested and shown to be very accurate."
"The important phases of the engineering work that produced the new color transmitters are described. The subjects include intermediate frequency (IF) modulation, visual and aural exciter design, active group-delay compensation, power tube development, and solid-state control logic. They reflect the advanced technology employed in the transmitters. The resulting engineering work has one ultimate objective: unsurpassed color transmission."

"An analysis and experimental results are presented of a new color camera technique using a single camera tube. To avoid the difficult registration problem of conventional color cameras, the color information is encoded as the amplitude of two diffraction grating patterns. This is accomplished by imaging the colored scene onto a pair of colored diffraction gratings. The recovery of the color information is done by bandpass filtering of each channel followed by envelope detection. The three color signals are derived using linear combinations of the two decoded carriers along with the average signal, which represents a weighted sum of all three colors."
"In the interests of facilitating the international exchange of television programs, the International Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR) at its XII Plenary Assembly in New Delhi in January-February of 1970 approved a new recommendation unendation for international vertical interval test signals. The recommendation covers both major television systems, the 625-line/50-field and 525-line/60-field systems, and specifies the lines in the vertical blanking interval that are to be reserved for this purpose. Additionally the recommendation details the specific waveforms, or test signal elements, for the 625-line/50-field systems. These waveforms represent the results of years of technical discussions among transmission experts of the countries involved. They are described in some detail for the information of U.S. broadcasters as well as broadcasters in other countries using the 52-line/ 60-field systems, since many of these same deliberations have also taken place and will continue to take place in the development of the international vertical interval test signal for 525-line/60-field transmissions."
"The Fourier method for time domain synthesis is applied to find the transfer functions of five-, seven-, and nine-pole networks that have an impulse response approximating a sine-squared pulse to an increasing degree of accuracy. Results are compared to a seven-pole Thomson network. Where the departures of the impulse response from the sine-squared curve reach 2 percent of the peak amplitude in a seven-pole Thomson network, the new seven-pole network does not exceed 1.3 percent, whereas the nine-pole network is within 0.7 percent. Practical networks are synthesized from the transfer functions, both of the single-and double-terminated ated type."
"This is a report by the Subcommittee on Transmission and Transmission Paths of the Ad Hoc Committee for Color Television study, established by the Joint Committee for Intersociety Coordinators (JCIC). It presents an objective analysis, based on tests made in Chicago, of video transmission characteristics related to color performance. The study finds significant departures from perfect performance in this segment of the overall system, makes recommendations for tighter tolerances on several current FCC signal specifications, and suggests the addition of other characteristics not now specified."

"In recent years there has been an increasing interest shown by engineers and scientists in problems of ecology and sociology. Many of these problems when viewed as a set of interacting variables take on the characteristics of a large scale system of the man-machine-environment type, and are in many ways similar to those found in the aerospace and process control industries. Because of his special skills in system modeling and optimization, the control systems engineer can make a significant contribution in this area. This paper is directed toward getting control system engineers to exhibit a greater interest in this expanding area. After establishing a reference framework, the paper categorizes problems and gives selective bibliography to assist newcomers in this area. The bibliography is in no way considered exhaustive nor complete, but should serve as an introduction to the problems existing in this area."
"This paper extends previously published results on the application of a dynamic programming optimization approach to the planning of systems, with special emphasis on the long-term expansion of power systems. Future uncertainties about loads, equipment costs, etc. are considered explicitly in the method described. A practical computational solution to the resulting stochastic optimization is obtained by means of the recently developed open-loop feedback approximation. Further, it is shown how various known approaches of production cost simulation can be used in conjunction with the dynamic programming optimization to accommodate large systems that may be represented with great technical detail."
"The possible role of the control theorist in the development of innovative new transportation systems is discussed. In particular, it is noted that the most promising of the new systems are very dependent on automatic control and/or efficient routing and scheduling for their success. Thus, the control theorist can play a vital role in the design of new systems. It is further noted that the system theorist is well suited to help develop better techniques for analyzing the usage of potential new systems and forecasting their regional impact."
"In recent years there has been considerable interest in applying the methods of mathematical linguistics to picture generation and description [1]. In this approach, pictures are regarded as combinations of subpictures, which are in turn built up out of still smaller parts, in analogy with the way that sentences can be broken down into phrases and words. Conventionally, however, mathematical linguistics deals with strings (of words, etc.), whereas pictures do not usually have natural representations as strings of subpictures. This suggests that it would be desirable to generalize the tools of mathematical linguistics so as to allow combining parts into wholes by methods more general than string concatenation."
"This paper is concerned with the use of nonlinear regression analysis as a means for achieving pictorial pattern recognition. The object to be identified is presumed to be represented by a set of image plane coordinates representing points associated with its boundary. Regression analysis techniques are then used to produce a sequence of computationally generated templates for various types of objects. The best fitting template type determines the classification of the object. Experimental results relating to a four class problem involving ellipses, rectangles, concave cresents, and convex cresents are presented."
"Recent work at Ohio State University on algorithmic pattern generation is reviewed. A display manifold (quadratic lattice) is filled with symbols satisfying axioms of some algebraic structure by using the production rules of the structure and some initial or boundary condition to start the filling process. The algorithms operate \"locally\" to generate \"global\" patterns, often of great beauty. The tremendous variety in pattern obtained with a fixed algorithm can be interpreted as \"adaptations\" of the algorithms to different conditions, imposed externally. Computer generated examples will be shown of both periodic and non-periodic patterns using a variety of systems, and some of the general theorems discussed, Examples from nature strongly suggest that inorganic and biological structures of many kinds may well be constructed in accordance with similar principles. Connections with other branches of mathematics and computer science (universal algebras, number theory, parallel computation, cellular automata) are pointed out."
"Given a hypothesis testing problem about the bias of a coin for heads, H0 : p = P0 and H1 : p = p1, and a finite memory constraint, Cover and Hellman have derived a lower bound on the error probability achievable by finite state machines and they have also given a procedure which achieves this performance arbitrarily closely. The procedure requires randomization, whose memory requirements sometimes we may not be able to meet. This paper gives a procedure in which the expedient of a \"laboratory\" processing a large number of problems is used to achieve error probabilities close to the lower bound for each problem; in essence, the procedure employs the statistics of the problems themselves in a suitable way to simulate the randomizer."
"This paper is concerned with the effects of randomization on finite memory decision rules [1]. It is shown that for any twohypothesis testing problem, there exists a b < ∞, such that for all B, the optimal randomized rule using a memory with B bits has a probability of error no smaller than that of the optimal deterministic rule using B+b bits. Thus as B→∞ the fraction of bits lost by using deterministic rules tends to zero, and in this sense deterministic rules are asymptotically optimal."
 "The problem considered in this two-part paper deals with the control of linear, discrete-time, stochastic systems with unknown (possibly time-varying and random) gain parameters. The philosophy of control is based on the use of an open-loop-feedback-optimal (O.L.F.O.) control using a quadratic index of performance. In Part I it is shown that the O.L.F.O. system consists of (1) an identifier that estimates the system state variables and gain parameters, and (2) by a controller described by an \"adaptive\" gain and correction term. Several qualitative properties of the overall system are obtained from an interpretation of the equations. Part II deals with the asymptotic properties of the O.L.F.O. adaptive system and with simulation results dealing with the control of stable and unstable third order plants. Comparisons are carried out with the optimal system when the parameters are known. In addition, the simulation results are interpreted in the context of the qualitative conclusions reached in Part I."
 "A modified Liapunov design technique for model reference adaptive control system is shown to result in improved system convergence. An adaptive rule, derived on the basis of a new Liapunov function, is compared to the previous rule. A local stability analysis applied to the modified design shows that the error response is more rapidly convergent. Furthermore, system simulations show that the transient response for the adjustable parameters is also improved. A second result presented is a design technique for a class of plants whose parameters cannot be adjusted directly. This design leads to a system with a set of prefilter and feedback adjustable gains as the adaptive parameters and physically realizable linear time-invariant filter networks in both the feedback and prefilter paths. It eliminates the problem of nonunique adaptive laws previously encountered and requires only n - m - 1 derivative networks for its implementation (nth order plant with m zeros); hence, if m = n - 1, no derivative networks are required for implementation. In order to maintain a bounded plant input signal, the zeros of the plant transfer function must be restricted to the open left-half plane."
"A technique of adaptive control, called an accelerated gradient method, is presented which is capable of adapting rapidly to plant parameter variations. It is based upon the objective of improving the stability characteristics of a gradient-type model reference adaptive control system. A design procedure is developed for an nth order linear plant. It is applied to the control of pitch motion for an airframe; simulation results comparing the technique with conventional gradient methods are presented."
"This paper considers the problem of random search in the case where a gradient is used to bring the solution toward a local minimum, and a white noise perturbation is added to drive the solution toward the global minimum. Such an algorithm has been suggested by several authors (see, for example, Khas'minskii [1], Yudin [2], Gurin [3], and Vaysbord[4],[5]). The problem is considered in terms of the \"differential generator\" of the stochastic process. It is shown that the algorithm does not converge to a global minimum. However, in the case where the value of the function at the global minimum is known, but the point at which the global minimum occurs is not known, the results show that this search technique can be used to keep the system's state at this point."
"The paper outlines a particular computer aided design philosophy for the control of single input-single output discrete systems subject to disturbances with rational spectral density. The design procedure is based on identification and synthesis; computer aided methods of off-line and on-line process identification provide sufficient information for the synthesis of a constrained input, minimum variance control algorithm of particularly simple form. In this sense, the present approach to control systems design provides a possible systematic alternative to more conventional methods, such as three term control. Since the complete design procedure is composed in part of certain existing techniques, the paper can also be considered as a short review of the subject."
"Four theorems characterizing optimal filtered and smoothed estimates for linear parabolic systems are presented. The models considered include the effects of internal system noise as well as measurement noise. Cases involving measurement data given either on the system's boundary or over its interior are examined. The two theorems on optimal filtering represent extensions and refinements of earlier work; the two theorems on optimal smoothing are new."
"The problem of designing an optimum filter for a general class of linear distributed-parameter systems with correlated in time and space measurement noise is studied. The input stochastic disturbance is assumed to be white in time, but it is allowed to have any correlation in space. The filter is designed by making use of a learning theorem which gives the mean value and covariance matrix of a conditional distributed-parameter random variable \"X1(D) given X2(D)\" where X1(D) = {X1(x):xεD} and X2(D) = {X2(x):xεD} are Gaussian variables with known mean values and covariance matrices. A numerical example is computed to illustrate the theory. The results of the paper may find applications in all areas where the information to be processed is distributed in space."
"This paper presents computational algorithms for weighting function estimation and optimal control synthesis in one-dimensional, linear distributed-parameter systems. Using the least square approach, functional gradient procedures are developed for estimating system weighting functions associated with either boundary or distributed control. Same functional gradient procedures are also used to generate the optimal control function when a final state quadratic error criterion is chosen. These algorithms should be suitable for on-line adaptive control since optimal control function itself can be used as input for estimation. Finally, results from computer simulation study of a heat diffusion system are presented. They clearly demonstrate the convergence of these algorithms."
"Optimal state estimation in linear systems with time delay is investigated. The application of optimum control theory leads to a split boundary value problem. The existence of the solution to the two-point boundary value problem is investigated. It is shown that the adjoint system (costate equations) must be completely controllable to a function (complete observability) with respect to the initial function in order to solve the two-point boundary value problem. Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented. Equations for the optimal estimator, which can be solved on-line, are derived. These equations are applied to an example to illustrate the applicability of the approach."
"An estimator is developed for the class of systems which can be modeled as a partial differential equation with input disturbances having Gaussian statistics. The errors associated with output observations are considered to be additive and Gaussian in nature. The estimator is shown to be a linear distributed dynamic system whose input is the observation process. Under the requirement that the estimate is 'unbiased' it is seen that the characterisation of the gain matrix completely determines the estimator. The optimal gain matrix is obtained using the maximum principle. The optimal estimator so obtained turns out to be a generalised version of Kalman-Bucy filter."
 "In a recent paper, a bound on the probability of runaway for a decision-directed receiver with unknown a priori probabilities was obtained. The analysis approximated the dependent learning process with a random walk model with independent increments. It is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate that by incorporating the central limit theorem into the above-mentioned analysis, a simple expression for a bound on the probability of runaway can be obtained. Furthermore, by applying a multivariate version of the theorem, the modified technique can be extended to analyze decision-directed receivers with several unknown parameters and the corresponding runaway bounds can be obtained. (By contrast, it is well known that multi-dimensional restricted random walk models are extremely difficult to study.) The results of this study again show that the probability of runaway is quite small even at moderate signal-to-noise conditions."
"A sequential distribution free pattern classification procedure is presented to classify unknown samples into one of two inseparable classes for the case where the underlying probability density functions of the classes are unknown. The algorithm is formed from training sets of known classification. An estimate (on an expected value basis) is given of the probability of making an error in classification by using order statistics."
"We present a model of threshold learning that represents discrete one-dimensional processes by a continuous two-dimensional process. The model gives us an overall view of the learning dynamics of an expanded range of training procedures, and provides insight for expansion to multidimensional threshold logic gates. The expected performance is measured by learning curves, while the confidence in this expected performance is measured by variance curves. Previous work on the continuous approximation has been restricted to single-dimensional processes. We believe this theory will provide the designer of trainable pattern classifiers with tools for deciding when to stop training."
"This paper constitutes Part II of a series of papers on adaptive pattern recognition and its applications. It pertains to optimal, unsupervised learning, adaptive pattern recognition of \"lumped\" gaussian signals in white gaussian noise. Specifically, both deterministic decision directed learning as well as random decision directed learning algorithms for continuous data are obtained. It is shown that the supervised learning results [1], in particular the partition theorem are applicable in the directed learning approach to the unsupervised case [2]."
"Through a purely formal manipulation, one can show that the optimum detection of a zero-mean Gaussian signal in \"white Gaussian noise\" is achieved by the following decision rule: the signal is present if (x,Hx) ≥ c, the signal is absent otherwise, where x is the observable waveform, H is a solution of an integral equation H + SH = S, with S(t,s) being the signal covariance, and c is a preset threshold. Since the white Gaussian noise is a mathematical fiction, neither the quadratic form (x,Hx) nor the whole detection problem has any meaning. With the use of the Wiener process, however, we rigorously show that the above decision rule can be regarded as an approximate solution to a well-defined realistic optimum detection problem. By comparing with the exact solution, we give a qualitative argument that it is a good approximation."
"A new philosophy for designing detection devices is presented which embodies some of the better features of the classical generalized likelihood ratio test and the classical Bayes test. A feature of the new Bayes generalized likelihood ratio test is that it provides a unified procedure for utilizing parameter estimates in detector design. Its use depends on the existance of an asymtotically unbiased estimator for the unknown parameters. If such an estimator is easily implemented, then the new test should be particularly attractive."
"Practical algorithms are developed for recognizing the characteristic signature of a statistically modelled target when given a data record from a sensor observing a fixed spatial resolution element. Any one of many background objects could be present instead of the target. Since the background statistics may be poorly known, the objective is to devise an easily implemented detection method which can yield near-optimum performance without requiring a precise background model. It is shown that the simple chi-square test can meet this objective, in the sense that it should perform nearly as well as the optimum likelihood ratio test if the composite background probability density function can be adequately approximated by a constant over the detection region. This characteristic is implied when the false alarm probability can be made low. It is pointed out that the Chi-square test cannot be used to treat continuous data records. For this case, a continuous autocorrelation test is suggested which should have comparable performance. Dynamic modelling of the target stochastic process is suggested as a means for simplifying the implementation."
"The Bayesian approach in signal detection theory generally yields detectors with memory which contains appropriate statistics used in producing a detection output. This memory summarizes each available observation in terms of precisely representable continuous variables. Precise representation of any real number requires an infinity of digits which in turn means an infinite soft or changeable memory requirement. This presentation provides a procedure for design of sequentially operating finite memory detectors applicable to the open-ended type detection problem. The approach is applied to a general class of problems including the Signal-Known-Exactly (SKE), Signal-Known-Except-Amplitude (SKEA), and the M-ary signaling problems. Results presented compare the detection performance of the finite and optimum infinite memory detector designs using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)."
"Recent results on joint detection-estimation for discrete data are extended to the continuous data case for Gaussian signals in White Gaussian noise. Stochastic differential equations are obtained describing the temporal evolution of the sufficient statistic for minimum Bayes-risk detection and the optimal mean-square error estimate of the signal state vector. An approximate solution for the estimation equation is suggested."
"The adaptive control of tool life in order to realize a predetermined tool life for a material of which tool wear characteristic is unknown has been implemented for turning. The increase of tool wear is indirectly detected in an on-line or in-process fashion by means of a specially designed cutting force detector. On-line data analysis and control are executed by a process computer and a numerical controller equipped with a speed control system. The experiment has revealed that the optimizing control of turning operation in view of tool life can be achieved by the on-line identification of tool wear rate while sampling the signals via the variation of cutting force for a short time."
"An adaptive extremal control system is proposed and analyzed for application to rotating power systems, such as the standard multi-cylinder internal combustion engine. The system is comprised of a test input perturbation signal, a simple on-off accelerometer for output sensing, and a bang-bang adaptive loop that provides optimum settings of engine parameters, such as ignition timing. The proposed system is simpler than previous adaptive extremal systems in the literature and it exhibits improved performance characteristics with respect to stability and recovery rates."
 "The high rate of production desired in blooming and slabbing mills calls for a computer control system to calculate a pass schedule on-line for minimizing mill operating times by predicting roll force and roll torque. In predicting these control variables with high accuracy, three adaptive control methods are devised. These are: 1) Adaptive control to the latter passes of an ingot with use of rolling data in the former passes of the same ingot, 2) adaptive control to all passes of the next ingot with the data of preceeding ingots, and 3) adaptive control to each pass of the next ingot with the same pass data of preceeding ingots. The third is a unique method of adaptive control in a reversible rolling mill. This paper discusses these adaptive control methods and the effects of their combination. A combination of the first and third methods has revealed most practical in estimating roll force and roll torque."
"This paper describes the results of a simulation study carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of a Self Adaptive ACLS. Results indicate that such a system can successfully reduce system errors due to nonlinearities and noise effects."
 "Variable length vector pattern recognition deals with the problem of recognizing words of various symbol lengths (characters, phonemes, etc.) embedded in unsegmented strings of words (sentences, messages, etc.). A mathematical model is developed to describe the generation of such messages, assuming that successive words are chosen independently. A loss function is defined which leads to the development of an iterative decision procedure for minimizing the risk. The computational complexity of this procedure is proportional to message length, whereas the message length would appear exponentially in the expression for computational complexity if the iterative procedure did not exist. Alternative decision models and alternative loss functions can be employed in the development of similar iterative procedures. The optimum iterative procedure was programmed in ASA FORTRAN IV. An illustrative experiment was conducted using the program to compare performance of the procedure with and without segmentation information."
"It has been shown that the error rate on the design data is a monotonically increasing function of the ratio of sample size to feature size (N/L). Ratios of N/L > 3 are generally tolerable and ratios of N/L > 10 are generally adequate for design stability. It is felt that the results presented here should be kept in mind by those researchers who wish to demonstrate the potential of their pattern recognition algorithm using performance on a sample design set as the demonstration vehicle."
"A stopping rule is developed for a class of threshold learning processes (TLPs) that includes the training procedures occurring in certain pattern classifiers, psycho-physical and neural models of perception and in stochastic approximation. The present work is restricted to one-dimensional pattern spaces. Of the published work on stopping rules, all but Farrell assume that the sequence of observations are independent and identically distributed. The TLP model discussed here gives rise to sequential samples from independent non-identical distributions. The stopping rule presented is a result of the technique developed here for obtaining a bounded length confidence interval for a parameter which varies from trial to trial in these distributions. Training is stopped when the interval falls within pre-specified limits, thereby assuring a specified performance at any desired confidence level. The rule is illustrated by a numerical example. In the example, both variable and small fixed increment training are considered. An expression is also given for the limit to which the probability of acquiring the stopping criterion converges in probability."
"This paper presents some preliminary results on minimax feature extraction and selection using the Bhattacharyya coefficient as the selection criterion. It is assumed that the only knowledge of the two classes of pattern vectors is the mean vectors and the covariance matrices, and the minimax approach is attractive for this case because it is relatively insensitive to the variation of the true distributions. The maximization of the Bhattacharyya coefficient is discussed briefly."
"This paper discusses methods of estimating the probability of error for the Bayes' classifier which must be designed and tested with a finite number of classified samples. The expected difference between estimators is discussed. A simplified algorithm to compute Lachenbruch's method is proposed for multivariate normal distributions with unequal covariance matrices. Also, the variances of the likelihood ratios are given so as to compare them with the differences between the estimates. The discussion is extended to nonparametric classifiers by using the Parzen approximation for the density functions. Experimental results are shown for both parametric and nonparametric cases."
"If the nearest neighbor rule is used to classify unknown samples then Cover and Hart have shown that the average probability of error using n known samples (denoted by Rn)converges to a number R as n tends to infinity where R* ≤ R ≤ 2R* (1-R*) and R* is the Bayes probability of error. Here it is shown that when the samples lie in n-dimensional Euclidean space, the probability of error for the nearest nearest neighbor rule conditioned on the n known samples (denoted by Ln so that ELn = Rn) converges to R with probability 1 for mild continuity and moment assumptions on the class densities. Two estimates of R from the n known samples are shown to be consistent. Rates of convergence of Ln to R are also given."
"This paper investigates the identification of a class of rapidly varying parameters, bk (n × 1 vector), by means of sequential identification algorithms. These algorithms are heuristic extensions of relatively well known, constant-parameter, identification algorithms to the time-varying parameter situation. It is assumed that bk = P(k)ßk where P(k) is an n × n invertible information matrix whose elements are either measurable, or specified ahead of time, at tk, and ßk is a collection of unknown parameters which vary less rapidly than bk. Such a decomposition is often possible in aerospace applications. A priori and a posteriori identification algorithms are described and synthesized for both the perfect and noisy measurement situations. These algorithms are then applied to the identification of aerodynamic parameters of a high-performance, aerodynamically controlled aerospace vehicle. The feasibility of tracking these parameters by means of the a posteriori algorithms is demonstrated."
"A new canonical form of state variable equations (for a linear time-invariant system) is developed. This canonical form has the specialty that the state variables can easily be generated using the integrals of the input and the observable ouput. This special property can be exploited to identify the parameters of the unknown system. If the system whose parameters are to be determined, is found to be stable, identification of the parameters is shown to be very simple. Non-zero initial conditions are handled very easily by a proper choice of the input (excitation) function. The calculation of the unknown parameters involves the determination of integrals (with the consequent suppression of any effect of measurement noise) and solution of a linear system of algebraic equations. It is not necessary, theoretically at least, to assume the order of the unknown system to be identified. The proposed method of identification, it is believed, adapts itself in the development of a lower order approximate model for the unknown system."
"A direct procedure is presented for obtaining a minimal realization of a linear, time invariant, discrete system from observations of input and output. It is shown that the procedure can be used for almost any input sequence. Application of the procedure requires knowledge of an upper bound on the minimal system dimension; a modification is given to handle the situation where an upper bound is not known. The structure of the realization obtained is displayed and can be used as a check on the realization. An example is included to show the operation of the procedure."
"This paper considers the process identification by means an adjustable model. An approach to the synthesis of this type of on-line identification system via the hyperstability theory is proposed. Two typical situations for identification are considered (the \"ideal case\" and the \"real case\"). A theorem for synthesis of an identification system which assures a null error between the model and the process in the ideal case is presented. It is also proved that an identification system realised by this method assures a bounded error between the model and the process even in the cases when supplementary noises are applied to the process, when the process is with time variable parameters and when the model has a lower dimension than the model. The theoretical results were verified for some typical cases by analogical simulation."
"This paper considers the problem of determining a digital computer model for the heart rate system that includes nonrespiratory as well as respiratory effects on the heart rate. A sampled-data model is shown to be exact in certain cases and can be used with some errors for other cases. Several methods are developed for finding the model transfer function parameters as well as the parameters of a signal added to the system output. Linear and nonlinear models are considered."
"In many remote sensing applications, millions of measurements can be made from a satellite at one time, and many times the data is of marginal value. In these situations, clustering techniques might save much data transmission without loss of information since cluster codes may be transmitted instead of multi-dimensional data points. Data points within a cluster are highly similar so that interpretation of the cluster code can be meaningfully made on the basis of knowing what sort of data point is typical of those in the cluster. In this paper we introduce an iterative clustering technique. The procedure suboptimally minimizes the probability of differences between the binary reconstructions from the clusters codes and the original binary data. The iterative clustering technique was programmed for the GE-635, KANDIDATS (Kansas Digital Image Data System) system and tested on a multi-image data set. Twelve images of the northern part of Yellowstone Park were taken by the Michigan scanner system. The images were reduced and run with the program. Clustered into four clusters were 30,000 data points, each consisting of a binary vector of 25 components. The percentage difference between the components of the reconstructed binary data and the original binary data was 20.7 percent."
"Experiments with multispectral data have shown that it is possible to identify many desired terrain features. Such identifications often span large areas and are important in studies of crops, forestry, urban development, water resources, pollution control, hydrology, and many other aspects of ecological research. Experience has shown that high data processing speed is required for timely data reduction and application of the results. Techniques developed at The University of Michigan have solved the problem of keeping pace with the desired rate of recognizing objects in \"real-time.\" However, three additional problems have been identified: 1. Setting up a processor such as the Michigan Processor (SPARC) requires considerable time. This time needs to be reduced. 2. Determination of an \"optimum\" setup cannot be done quickly or practically using such a processor by itself. 3. On line modification of the processing rule to account for natural variation seems necessary and requires computation which cannot be performed with an analog machine. A solution to these problems is proposed and discussed in this report. Specifications for a design approach are presented for a prototype hybrid multi-spectral processor (SPARC/H) having high throughput capability. The approach is to add an interacting digital machine to the system and reconfigure the analog machine design to be compatible with the digital system. The strength of our approach lies in the fact that algorithms have been developed which make effective use of the particular capabilitles of the two computers working together on a highly interactive basis. Study is still required to modify and develop these algorithms further for the digital machine and to determine the effectiveness of the man-machine interface. Study and specification of the final configuration needed for operational use can be pursued using this system as a tool."
"In classifying multispectral, digitized, pictorial data it is necessary to locate spatial boundaries in the data to assist the researcher in the selection of training and test samples. Applications also exist in the areas of data compression, information storage and retrieval, sample classification schemes and image registration."
"The nature of information flow in arriving at optimal control signals is examined for decentralized linear dynamic systems with local and supervisory controllers. It is illustrated for problems with quadratic cost subject to terminal (target) state constraint. It is assumed that local controllers know only their own dynamics and subsystem state vectors and that the supervisory control knows the target state vector and the dynamic and control coupling terms that exist between the subsystems. It is further assumed that the controllers can exchange intermediate results of computations in deriving control laws for the decentralized systems."
"This paper discusses the application of sensitivity constrained optimal control theory to a dynamic model of the U.S. national economy as the foundation of a useful prescriptive macroeconomic model. Two optimal control policies are formulated and solved. The first, or primary optimal control problem, is constrained by system state dynamics only. The second, or sensitivity constrained optimal control problem, is constrained by economic state dynamics as well as state trajectory sensitivity to parameter deviations from nominal. Numerical results suggest that in general economic state trajectory sensitivity may be reduced by decreasing federal government purchases of goods and services and increasing the supply of money over their respective optimal levels when state sensitivity to parameter variations is not considered. Further, although state sensitivity may be reduced to an arbitrarily small level, it is relatively costly to do so using federal government spending and money supply as the control media."
"The problem of specifying an operating policy for a system of waste treatment plants is considered within the framework of modern control theory. The policy determines the percentage of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) which must be removed from each plant at each point in time and which minimizes the total operating costs in the system subject to penalty functions on the separation of the actual water quality from the stream standards. The system equations have been developed and the control law obtained for different types of penalty functions."
"Integral, nth order compensation in the feedforward loop of a unity feedback system is shown to result from quadratic, stochastic optimal control of a linear system with arbitrary step input and no error measurement noise. This gives agreement with common practice. Unfortunately this result is obtained only with nonzero compensator noise. It is shown that in the limit of zero compensator noise, the estimator produces a zero at the origin to cancel the effect of the integrator, negating the practical result. The conclusion is that this particular discrepancy between common practice and optimal control theory is still unresolved and that research effort should be expended on reconcilement in order to find the extension to time-variable, multivariable systems."
"In this paper, the optimal fixed configuration control of a linear stochastic system, having random parameters and an additive white noise input disturbance, is investigated. It is assumed that a noisy observation of the state is available. The observation is to be filtered, and the state of the filter used to control the stochastic system. The gains in the filter and control, the initial condition of the filter, and the pamameter specifying the filter dynamics, are to be selected so that optimal performance results subject to the constraint that the filter and control be a linear configuration. Optimal performance requires the minimization of the expected value of a quadratic performance criterion. A two point boundary value problem (TPBVP) is derived using the minimum principle, giving a set of necessary conditions for optimality. An important feature of the result is that when the filter and control gains are selected optimally, the selection of the filter dynamics is arbitrary. The optimization problem is singular with respect to one of the parameters of the filter which indicates a certain amount of freedom in the fixed configuration design. It should be noted that the control scheme proposed in this study must be considered suboptimal rather than optimal, since the linear configuration of the controller is specified prior to optimization. An example is included to illustrate application of the fixed configuration technique to the class of problems considered."
"This paper is concerned with the adaptive optimal control of processes whose dynamic characteristics are not completely specified but assumed to be varying slowly with time. It is shown that the identification procedure involves the evaluation of certain essential process characteristics, i.e. measurable differentials, without requiring the determination of the unknown process parameters. The process input and output functions are taken to be elements of Lp - spaces and the optimization procedure is briefly described. For any practical application of the identification algorithm the process output differentials are approximated by first order differences of output time segments, and their corresponding adjoints by retaining only a finite number of terms in an infinite series expression. Utilizing the techniques of Functional Analysis the LP - space convergence of these approximating algorithms is shown."
"This paper presents the preliminary studies of compensator growing from a frequency response point of view. Several definitions in regard to relative stability of a control system are made. Three theorems for helping to determine the necessary size of the compensator that should be employed for a specific system are stated and proved. Following these a technique for growing a compensator for increasing the relative stability of a control system is suggested. Last, an example illustrating this method is included."
"In this expository paper, several approaches to Adaptive Filtering are discussed. The different methods are divided into four categories of (i) Bayesian Methods, (ii) Maximum Likelihood Methods, (iii) Correlation Methods, and (iv) Covariance-Matching Methods. The relationship between the methods and the difficulties associated with each method are described. New algorithms for the direct estimation of the optimal gain of a Kalman filter are given."
"The topic of this paper is the simultaneous estimation of state and parameters in linear discrete-time dynamic systems. The system is subject to a known arbitrary input (control), a random input (additive driving noise) and the output observation is also contaminated by noise. The noises are Gaussian, zero-mean, independent and with known variances. The problem is formulated under the assumption that the system parameters are unknown constants. Previous works in the literature treated this problem assuming that each parameter can take values over a finite set with known a priori probabilities. The proposed scheme yields the maximum a posteriori and maximum likelihood estimates for the system's state and parameters, respectively. They are obtained by solving the likelihood equations-a system of nonlinear equations with the state and parameters as unknowns. Use is made of the fact that the dynamical system considered is linear and the problem is separated into two interconnected linear problems: one for the state, the other for the parameters. The solution is obtained by iterating between two systems of linear equations. The estimation technique presented is optimal in the following sense: no approximations are involved and the estimates of the parameters converge to the true values at the fastest possible rate, as given by the Cram�r-Rao lower bound, i.e. they are asympotically efficient. This is proved, using a theorem which states that, under certain general conditions, the maximum likelihood estimate with dependent observations is consistent and asymptotically efficient. The problem of uniqueness of the solution is discussed for the case of a scalar unknown parameter. Use is made of a theorem due to Perlman, generalized for the case of dependent observations. Due to the fact that the estimation-identification is done in the presence of input and output noise and an arbitrary known input, the procedure can be considered an on-line technique. Since estimates are available after each measurement, this estimationidentification procedure is suited for use in the adaptive control of unknown (or partially known) linear plants."
"Optimal structure and parameter adaptive estimators have been obtained for continuous as well as discrete data gaussian process models with linear dynamics. Specifically, the essentially nonlinear adaptive estimators are shown to be decomposable (partition theorem) into two parts, a linear non-adaptive part consisting of a bank of Kalman-Bucy filters, and a nonlinear part that incorporates the learning or adaptive nature of the estimator. The conditional-error-covariance matrix of the estimator is also obtained in a form suitable for on-line performance evaluation. The adaptive estimators are applied to the problem of state-estimation with nongaussian initial state and also to estimation under measurement uncertainty (joint detection-estimation). Examples are given of the application of the proposed adaptive estimators to structure and parameter adaptation indicating their applicability to practical engineering problems."
"A travelling wave tube amplifier such as those employed in FDM multiple access communication satellite repeaters is considered in this paper. The amplifier nonlinearity is assumed to follow an error-function characteristic and the AM-PM conversion is taken to be a quadratic function of the envelope of the input signal. A closed form expression, allowing for both arbitrary amounts of amplifier saturation and AM-PM conversion, is derived for the autocorrelation function of the amplifier output when the input is a Gaussian band-pass process."
"This paper describes the structure and the simulated performance of nonlinear adaptive filters appropriate for high speed serial data transmission over time-dispersive and slowly time-variant channels. The filters are designed to combat the two major obstacles in high speed digital signaling over such channels, namely, the presence of intersymbol interference due to the non-ideal frequency response of the channel and the slow, randomly time-variant response characteristics of the channel. Some results on the error rate performance of the adaptive filters, obtained by means of Monte Carlo computer simulation, are also presented."
"The Bayes optimal m-ary digital communication receiver structure is derived using a recursive formula from the theory of unsupervised learning pattern classification. The receiver structure is optimal for a model which includes intersymbol interference, Markov symbol and noise sequences, and unknown parameters. The optimum receiver is found as a function of the noise density. In the particular case of Gauss-Markov noise, the receiver is shown to consist of (1) discrete-time pre-whitening, (2) correlation, (3) energy correction, (4) expontiation, and (5) delay-feedback \"filtering\" followed by zero-memory linear operations and minimum selection."
"Communications and radar receivers of advanced design may utilize real time computers for signal processing. In such instances an adaptive learning scheme can be employed to optimize use of the receiver's dynamic range. An adaptive algorithm for statistically optimum AGC is derived in which the receiver gain is adjusted during the learning process so that the average cost of excluding the received signal from the receiver's dynamic range is minimized. Application of the approach to the frequently occurring situation of Rayleigh distributed signals of unknown strength yields a recursive algorithm which can be easily implemented."
"This paper is concerned with the behavior of an adaptive routing system in a large communications network. The adaptive routing algorithm described uses stochastic switching matrices to automatically find and complete the traffic paths through a system. A realistic network and traffic which were derived from military field exercises are used to illustrate the real time behavior of the algorithm. Simulation experiments indicate that adaptive routing techniques can be effective in large communications networks."
"Numerous studies dealing with computational techniques to solve optimal control problems result in what is commonly referred to as open-loop control. However, the control designer seeks closed-loop or automatic control in order to assure desirable system behavior in a variety of situations. This paper discusses some experimental results of preliminary studies for synthesizing automatic controllers for reasonably complex systems from optimum open-loop data."
"A study is made of the applicability of two direct search techniques to the problem of optimizing the performance of a system operating in a switching environment. The techniques are modified to extend their applicability in such environments. The methods considered are (1) the stochastic automaton method and (2) the adaptive random optimization method. Pattern recognition techniques are used to identify the state of the environment, and a separate search is performed for each state of the environment. Experimental results are presented to compare the convergence properties of the methods with pattern recognition with that of the stochastic automaton method without pattern recognition for several different switching rates."
"The problem model considered here is y(k+1) = A(k)y(k) + αG(k)w(k) (1) x(k) = ßy(k) (2) z(k) = ξC(k)x(k) + v(k) (3) where x(k) is a Gauss-Markov n vector, the state of the system, w(k), the plant noise vector, is a white gaussian m vector with known mean and variance, v(k) is the observation noise vector and is zero mean gaussian r vector, z(k) is the r vector of observation, A(k), G(k), and C(k) are known coefficient matrices, α, ß, and ξ are the sources of uncertainty for this model."
"This paper presents an analysis of an optimally controlled linear plant subjected to additive random distrubances and jump type parameter uncertainties. In practice, these jump type parameter uncertainties arise whenever the system goes through some sudden changes in the environmental conditions, or suffers a loss of some component in the plant and/or controller parameters. The dynamic behavior of the state covariance and control covariance matrices are studied following jump type uncertainties in the process parameters. It is shown that the state covariance matrix is the solution of a first-order matrix differential equation. As an example, theoretical and experimental results are obtained for the attitude control of a satellite tracking a stellar object and subjected to the following type of additive disturbing turques: (a) Gaussian white noise: (b) Gaussian colored noise, and (c) sinusoidal signals."
"Sequential search strategies for the determination of a minimum cost control alternative from a finite set in a stochastic environment are considered. The problem is equivalent to search of a \"hill of uncertainty\" in a decision space; any strategy defines a particular path descending the hill. Optimal decision strategies are identified for the two distinct cases of on-line or adaptive control, and off-line search."
"The Theory of Cooperative N-Person Stochastic Differential Games is shown to be applicable for solving a Multicriterion Stochastic Optimal Control Problem as a game without sidepayments and with equal information to each of the players. Utilizing the Mash-Harsanyi solution for such a game, a noninferior control law can be obtained as the solution to the Multicriterion Stochastic Optimal Control Problem. An example with linear dynamics and two quadratic criteria is solved completely. The validity of the Separation Principle to this class of problems is a direct consequence of the equal information restriction to each of the players."
"This paper presents some aspects of a special multimodality in a two-person game-renju (a Japanese alignment game on a board); the authors believe such a renju multimodality will surely be a new base of ideas and understanding of adaptive processes in artificial intelligence requiring multimodal optimum search. After introducing renju rules, and basic renju technical terms and strategies, this paper develops the necessary concepts such as distance between any two points, four directions, string, jumstring, costring, dead (jum-)string,and criterion function of a placed stone (piece or chip) on a renju board. The essential aspects of renju multimodality studied here are as follows: possible values of the criterion function, the realized number of the highest peak (lowest valley) formed by the criterion function within a game, height of maximum peak vs. the issue of the game, possible number of the highest peak (lowest valley), illustration of the criterion function, developing processes of peak and valley, adaptive mobility of the optimum point, and practical appearance of the multimodality of renju problems."
"A filter in a set is any device which passes or does not pass each element in a set. The action of a filter is the dichotomy (A,B) of the base set where A is the set of elements passed or accepted and B is the complement of A. This innocent appearing definition which I first stated in 1967 is both general and suggestive of many applications. In particular, I chose the definition by direct abstraction from the filters of chemistry, electronics, cigarettes, and air conditioning. If I should not have differentiated between the filter as a device and its action, then the concept would be reduced to the algebra of sets. In the next section I will give a number of examples of filters and a short summary of a rudimentary theory. Thereafter I proceed to discussions of an assortment of generalizations I have made in which filters as such will appear mainly to indicate that they are ubiquitous. I will however, concentrate on the concepts which I know to be of importance in general systems theories. My approach has not followed the lines of making mathematical models of systems but to study mathematics as a system. While I have many years of work staked on the utility of such an approach, I do not pretend to have demonstrated to the satisfaction of many that applications are indeed possible. The semantics of mathematics, while more circumscribed than that of languages is not to be trivially described even if we choose to ignore its dynamic aspects. Even such a seemingly simple distinction as the one between abstraction and generalization have been confused partially because of the reluctance to admit that a generalization embraces the specific concept generalized. For example all groups are semigroups (by a poor choice of terminology) and thus semigroups are a generalization of groups, not an abstraction. On the other hand semigroups may be defined by abstracting certain conditions required of groups and in this sense they are the result of an abstraction process."
 "This paper presents a general formalism for defining problems of adaptation. Within this formalism a class of algorithms, the sequential reproductive plans, is defined. It is then proved that sequential reproductive plans are robust in the sense that, in environments with a well-defined measure of payoff (utility, performance), any such plan will acquire payoff at a rate which asymptotically approaches the optimum."
"In the recognition of complex patterns it is becoming more apparent that segmentation (object isolation) and pattern classification cannot be performed by independent procedures. A pilot study is described which employs feedback to control the interaction of segmentation and segment classification in a system under development for automatic recognition of continuous speech. The potential advantages of employing such interaction in this work are discussed and data are presented which indicate that this approach is promising."
"A new method for registering pattern features in electronic templates has been devised which does not use error-correction routines. It is easy to train, does not require additional training when categories are added, and uses low-cost, reliable, binarystorage devices. Three experimental models have been developed and tested. The first, using fixed assignments of electronic templates to categories, is suitable for adapting to an arbitrary library of 16 words for one speaker at a time. The second, using an adaptive assignment of electronic templates to categories, is adaptable to several speakers simultaneously or to different languages. The third is a new system for connected-word recognition, using adaptive assignment of templates according to size."
"Pattern recognition concepts are investigated as a possible synthesis technique for an aircraft approach progress monitor. Some aircraft state variables are chosen as components of the pattern vector x which represents the state of the aircraft relative to a prescribed set of tolerances. A curve fitting algorithm is used as a method of solution for the required non-linear discriminant function, F(ϕ(x)) = 0. The resultant decision surface is considered to be an adjunct to the pilot's decision process. Simulation results are discussed which indicate a potential application for future system's design."
"Present techniques of analysis of electroencephalograms (EEGs) require the neurologist to visually scan long segments of the EEG in order to obtain some. diagnostic information. However, much of the information contained in the EEG is lost in the process, and other diagnostic methods are generally required to accurately detect cerebral disorders. The purpose of the study described in this paper is to apply signal processing, measure selection, and pattern recognition techniques to the EEG in order to devise a more accurate and safer method of diagnosis. A particular cerebral disorder, cerebrovascular insufficiency, was used as the basis for the investigation. The analysis of the EEGs can be divided into several stages: recording and digitizing the EEG, making measurements on the EEG, reducing the number of measures to a few representative factors, and analyzing with pattern recognition."
"A computer-aided classification algorithm is basically a procedure for clustering a large number of objects into subsets representing similar \"types.\" The cluster analysis technique is used to select objects which have similar characteristics and is distinct from such techniques as discriminant analysis and other more recently developed pattern recognition methods in the sense that it is not assumed a priori which objects belong to specific groups or what probability distributions characterize the different groups. The primary value of cluster analysis is in the classification of objects into \"natural\" groups as suggested by the data itself. This paper discusses recently developed approaches to three fundamental problems associated with the creation of computer-aided classification techniques for taxonomic studies of biological populations: 1) Data Characterization; 2) Clustering Procedure, and 3) Statistical Significance of Clustering Results, A brief presentation of biological applications is included."
"Minimal mean square error polynomial estimators are developed for time discrete systems. The estimation problem is formulated in Hilbert space with the optimal as the projection on the linear manifold generated by finite polynomials of the observer. The estimate is partitioned into a predictor and corrector where the corrector is expressed as the product of a weighting vector and residual. Methods of determing the residuals and the weighting vectors are developed. An example applying the techniques is included."
"A general representation for the Joint conditional probability density of an arbitrary random signal process under discrete-time observation is obtained. This representation forms the cornerstone of the paper, and from it all other results are deduced. The conditional densities of prediction and smoothing are expressed in terms of filtering via the application of the general representation. The prediction and smoothing of a random process with linear dynamics and arbitrary a priori distribution are given to illustrate the applicability of the previous results in obtaining effectively computable formulas."
"A sum of weighted gaussian probability density functions can be used to approximate another density function. This representation provides the basis for a procedure for computing the conditional density p(xk|zk) of the state xk of a nonlinear dynamical system given all available measurement data zk. As is well-known, estimates of the state xk for any performance criterion can be determined in a relatively straight forward manner if one has p(xk|zk). Consequently, knowledge of this density function essentiaUy constitutes a solution of the general nonlinear filtering problem."
"This paper compares the performance of several non-linear filters for the real-time estimation of the trajectory of a re-entry vehicle from its radar observations. In particular, it examines the effect of using two different coordinate systems on the relative accuracy of an Extended Kalman Filter. Other filters considered are Iterative-Sequential Filters, Single-Stage Iteration Filters and Second Order Filters. It is shown that a Range-Direction-Cosine Extended Kalman filter which uses the measurement coordinate system has less bias and less RMS error than a Cartesian Extended Kalman Filter which uses the Cartesian coordinate system. This is due to the fact that the observations are linear in the Range-Direction-Cosine coordinate system, but nonlinear in the Cartesian coordinate system. It is further shown that the performance of the Cartesian Iterative-Sequential Filter which successively relinearizes the observations around their latest estimates approaches that of a Range-Direction-Cosine Extended Kalman Filter. The use of a single-stage iteration to reduce the dynamic nonlinearity improves the accuracy of both the Extended Kalman filters, but the improvement over the Range-Direction-Cosine Extended Kalman Filter is very small indicating that the dynamic nonlinearity is less significant than the measurement nonlinearity in Re-entry Vehicle Tracking under the assumed data rates and measurement accuracies. The comparison amongst the nonlinear filters is carried out using ten sets of observations on two trajectories based on actual flight test data. The numerical results demonstrate that for RV tracking at normal data rates and normal measurement accuracies, the Range-Direction-Cosine Extended Kalman Filter performs better than other non-linear filters in terms of the trade-off between estimation accuracy, computation time and the radar energy."
"This paper shows that to a first approximation geological time observations do fit the specifications of an abstract mathematical model of Nobert Wiener and Aurel Wintner. As a result, geological time measurements have inherent random characteristics that under harmonic analysis yield a Cauchy spectral distribution."
"One of the problems in signal processing is estimating the impulse response function of an unknown system. The well-known Wiener filter theory has been a powerful method in attacking this problem. In comparison, the use of stochastic approximation method as an adaptive signal processor is relatively new. This adaptive scheme can often be described by a recursive equation in which the estimated impulse response parameters are adjusted according to the gradient of a pre-determined error function. This paper illustrates by means of simple examples the application of stochastic approximation method as a single-channel adaptive processor. Under some conditions the expected value of its weight sequence converges to the corresponding Wiener optimum filter when the least-mean-square (LMS) error criterion is used."
"Seismic signals in a band of frequencies near 1.0 Hz. can be detected from underground explosions and earthquakes at distances of several thousand kilometers. A stochastic model has been proposed to characterize observed signal variations within a Large Aperture Seismic Array (LASA). The model assumes that the observed signal spectrum at a seismometer is some average spectrum multiplied by a random gain and phase. Within a subarray (7 km. aperture) the mean value of the modulus squared of the random term is approximated by 1.0 +0.18 f2 where f is frequency in Hz. For sensors drawn from the full LASA (200 km. aperture) the value is 1.0 +2.0 f2. Two alternative methods for extracting spectral information above 1.0 Hz for discrimination between event types are compared. Beamforming spectra are obtained from the Fourier transform of the average received signal. An alternative incoherent processing method, spectraforming, is to calculate the average spectrum from individual seismometers. Both can be corrected for bias. It is demonstrated that although beamforming will give more noise rejection than spectraforming, that the latter can be superior in terms of output signal to noise ratio when input signal variations between sensors are large. Spectraforming may be of significant value for obtaining spectral information in the 1.0 - 3.0 Hz band for events with Richter magnitudes in the range 4.0 - 4.5. This magnitude range is of considerable current interest for the purpose of nuclear test detection and discrimination."
"A new class of algorithms for function minimization is presented. The new algorithm are based upon homogeneous functions rather than quadratic models. A consequence of this is that (n+2) step convergence is obtained on homogeneous functions. Preliminary numerical tests indicate that, on general functions, the algorithm is superior to the well known Fletcher and Powell method."
 "Two new numerical methods which may be used to calculate solutions to optimal control problems are developed. These methods involve guessing initial values for unknown Lagrange multipliers and a control sequence. They are similar to the successive sweep method in that Riccati equations are used to calculate Corrections to these guessed variables. They are however substantially different in other aspects. Two example problems, the Brachistachrone and an earth to Mars low thrust transfer are solved to illustrate the application of the methods."
"Two variants of the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell methods developed recently are presented in Refs. 1, 2, and 3 and reviewed in the following. The first of these is a projection version tailored to nonlinear constraints, while the second is a version of the algorithm suitable for unconstrained problems (or with constraints handled via penalty function) which makes do with a coarse one-dimensional search without losing conjugacy."
 "Sensitivity of a posteriori statistics with respect to a change in a priori statistics in a minimum variance filter is investigated. Analytical expressions for the sensitivity are derived by means of a Green's function and an auxiliary function."
"The problem of estimating time varying parameters when the dynamics of the time variation is incompletely specified is considered. A stochastic approximation algorithm is given that yields estimates that are consistent in mean square. Rates of convergence are derived and an application to a class of polynomial regression problems is given."
"This paper presents the use of maximum likelihood estimation, optimization theory, and discrete invariant imbedding in the development of algorithms for the maximum likelihood estimation of bias coefficients in discrete linear systems with stochastic inputs and disturbances."
"The differential equations describing a large class of biological and biochemical control systems are examined from the point of view of stability using the following methods: The stability properties of the equations transformed to the Lur'e canonical form are examined by methods based on the second Lyapunov method. These results illustrate that sustained concentration oscillations cannot arise in a second order chemical systems involving negative feedback and otherwise first order rate laws. For such systems involving feedback that is not purely negative, and for third and higher order chemical systems involving negative feedback, it is possible for limit cycles to arise. Phase-plane methods indicate that limit cycle behavior cannot arise in chemical control Systems involving negative feedback and two components if the rate law for the uninhibited step is described by first order kinetics, a rectangular hyperbola, or a sigmoidal relationship. Linear methods indicate that the potential for instabilities is always present in the case of chemical systems involving positive feedback, the potential for instability and limit cycle behavior increases each time the order of the differential equations describing the system is increased. Digital simulation of the equations illustrate that limit cycles can arise in multi-component chemical systems involving negative feedback even if the rate laws for the uninhibited steps are linear. A mapping of the range of values of the constants in the equations indicates that there is a definite range for which sustained concentration oscillations arise. Finally, the possibility of multiple stationary states arising in biochemical and biological control systems is discussed. Eleven different cases are considered, and examples illustrating the temporal and phase-plane behavior of actual systems involving multiple stationary states are presented. It is illustrated, for example, that the addition of a little positive feedback to an otherwise purely negative chemical feedback system imparts stability to stationary states are presented. It is illustrated, for example, that the addition of a little positive feedback to an otherwise purely negative chemical feedback system imparts stability to stationary states for the system."
 "In highly complex metabolic systems, composed of interlocking and overlapping biosynthetic and degradative pathways, the control of certain strategic enzyme activities is more critical to the maintenance of fine balance between the various metabolic functions than is the control of others. The overall regulatory plan of such pathways depend largely on the nature of the biochemical reactions, the extent of branching as well as the physiological requirements of the given organism. It is now recognized that various different kinds of feedback control mechanisms have been evolved in order to accommodate the regulation of such divergent pathways; the specific control characteristics of regulatory enzymes determine the desired regulatory patterns."
"This paper analyzes a spatially periodic phenomenon in the fungus Nectria Cinnabarina, first reported by Bourret, Lincoln, and Carpenter1. This is the apparently random occurrence of discrete alternative morphologies in the mycelium of Nectria when growth begins from a point-innoculum on agar. These morphologies are topologically distinct zonation patterns of conidiating (sporulating) hyphae, including concentric closed rings, a single spiral, a pair of disjoint but parallel spirals, and \"intermediate\" cases Involving one or more radial dislocations. The phenomenon is redescribed in terms of a mapping of the unit circle into itself, to facilitate a speculative interpretation of its origin. This interpretation rests on the conjecture that the growing hyphae of Nectria harbor a self-exciting cytochemical oscillation which influences the induction of embryonic cells to a nonsporulating maturity."
"Cooperative effects in the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin have been known and studied for some time. The degree of cooperativity is reflected in the S or sigmoid saturation curve (i.e. percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen) showing that the binding of a few oxygen molecules favours the binding of more and that binding occurs best at high oxygen concentrations."
"The probability distribution and moments of the random variable max0 ≤ t ≤ T[Y(t)-E(Y(t)] are determined where Y(t) is an integral of a nonstationary Gaussian process obeying a stochastic dfferential equation. Some applications of the results are given."
"The spectral factorization in discrete systems is studied in this paper. Three theorems describing the solution and its characteristics are presented. A computer program incorporating this technique is applied to the orbit determination problem using the ranging system."
"A generalized method is presented for the solution of Fredholm and Wiener-Hopf integral equations using the theory of distributions. By separating the integral through determination of the limits of integration, bounded linear differential operators may be defined which reduce the integral equation problem to one of solving a distributional differential equation. These operators may then be combined to give an equation defining the desired unknown function. This method has the advantage that it is applicable to equations which contain nonstationary kernels or stationary rational or nonrational kernels independent of any assumption concerning separability of the kernel. The only assumption made is that the operators exist. The technique is applied to some specific problems and the results are shown to be the same as those obtained by other authors."
"In the past decade, stochastic approximation procedures have influenced the design of systems in a variety of system theory applications. These applications are characterized by an uncertainty in the a priori knowledge of the environment in which the system must operate. Howeer, it has been assumed that the environment either is statistically stationary or evolves in a known fashion. In this study a modification of the Robbins-Monro procedure is considered for two classes of unknown nonstationaries. Asymptotic properties of the procedure are considered for both classes of nonstationarities."
 "One of the most difficult problem areas encountered in advanced avionic systems is the verification by testing that the delivered product meets the agreed-to and specified design requirements. In a majority of cases, the details and the criteria, by which seller will assure buyer that the product meets the design commitments, are left to be defined after contract award. This invariably leads to disagreements between buyer and seller, which are settled only after long, costly negotiations. In recent System developments, the \"What is to be tested\" question has been properly addressed by including a Verification Cross Reference Index in the back of the specification. This matrix and proper description in the Quality Assurance section of the procurement specification will identify which design requirements must be tested and the type of test required (i. e., qualification testing, acceptance testing, analysis, etc). What has often been overlooked in the past is a clear definition of buyer/seller risk, sample size requirements for critical parameters, and the general question of . . . What test design is adequate on a critical parameter to demonstrate specification compliance? This paper proposes a solution to that question for those parameters, critical to the accuracy of the system, which have performance specified by RMS values. The concept presented could, with proper mathematical changes, be extended to any set of other parameters. The key idea is to specify, in the procurement specification, the criteria by which critical parameters will be verified. This paper presents a statistical technique, the results of which may be placed in a procurement specification, to establish an equitable buyer/seller risk on parameters critical to system performance. The technique is designed to adapt the acceptance requirement to the actual manufacturing process in a manner which allows the seller maximum flexibility without affecting the buyer's risk. Procedures and example curves for implementation are presented. A technique is presented in this paper which uses ensemble test data to refine initial assumptions and has as its primary goal that the real buyer and seller risks be as equal as possible at the conclusion of the production contract. In this paper, the real buyer's risk is . . . Given that systems with true performance in excess of the contractual specification are manufactured, what is the cumulative probability of these systems being accepted? In a like manner, the real seller's risk is . . . Given that systems with performance equal to or better than the contractual specification are manufactured, what is the cumulative probability of these systems being rejected? As will be shown later in this paper, the proposed test is fair to the seller, since, in the long run, he is guaranteed of selling a system for every system he builds (tests) which has performance as good as or better than contractual requirements. The technique is also fair to the buyer since the ensemble of systems he actually buys will perform better than the specification requirement. The technique presented could also allow the control of other criteria. One of the most prominent of these other criteria would be assurance that at the completion of the production program, the RMS performance capability of the ensemble of delivered systems is at least as good as the RMS performance requirement in the procurement specification. Indeed, there are many other such concepts. However, the writer believes that the concept of true, equal buyer/seller risk has the most appeal, since it tends to suppress the buyer's fear of \"dog systems\" while retaining a fairness in yield ratio for the seller. Accordingly, this paper will address itself only to the concept of equality of buyer and seller's risk as defined above. In the pursuit of this or any other concept involving the design of an acceptance test, it must be noted that the procurement specification requires performance over the time and environmental conditions. The acceptance test is conducted, in almost all cases, on new equipment and in a relatively benign environment. Accordingly, the test design must transform the RMS value in the procurement specification to a smaller RMS value which is appropriate to the environment and the newness of the equipment at time of test. This may be done by detailed analysis, or simply by reduction by an arbitrary percentage. It is suggested that, if the principles presented in this paper were incorporated into the verification or quality assurance section of the procurement specification at the time of contract bidding, the numerous and bitter arguments concerning acceptance test requirements which usually arise after contract award would be avoided. In addition, contracts could be bid with reasonable knowledge of yield factors; and contracts could be awarded with reasonably firm knowledge of what will end up in the field."

"A detailed study is presented of the economics of conventional underground transmission lines utilizing oil-paper insulated pipe-type cables. Three cryogenic ac transmission lines, cooled, respectively, by nitrogen, hydrogen, and helium, are compared with conventional cables and overhead lines. The nitrogen-cooled system, so far the most simple form of cryogenic cable proposed, is found to be the most attractive from the point of view of low-cost underground transmission."
"This paper outlines the design of a rigid underground line for transmitting electrical energy with tubular aluminum conductors cooled internally by liquid nitrogen and supported on suitable dielectric spacers in high-voltage vacuum insulation. The installed cost of a specific line with terminations and refrigerators has been estimated and found to be easily competitive with oil- paper insulated pipe-type cables of ratings in excess of 1000 MVA and in the voltage classes 138, 230, and 345 kV. It is shown that the nitrogen-cooled cable has great operating flexibility in so far that it may be adapted to long-term load growth, emergency over- loads, and repetitive load fluctuations of daily, weekly, and seasonal cycles. The first commercial installation, it is argued, may come into service before 1975."
"A 345-kV underground transmission system using isolated-phase construction, with concentric aluminum tubes insulated with sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) gas is described. A 600- foot (183-meter) long three-phase installation of this type made late in 1969 at Consolidated Edison's Buchanan substation, on the tie between the Keystone 500-kV system and the New York-New England 345-kV grid is discussed. The link will be capable of carrying 2000 MW in a single trench, backfilled around the enclosures with sand having relatively low thermal resistivity at low moisture levels."
"Controllable parameters in a power system include generator terminal voltage, generator input power, and network admittances. These parameters can be controlled to damp mechanical rotor oscillation in the generators and thereby improve system transient stability. Explicit equations are derived for the control of these parameters to introduce damping uniformly throughout a large power system. These equations are derived on the basis of minimizing a positive definite error function. Decision functions are included which inhibit damping action when it leads to system instability. This method can be used to coordinate the application of locally based damping techniques."
"The utilization of a quantitative reliability criterion in long range transmission planning is proposed. The application of a conditional probability approach the determination of load point reliability indices in practical systems is discussed and illustrated by a simple hypothetical system study. Failure at a bus is defined by three planning criteria and the reliability level obtained in terms of a probability and an expected frequency of bus failure. The method requires ac load flow analysis at several load levels under possible system component outages. The technique is quite general, and any known operating conditions can be included. Planning based on acceptable load bus reliability levels results in optimum utilization of the investment placed in transmission facilities."
"An evaluation is made of the effectiveness of a dynamically responsive dc line in improving the steady-state and transient stability of a power system. A control system, incorporated into the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) 700-kW model, is described. Studies also reported compare the performance of a simple system consisting of two ac transmission lines with the same system when one of the ac lines is replaced by an equivalent dc line."
"In advance of the integrated voltage and reactive power control in a power system, it is necessary to determine an appropriate reference operating voltage, that is, the desired operating values at generating plants and substations. The reference operating voltage used so far, determined mainly from experience, cannot be said to be reasonable. A newly developed method to determine the appropriate reference operating voltage and also a machine computation program is described in detail. In addition, the results of applying these methods and programs to a model power system are also mentioned."
"In recent years important research has been done in the area of system optimization by control engineers. Many theoretical results have been published but application examples have mainly been on low-order systems. An attempt is made to apply a certain class of optimal control theory, known as the state regulator problem, to obtain an optimal controller to improve the dynamic response of a power system. The system differential equations are written in the first-order state variable form. A cost functional is then chosen, and the matrix Riccati equation is solved. Puri's and Gruver's method is applied for the numerical computation, and the system is made initially stable by shifting the system eigenvalues."
"The electric power system in Japan has been getting complicated and will continue to grow in the future. Along with the modernization of other industries, there is still a further need for the improvement of the service quality of electric power supplies. It is generally recognized that the conventional manual system operation or local system control has reached its technical limits. For this reason, the present days' emergent need is to establish an automatic load dispatching system including a central control computer capable of performing integrated system operation. The power system simulator has been designed and constructed to solve a variety of technical problems associated with integrated system operation. The design conception and specifications of the power system simulator is described briefly. An outline of several research programs presently under development is also included."
"A method of including mutual couplings in the zero- sequence Z matrix described by Riaz [1] has been adapted for use in single-phase-to-ground short-circuit studies of large power systems. The algorithm of this extension is detailed, and the computational advantages over earlier methods [2]-[4] are pointed out."
"A recent paper [1] introduced a load-flow method based on the minimization of a function made up of the sum of the squares of the load-flow equations. The Fletcher-Powell method, which was used to perform the minimization, becomes very inefficient for large systems. Large systems require excessive core and prohibitive computer time. This limits the method's applicability to systems of not more than about 50 nodes. This paper presents a decomposition technique that can be used in conjunction with the Fletcher-Powell method to extend the application of the nonlinear programming method to large systems. The method makes very efficient use of computer storage and has been found to reduce computation time by a factor of 90 percent for a 57-bus system. Results of the IEEE 14-, 30-, 57-, and 118-bus systems are given. The computer program that has been written can handle systems of 500 nodes without external storage."

"A set of differential equations describing the dynamics of the transmission system and connected machines, including the voltage regulators and governors, is formed. The terms of these equations are divided into two groups, the linear terms and the nonlinear terms. The solution of the set of equations as a function of time can then be expressed as a function of the exponential of the matrix formed by the linear terms and an integral. The advantages and disadvantages of this method of approach for solving the transient stability problem on a digital computer are discussed."
"A new method is given for digitally modeling the frequency dependence of the line parameters for an overhead transmission line. Using Fourier transforms, the method models only the line characteristics, leaving the terminations to be chosen by the user. The model of the frequency-dependent line is embedded in a general purpose electromagnetic transients program providing the user with a wide choice of termination and excitation conditions. The method promises to be accurate, and provides insight into the propagation of the aerial and ground modes of transmission. A comparison of line modeling using the method of characteristics, π equivalents, and frequency-dependent line parameters is given. Although the frequency dependence has been implemented for only one two-phase line, the method is general in principle."
"This paper discusses the mathematical representation of a dc transmission system and its controls. Presented for comparison are digital computer study results of the same studies performed on an intermediate power level model of a parallel ac/dc transmission system. Also presented are the mathematical representations of the several ac components of the model system."
"In studying transient performance of power systems, large computer programs are now used with representation of individual unit governing systems included. Detailed representation of hydrogovernors is not usually available, but, rather, an equivalent transfer function is employed."
"Planning the expansion of a high-voltage transmission system involves deciding which new lines will enable the system to satisfy forthcoming loads with the required degree of reliability. Since these decisions involve considerable investment and operating costs, the planner will wish to keep the present worth of all costs as low as possible. The difficulties of the problem come from the tremendous number of possible alternatives, the need to make the best use of information about future loads, and the complexity of the reliability constraints: The outages of some specific combinations of lines (highest capacity lines among them, perhaps) must not at any time overload any other line in the system. A new computational procedure for system planning is presented; this procedure combines and optimizes the formerly separate computations of load flow, reliability analysis, and economic evaluation. This procedure has been applied successfully to a 17-node system studied by the Bonneville Power Administration."
"The static state of an electric power system is defined as the vector of the voltage magnitudes and angles at all network buses. The static-state estimator is a data processing algorithm far converting redundant meter readings and other available information into an estimate of the static-state vector. Discussions center on the general nature of the problem, mathematical modeling, an interative technique for calculating the state estimate, and concepts underlying the detection and identification of modeling errors. Problems of interconnected systems are considered. Results of some initial computer simulation tests are discussed."
"The static state of an electric power system is defined as the vector of the voltage magnitudes and angles at all network buses. The static-state estimator is a data-processing algorithm for converting redundant meter readings and other available information into an estimate of the static-state vector. Discussions center on an approximate mathematical model (related to the dc load-flow model). This model yields noniterative-state estimation equations, simplified prediction of effects of network and generation-load pattern changes on network flow, and simplified detection and identification of modeling errors. Results of some initial computer studies on the real power-voltage angle portion of the approximate model are discussed."
"The static state of an electric power system is defined as the vector of the voltage magnitudes and angles at all network buses. The static-state estimator is a data processing algorithm for converting redundant meter readings and other available information into an estimate of the static-state vector. Discussions center on implementation problems associated with computation time requirements, dimensionality resulting from a large number of buses, and the actual time-varying (nonstatic) character of power systems. Various potentially useful approaches are discussed and compared."
"A fixed-point formulation is used to show that the Gauss-Seidel procedure and the Newton method for solving load- flow problems are similar successive-approximation methods differing only slightly in the form of their iteration functions. The added insight gained by this fixed-point formulation shows that the range of the Gauss-Seidel procedure is severely limited, and why convergence takes many iterations. A modified Newton method is also presented which eliminates the repeated inversion of the Jacobian matrix, as required by the regular Newton method. A combination of the regular and modified Newton methods seems warranted. A theorem giving sufficient criteria to guarantee convergence of both the regular and modified Newton methods is included. The theorem also contains error bounds for both methods. Tests of these concepts on the Ward and Hale six-bus system are included."
"This is a concise critical survey of the theory and practice relating to the ordered Gaussian elimination on sparse systems. A new method of renumbering by clusters is developed, and its properties described. By establishing a correspondence between matrix patterns and directed graphs, a sequential binary partition is used to decompose the nodes of a graph into clusters. By appropriate ordering of the nodes within each cluster and by selecting clusters, one at a time, both optimal ordering and a useful form of matrix banding are achieved. Some results pertaining to the compatibility between optimal ordering for sparsity and the usual pivoting for numerical accuracy are included."
"It is shown that sparsity programming is no more than a substitution of a higher level microcompiler for a basic microcompiler in the storage retrieval and processing involving elements of linear and multidimensional arrays. The substitution property of microcompilers permits the coding of a program first in a natural language using formal subscripts and then converting the conventional coding into a sparsity coding after the conventional coding has been fully debugged. This two-stage process not only preserves coding efficiency but also will generally shorten the overall program debugging time. It additionally provides for division of labor between the conventional coder and the sparsity coder. A formal list structuring strategy which has built-in \"garbage collection\" for sparsity programming is described in detail. This strategy constitutes a conversion guide from conventional to sparsity programming."
"The determination of the least costly long-term expansion of a power system in the presence of uncertainty about future loads is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem. It is recognized that more information about these future loads will be acquired with time. The objective is to find an expansion policy such that the investment decision is based on an up-to-date estimate of the system requirements."

"During and since the preparation of [2] and [3], many field investigations concerning transmission line switching surges have been conducted. These have obtained experimental surge data on modern high-voltage transmission lines and configurations using modern circuit breakers with various means of switching surge control. It is one of the purposes of this paper to summarize and evaluate these field results. Additional purposes are enumerated."
"Withstand and flashover test data are presented for five types of insulators tested by the clean fog method and the wet contaminant method. The insulators were contaminated with a slurry having the proportions of 1 liter of water, 20 grams of Cab-O- Sil, 1 gram of Photo-Flo, and various quantities of salt to obtain the desired conductivities. The present data are also compared with those obtained by other investigators."
"Accuracy of measurement of corona magnitude depends on the use of a calibrator to produce a stepwave that simulates the corona transient. The maximum permissible rise time, the minimum permissible decay time, and the minimum permissible repetition period have, been established by calculation and confirmed by experiment. The results may be used for drafting specifications for corona calibrators."
"Consideration is given to corona tests on finished cable by means of general-purpose corona detectors working on detection frequencies below 1 MHz. It is shown that errors due to the superposition of direct and reflected corona transients can be substantial. Results of an experimental examination of superposition errors, and methods for their elimination or control are described. Circuit transformations by which a corona detector may be matched to a cable are outlined. A critierion is provided for the greatest length of cable that may be regarded as lumped capacitance and so tested in the normal way. A calibration procedure is outlined by which measurements may be corrected for the effects of cable attenuation and the test circuit configuration. The sensitivity to be expected is indicated."
"A digital computer program for the calculation of switching and lightning surges on three-phase power systems is presented. It is designed for fast operation, statistical processing of results, and high versatility in network representation. Network elements can be symmetrical or asymmetrical, linear or nonlinear. Transmission lines can be transposed or nontransposed and may have frequency-dependent damping."
"This paper and a companion paper [7] develop the digital-computer techniques for the dynamic representation of HVDC power links. A digital-computer program is developed which may represent many circuit configurations, different modes of control, and protective devices, and provides a model which offers both accuracy and flexibility. The formation of a mathematical model which represents the converters and their associated ac systems by differential, algebraic, and Boolean equations is described. The requirements of a computer calculation have been born in mind during the construction of this mathematical model. A new topological technique for the representation of converters is introduced. This technique overcomes the problems of representing the discrete switching processes which occur in converter operation. The utilization of tensor analysis and diakoptics facilitates the construction of a flexible mathematical model of the complete systems of multiconverter stations and associated ac circuitry. The techniques presented are specifically designed for the dynamic simulation of HVDC systems; however the theory may be applied to other circuit prolems where switching processes occur."
"The digital-computer techniques for the dynamic representation of HVDC power links are discussed. A digital-computer program is developed which may represent many circuit configurations, different modes of control, and protective devices. It also provides a model which offers both accuracy and flexibility. The way the mathematical model of a complex electric system which includes numerous switching processes and discontinuities may be programmed for a digital computer is discussed. In addition, methods for optimizing program storage and computer time are described. Selected test studies are also presented. The program developed enables a flexible and accurate simulation of HVDC systems operating normally or under fault conditions. The resulting program will be a highly efficient analytical tool for the system design engineer."
"Three methods to calculate the current distribution, both in magnitude and phase, throughout the cross section of a single-turn coil are presented. The methods are analytical for computer computations in that exact solutions would be obtained if round-off errors could be avoided completely. The numerical procedure, which solves the resulting matrix system equation, common to all three solutions, is discussed. It provides a numerically stable solution by separating the complex matrix equation into two real matrix equations, namely, the real and imaginary parts."
"A new measure of the relative transient stability of a multimachine power system based on the Lyapunov stability theory is introduced. Techniques of sensitivity analysis are used to determine numerically the influence of variations or errors in the estimation of the system parameters on the transient stability of a power system. In particular, data is presented for an application of these ideas to a one machine infinite bus system."
"The set of all possible electrical states of a network is modeled using linear algebra and group theory. The model which is the multidimensional linear space is established, described, and verified. The formulas are derived making possible numerical calculations and network analysis. All possible methods of network solution are modeled and discussed using linear transformation theory. The degree of freedom of a network is defined and described. Finally, the classification of networks is proposed as far as topological structures and methods of solution are concerned. The theory developed makes possible a more general approach and solution to power system problems."
"Surge protection of underground systems supplied from overhead circuits requires careful consideration of many variables. This paper consolidates the various philosophies of underground system protection, placing these considerations and principles in perspective. No attempt is made to present new concepts, this having been done by other authors."
"The development of an elementary computer program package which can be used to predict the availability of a theoretical radial underground-distribution circuit from the substation to the home is described. The calculations are based on input values of outage rates and times required to perform specific functions. The programs are applied to circuit configurations with various combinations of fault indicators, fault current interrupters, manual sectionalizing points, and manual and automatic tie-point equipment on the main and lateral circuits. Illustrative results show the effect of variation in these items as well as in the basic circuit configuration and operating procedures."
"This paper discusses the audio frequency noise induced in telephone lines by nearby electric power circuits, particularly when the power and telephone companies employ joint buried construction methods. The electrical protection considerations of this type of construction are not included in this paper. Comparisons are made with the usual aerial type of joint construction. The factors controlling the amount of interference produced by inductive influence are described and evaluated. Recommendations are suggested for limiting this interference to acceptable levels for satisfactory telephone service."
"This paper describes the design and installation of a completely instrumented underground distribution system in Coral Springs, Fla. This cooperative project by Florida Power and Light Company, Coral Ridge Properties, Inc., and Westinghouse Electric Corporation provides a means for evaluating new techniques and devices for improving the reliability, appearance, and economics of underground distribution systems under actual service conditions."
"Test performance of the primary terminator is described, and an analysis of fault-closure capability and load-break life is presented. It has been determined that fault-closure performance is a function of 1) instantaneous voltage at the point of closure, 2) speed of closure, and 3) condition of insulating surfaces separating the male and female contacts."
"There is a growing need for each utility to gain a thorough knowledge of the soil thermal resistivity throughout its system. The volume of heavily loaded multiduct runs of power cables promises to increase rapidly in the years ahead. We can no longer afford to plan for cable loadings based purely on an assumed soil thermal resistivity. Rather, we must compile information that accurately describes the thermal resistivity of soils commonly found within specific geographic areas; then very realistic values of soil thermal resistivity can be used in the planning of new underground systems in these areas."
"This paper describes the test installation, its operation, and the intermediate results of a continuous test program of synthetic-insulated 69-kV underground cables and joints, and terminations."
"Olefinic copolymers heavily loaded with high-structure conductive carbon black, used as conductor and core screens for primary feeders in underground distribution are discussed. These materials may be either thermoplastic or cross linked. Electrical and mechanical characteristics of these compounds and the manner in which they are affected by the type of base resin and by the type and quantity of carbon black are reviewed. The process of electrical conduction through the boundary layer and through the body of the compound is treated in some detail. Processability is an important consideration and orientation induced by the extrusion process can lead to anisotropic electrical properties. Reference is made to the influence of various environments which the cable may encounter in service. The value of resistivity required in cable constructions is also briefly discussed. Attention is drawn to the need for a specification of the required performance of a resistive compound. It is also recommended that cables using these types of covering that have been in service for a number of years should be examined to study the changes in properties that may have occurred."
"A composite model for multireservoir hydroelectric power systems is constructed for studying the monthly decision conceming total hydrogeneration. This is an important decision when the inflows are uncertain and when hydro, with zero marginal cost, can be used not only to satisfy firm load commitments but also to displace other firm resources or to serve secondary loads. In such a case, the tradeoff between savings at the present and expected benefits in the future is determined mainly by the total hydrogeneration. The construction of a composite representation for the multireservoir hydroelectric power system in the Pacific Northwest is described. The composite model is based on a single measure \"potential energy\" which is indicative of the system's generating capability. This results in a one-dam representation of the multireservoir system which, in effect, receives, stores, and releases potential energy, in a statistical model for the potential energy inflow and in a generation function which relates potential energy released to actual electric power generated. It has applications in the study of different operating policies, market structures, and investment programs through simulation or optimization. As an example, it is used to obtain the net operating revenues as a function of the excess thermal in the system."
"For a large hydroelectric power system, such as that of the Pacific Northwest, an important operational decision each month is the amount of hydrogeneration. This decision is important because the inflow of the water is uncertain while hydro, with zero marginal cost, can be used not only to satisfy firm load commitments, but also to displace other firm resources or to serve secondary loads. In such a case, the tradeoff between savings at the present and expected benefits in the future is determined mainly by the total hydrogeneration. The use of a composite representation of multireservoir hydroelectric power systems to determine the optimal monthly total hydrogeneration is described. The analytical tool employed is that of stochastic dynamic programming, and the statistical model for the streamflow prediction is based on previous flows and snowpack information. For the anticipated 1975 system in the Pacific Northwest, comparison between the optimal operation introduced here and the presently used rule-curve operation indicates that substantial savings may be obtained, mainly owing to the more uniform displacement of the high marginal cost thermal resources by hydrogeneration."
"The problems of measurement of networks which remain energized by ac power during measurement are discussed. Particular attention is given to methods which permit continuous measurement with the aim of recording directly temperature rise as determined by the change of resistance. Deflection methods, as well as potentiometric and bridge methods, are treated, and their relative advantages in accuracy, convenience, cost, and complexity are considered. Results of heat runs on a 1/2-hp split-phase motor, a 3 kVA single-phase loaded transformer, and a 100-kVA three- phase transformer are included."

"State estimation is a digital processing scheme which provides a real-time data base for many of the central control and dispatch functions in a power system. The estimator processes the imperfect information available and produces the best possible estimate of the true state of the system. The basic theory and computational requirements of static state estimation are presented, and their impact on the evolution of the data-acquisition, data- processing, and control subsystems are discussed. The feasibility of this technique is demonstrated on network examples."
"State estimation is a digital processing scheme which provides a real-time data base for many of the central control and dispatch functions in a power system. Its purpose is to permit improvements in system security and data accuracy and to reduce measurement and telemetry cost. The on-line implementation of an efficient state-estimator algorithm is discussed, and its feasibility is demonstrated on a 400-node network. The main motivations for and potential applications of on-line state estimation are listed, and the tradeoffs between measurement, estimation, and on-line load- flow computation are briefly discussed."
"A computer program that calculates the steady-state voltages, phase angles, and shaft phases from measured power flows has been written. The weighted difference between measured power flows and computed power flows was a scalar error that was minimized using a modified Newton's method and a second-order method. The admittance matrix was revised following a system change, and the changes in shaft phases were calculated for control purposes. In the event that the power flows were not balanced or the system was unstable, optimum spinning reserve allocation and load shedding was calculated. New algorithms for fast ac load flows were developed."
"This paper presents a simplified method of using elevated- temperature creep data in sag-tension calculations. A time- temperature prediction model for the line and data obtained from laboratory elevated-temperature creep tests are the only data required in addition to standard stress-strain and creep data."
"The prime objective is to develop a comprehensive and explicit method for computing the current-carrying capacity for either bare, covered, or iced aerial conductors. There have been many methods devised to compute ampacities. Moreover these methods are often quite involved and require the use of computers for their solution. The nomographic process encompasses more complex situations. It operates on the complicated nature of these formulations in a manner that reduces their complexity to a simple, accurate, and hence efficient system of computation. Intentionally, there is a vast amount of versatility built into this procedure whereby many ampacity-related parameters, for example, conductor temperature or wind velocity, may be computed easily and quickly. This development is designed to assist the reader in exploring the complete panorama of parameters or variables that manifest themselves in the science of current rating rather than in portraying a procedure needed to compute only ampere values. Furthermore, it is intended that computer programs would be used to solve problems involving a multitude of conductor sizes and/or ambient conditions, whereas the nomographic approach would, in essence, provide an analytical tool that can be drawn upon for the purposes of solving isolated ampacity problems."
"A method of designing steel piles for transmission towers using published theories for uplift and lateral loads is presented. Allowable horizontal deflection is not considered; however, with an adequate factor of safety applied to the ultimate lateral pile load, the horizontal deflection could be within tolerable limits for transmission tower foundations. Combined uplift and lateral load analysis indicate that the uplift resistance is increased by lateral loads. Although the lateral load of a battered pile is increased due to the batter, it is recommended that this increase be regarded as an additional safety factor for the commonly used batters."
"The results of a series of tests on three different AWG sizes of bare seven-strand AAAC (6201) conductors and bare 6/1 ACSR conductors are outlined. Since arc-fault characteristics have not been subjected to rigorous engineering analysis, an experimental investigation was required to determine how such conductors reacted to arc faults of various intensities. Investigation revealed that the AAAC (6201) and 6/1 ACSR conductors were equivalent in their resistance to arcing faults. In addition, we found that hot-spot temperatures resulted from severed strands. The hot-spot temperatures that developed in the 6/1 ACSR conductors were significantly higher than those developed in the seven-strand AAAC (6201) conductors when these conductors carried equal steady-state current."
"The power arc behavior on HV insulator strings is studied with regard to both the testing procedures and the design of guard devices. More precisely, the paper discusses the problems of firing the arc with an impulse or a fuse wire and the importance of the symmetry conditions of the supply and the return circuit in order to obtain reproducible and representative tests. The consequences of such testing procedures in the design of HV transmission lines are shown in some typical cases, that is, for vertical and for V- insulator strings."
"A statistical insulation performance analysis of the Bonneville Power Administration's 500-kV delta tower is described. Emphasis is placed on establishing a design philosophy and a design procedure that will provide a means of converting quantitative performance criteria to tower dimensions. Insulation requirements for switching surges and for 60-Hz voltages during extreme wind conditions have been given particular attention. The selection of balances performance criteria in the context of overall system reliability is discussed."
"Switching surge voltage tests were conducted on 280- by 170-mm standard-type disk insulator strings, and on 320-by 170- mm deep-rib-type disk insulator strings of 3.5 to 7.5 meters in length, under artificially polluted conditions."
"Long time measurements on rod gaps are described. The statistical evaluation of results is followed by the extraction of the influence of air humidity upon two waves in the region of minimum flashover voltages. The corrections decrease with increasing spacing of gaps in a way similar to the corrections for air densities. Therefore, the IEC correction can be applied only for spacing below 1.5 meters. No substantial difference between rod-plane and rod-rod spark gap for positive waves has been observed. About 250 S curves have been evaluated."
"The present philosophy in the selection of phase-to- phase clearances has been examined. On the basis of a number of oscillograms of switching surges in an EHV system, some characteristics of the overvoltage stresses between phases that have not been considered by the interphase testing methods adopted up to now are demonstrated. By means of a series of switching impulse laboratory tests, it has been shown that these characteristics of thephase-to- phase overvoltages cannot be overlooked in assessing the dielectric strength of phase-to-phase air-insulated structures of substations."
"The results of dry positive-polarity switching impulse tests on a 4-meter rod-plane gap are reported. The tests were performed using two different shapes for the front of the impulse applied: one shape consisted of the \"smooth\" front commonly used in switching impulse tests; the second shape was obtained by super- imposing a short \"bump\" on a very long \"smooth\" front just before the crest was reached."
"The Bonneville Power Administration has been developing a system for producing substation design drawings by using automatic data processing methods. Although the system is not yet 100-percent operational on all phases of substation design, it is operational on 115-kV one-line diagrams, buslayouts for 500-kV breaker- and-a-half and ring-bus schemes, 115-kV customer's service stations, and some switchboard and relay panels. The basic programming structure has been established, and the system offers a practical and economical method of decreasing the man-hour requirements for substation design, where repetitive-type drawingsmust be produced for construction purposes. The project has been separated into six basic parts: 1) developing the basic logical structure, 2) reducing the graphical components to numerical data, 3) retrieving and assembling the necessary components for a specific drawing, 4) transforming the numerical data back into graphic form ( plotting), 5) generating a \"bill of material,\" 6) writing a \"material summary list.\" Ways of applying these parts to design drafting are discussed."
"A simple three-phase filter connection that can significantly reduce losses for high-power applications without automatic tuning is presented. It is shown that the fundamental-frequency power losses can, for some cases, be limited to those associated with the filter inductors and capacitors. Perfornance equations for the filter at the fundamental frequency and at resonance are derived, and an example is given."
"The parameters of polyphase transmission lines consisting of two or three equal parallel rectangular conductors are calculated for low and high frequencies. An analog RC network with about 3300 nodes has been built which allows the diffusion equation and Laplace's equation in an infinite plane to be solved, and which lends itself favorably to the method of virtual displacement, too. From measurements on this network, the coefficients of resistance and internal inductance per unit length are given for the even and odd modes of two-conductor transmission lines and for Clarke's *#x003B1;-ß-0 components of three-conductor transmission lines. The results can be used to calculate the influence of proximity effect on resistive and inductive losses in busbar systems and cables with rectangular conductors carrying arbitrary phase currents. Besides these results, methods are indicated to determine the capacitance per unit length, the electric and magnetic fields, and the magnetic forces between current-carrying conductors by means of the analog network. It is believed that the method for direct measurement of serial losses and the curves in Figs. 4-10 for the proximity effect of rectangular conductors are new."
"Experimental studies were conducted on lapped high-density polyethylene tape dielectric pressurized mainly with SF6 to clarify its performance under conditions of overvoltage in EHV systems."
"Three models of 275-kV pipe-type cables insulated with SF6 gas have been experimentally manufactured, and various tests on them were made by the author and his associates from 1965 to 1967. Some problems for the realization of such gas-insulated cables remain unsolved, and among these it may be fairly important to assess thermal characteristics of the cables when they are buried underground."
"This paper describes the forced cooling of a model of a pipe-type cable circuit, utilizing mechanical refrigeration to cool the pipe-filling oil. Measured oil film thermal resistances and oil chiller performance are reported. Two pipe-filling oils were tested, a high- viscosity oil normally used for pipe-type cable and an experimental low-viscosity polybutene. The test results are expected to have an important effect on the design of future field installations of forced- cooled pipe-type cable circuits."

"The paper suggests a reliability criterion for use in adaptive control of power systems. A generalized method of forecasting the reliability or security of an operating system on a short- term basis is given. Also given are specific probabilistic models for use in forecasting the sufficiency of spinning generation capacity."
"Installed generating reserve requirements may be determined from both single-area and two-area loss-of-load probability studies. An example system is used to introduce the results of a single-area study and to illustrate the interpretations. A general procedure for including load uncertainties is traced for the example, and the results are analyzed."
"A three-area loss-of-load probability theory is presented which forms the basis of a practical working computer program. The method applies specifically to electric power systems within which transmission limitations exist. Existing single-area techniques assume no transmission limitations. A method recognizing tie-line limitations between two areas was published in 1963 [1]."
"A step-by-step procedure for reliability evaluations of transmission systems is described. Simple algebraic results for prediction of frequency and duration of transmission contingencies are obtained with the use of renewal process theory."
"A number of methods of calculating reliability figures of merit for generating systems exist, but to date absolute comparisons of the accuracy of the various methods do not seem to have been made. Comparisons of some of these methods are made here, using a typical power system as a test system and results from a digital computer simulation as the basis for comparison. The paper also presents a modified calculation technique that is easy to apply and whose results closely approximate results obtained by system simulation."
"This paper describes methods for using power system readings to compute a real-time power flow solution of the transmission network. The use of redundant data is discussed and procedures are outlined to detect, identify, and correct for data errors. Several examples are presented and the numerical behavior of the methods is discussed."
"The North American Power Systems Interconnection Committee recommends that each control area set its frequency bias equal to the so-called area frequency response characteristic (AFRC). The authors question seriously the basis for this practice and prove by the methods of optimum control that better response and wider stability margins can be obtained by lower bias settings."
"This paper records the development of a state variable model of the megawatt-frequency control problem of multiarea electric energy systems. The model is in a mathematical form necessary for application of theorems of modem optimal control theory."
"The horizontal components of the electric and magnetic fields due to auroral atmospheric currents are calculated at the surface of the earth. For sinusoidal changes in the earth's magnetic field (Fourier frequency components of actual nonsinusoidal variations), a lower limit of the corresponding earth-surface potential is obtained by considering a line-type auroral current over a nonuniform stratified earth. An upper limit of the earth-surface potential is obtained by considering a current-sheet model of the auroral current, and the same model of the earth. A diagram is constructed that allows calculation of the earth-surface potential for given variations in the earth's magnetic field. Finally, the influence of the earth-surface potential on electric power systems is discussed."
"A short circuit from one pole to ground on a bipolar overhead dc line can produce an overvoltage factor as high as 2.2 per unit on the unfaulted pole, which may cause flashover of line insulation, thus converting a monopolar fault into a bipolar one. This is undesirable because a bipolar fault causes a greater disturbance to the power system than does a monopolar fault."
"Digital programs are used to investigate the overvoltages induced in one pole of a bipolar HVDC overhead line, and caused by a line-ground fault on the other dc pole. Various digital tests are carried out, bearing in mind in particular the nature of dc line termination at the converter stations, which may include filter circuits and a surge capacitor. It is shown that the terminal that looks inductive to a wavefront coming from the dc line is undesirable because it would cause high overvoltages at the terminal of the unfaulted pole. It is also shown that in order to reduce the risk of developing a double-pole outage from a single-pole fault, it is desirable to do away with the surge capacitor, if a suitable dc lightning arrester can be designed. Tests are presented in stages to isolate the effects of fault resistance, grid control, and line resistance. Results also indicate the restraints to be put upon the dv/dt line fault detection in order to avoid operation of this protection in the unfaulted pole."
"This paper concerns the insulation of reactors and resistors in the harmonic filter circuits on the dc side of an HVDC converter station. The cost of these reactors and resistors is greatly dependent on their insulation levels, and could be a substantial part of the total filter costs if their insulation levels are comparable to the insulation level of the dc busbars."
"An availability and a reliability prediction has been made for a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) terminal containing silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs). This prediction was made using published failure rates for the electronic equipment. Published failure rates and outage duration times were used for such ac equipment as power transformers and power circuit breakers. Actual field failure rate data were used for the SCRs. Estimates were used for the time that it would take to replace electronic equipment in order to get back into service."
"A power synchro system is studied using modem analytical, computational, and experimental methods to extend previous studies. Previous work is reviewed, and equations are derived describing the system for dynamic and steady-state performance. The dynamic equations are linearized by the Taylor series expansion to obtain describing equations which permit the study of dynamic performance by the well-developed techniques of linear system analysis. Methods are described for the study of the system by frequency response and state variable techniques."
"An actual synchro system is examined with particular attention to dynamic behavior. Using frequency response and eigenvalue analysis, dynamic behavior is examined over a wide speed range. Experimental results obtained by frequency response measurements on the actual system are presented. Predicted values are correlated with experimental results and conclusions drawn regarding system performance, in particular concerning stability. Some steady-state results are also included to show the effectiveness of the model in predicting performance."
"The single-sided stator and the double-sided stator configurations of the infinitely long linear induction motor are analyzed from electromagnetic field theory, and the traction force and the normal force equations are derived using the Maxwell magnetic stress tensor. The force normal to the air-gap plane, which has not been quantitatively evaluated or understood before, is found to be highly repulsive for slips greater than St = 1/Rm (Rm magnetic Reynolds number). The engineering use of this large repulsive force to provide frictionless contact-free means for levitation, suspension, and mechanical stabilization of high-speed transport at speeds of 300 mi/h is considered. A physical explanation is given for the existence of the normal force components. The equivalent circuit is derived for the linear induction motor so that the forces and the design parameters obtained from field theory can be understood in terms of traditional induction motor theory. The performance characteristics are investigated, and it is found that the two key design parameters are 1) the magnetic Reynolds number Rm and 2) the air-gap-wavelength ratio ßg. The single-sided stator configuration is considered for levitation, and the criterion for a self-levitating vehicle is given. In the double-sided stator configuration, the net normal force is a restoring force which is considered for keeping the vehicle aligned on track against lateral perturbations. In this case, the equivalent electromagnetic spring constant Ck and the natural frequency of oscillation fm are derived and their performance characteristics investigated."
"Constant starting torque of a wound rotor motor can be achieved by inserting a fixed external element consisting of resistances and reactances combination in the rotor circuit instead of using a saturable reactor or other feedback devices. This approach provides the desired starting characteristic at a low cost of starting equipment. The generalized equations for deternining the values of external parameters for a desired starting torque are based upon a graphical approach."

"An analysis is developed for the starting performance of single-phase induction motors having asymmetrical windings not in quadrature. Based on Morrill's double-revolving field concept, the analysis leads to an equivalent circuit which accounts satisfactorily for all the space harmonics including those arising from irregular winding distribution. All the parameters for the equivalent circuit can be calculated from the design details."
"A mathematical relation between the least force and the shading ring resistance and the ratio of the shaded to the total area is developed. For every value of this ratio, there exists an optimum value of the shading ring resistance which would give maximum least force. In the case of an E magnet, although the middle limb does not have a shading ring, the magnet taken as a whole tends to increase the least force. A general theory of the double shading ring is suggested, and it is shown that the double shading ring develops up to 15 percent more least force for higher ratios of the shaded area to the total area. The theories are confirmed by measurements."

"The joint burial of primary power and telephone distribution cables with no deliberate separation is known as random separation. After extensive tests, the Joint Edison Electric Institute- Bell System Subcommittee to Study Buried Distribution Systems recommended random separation between telephone cables and certain types of primary power cables having bare neutrals in direct contact with the earth and protected by devices capable of clearing faults within prescribed time-current limitations. There has been favorable experience with over 18 million trench feet of random construction serving more than 200 000 dwelling units. The National Electrical Safety Code and state regulations have been revised to permit random separation."
"The mechanical reliability of a porcelain insulator is dependent upon its ability to resist both initiation and propagation of cracks. Laboratory tests have shown that such resistance is dependent on the nature of flaws present and the magnitude and duration of load. These tests included time-load studies, crack extension testing, and a study of ultimate strength versus flaws. With a better understanding of the fracture phenomena disclosed in the tests incorporated in this paper, it may be possible to design improved insulators."
"An investigation of the effects of system and transformer parameters on phase-phase switching surges on transformer-terminated 500-kV lines was conducted on a transient network analyzer. The results of this study are presented, including surge magnitudes, waveshapes, and the line-neutral polarity components comprising the phase-phase surges. Typical surge distribution curves are also discussed."
"The effects of system parameters and transformer sizes on phase-phase switching surges on 500-kV autotransformer- transmission line combinations when switched through the auto- transformer were investigated on a transient network analyzer. The results of the study are presented, including surge magnitude, waveshapes, and the line-neutral polarity components comprising the phase-phase surges. Phase-phase switching-surge frequency of occurrence data are illustrated."
"Considering only the fundamental frequency components of currents and voltages, an idealized synchronous machine under any unbalanced load conditions can be represented in phase coordinates, by the sum of a constant impedance matrix and an impedance matrix whose elements are functions of current phase angles. A general method of solving for the unknown current phase angles and hence the total impedance matrix is given when the external impedances are known. The results are shown to be consistent with 1) two-reaction theory for the case of balanced steady- state loads, and 2) symmetrical-component theory using sequence- impedance representation under the assumption of zero resistances in all circuits. Numerical comparison shows that although the current magnitudes can be calculated by the approximate sequence- impedance representation quite accurately, current phase angles could differ, in certain cases, up to about 10°."
"A single-unit reluctance converter is discussed. The rotor used is of a double-permeance type, and a method of optimizing its shape for any frequency ratio is attempted. In tune with the present trend, single-winding arrangements are proposed for the stator. Further extension for simultaneous double-frequency conversion makes it all the more versatile. Apart from theory and design, experimental investigations on five laboratory-size machines establish the soundness of the schemes."
"As the largest producer of diesel-electric locomotives in the world, Electro-Motive Division of General Motors Corporation has played a major role in the development of the dc traction motor. An integral part of this development has been the improvement of methods needed to evaluate the performance of proposed traction motor designs. This paper introduces an experimental method, now under development, that enables one to determine the current waveform in an armature coil as it is being commutated. The usefulness of this facility is twofold. First of all, an investigator can use this method as a tool to enable him to understand better the phenomenon of commutation, which has long been a perplexing problem for those working in the area of applied machines. Second, an engineer can use the infornation obtained by this method as an indication of the effects of a given design change on commutation."
"Most commercial HVDC plants now operating are equipped with the same type of control system, the so-called individual phase control system. This system is simple and the operating experience is excellent. However, the requirements for future installations will sometimes be difficult to fulfill with the existing control system. This may be the case when the HVDC transmission is connected to a very weak ac network or to a generator station with large variations in frequency."
"The current control system of an HVDC converter has rather complicated dynamic properties, and it is not possible to determine these by simple manual calculations. Instead, frequency analysis in an HVDC simulator has been the available method for stabilization of the system."
"This paper traces developments in high-voltage mercury arc valves for HVDC power transmission in relation to problems conceming \"consequent\" failure. Investigations are reported on the physical conditions in valves during and after high forward current pulses. An account is given of some of the main development work aimed at producing valves with greatly reduced consequent failure probability."
"This paper outlines some of the physical phenomena that occur during overcurrent surges in mercury-arc converters, and discusses the relevance of these phenomena to the \"consequential arc-back\" performance of practical valves. Some experimental work on small-scale models reported has led to a better understanding of the effects of anode geometry on one form of consequential arc-back. Full-scale tests on valves incorporating a modified-anode geometry have confirmed the small-scale findings."
"The results of experimental studies on the contamination flashover strength of different shapes of transmission line insulators are presented. Insulators with mechanical strengths from 15 000 to 90 000 pounds and with disk diameters from 10 to 152/4 inches were used on these tests. New types of fog insulators with high creepage distance showed better performance than the others. Tests on long insulator strings also have been conducted for standard-type disk insulators. Nonlinearity of insulation strength with insulator length was indicated at voltage levels of 350 kV and above, i.e., 600-kV phase-to-phase voltage. These tests employed the steam- fog method used at General Electric's Project UHV since May 1968."
"The test results reported in [1] for which Cab-O-Sil®was used as a slurry binder are compared with tests made using a slurry having a binder of kaolin and bentonite. Also investigated were the effect of nonuniformity of the contaminating coating and the strength of horizontal versus vertical contaminated insulator strings."
"As an effective measure to prevent pollution flashover troubles in substations, fixed-type hot-line insulator washing has been widely used. The fundamental study on electrical performances of polluted insulators under washing and the performance of a fixed- type washing system are described. It also discusses the necessity of insulation coordination for pollution."
"An evaluation is made of the performance of a three- ended dc transmission line superimposed on an ac network. Tests were conducted both with two rectifiers and one inverter and with one rectifier and two inverter terminals. Performance of these circuit configurations was evaluated under various steady-state and transient conditions."
"Part I of the paper gives the results of flashover tests carried out on rod-plane and rod-rod gaps of both polarities, with applied dc valtace up to 1600 kV."
"This paper applies Kalman's procedure for the construction of Lur'e-type Lyapunov functions to a single-machine system with and without a velocity governor. The procedure uses the theorem of Popov on the absolute stability of nonlinear systems. The Lyapunov function so derived is used for estimating the region of asymptotic stability of the postfault system. The method is applicable to a single-machine system with any type of governor that admits of a representation by linear dynamics, the order being immaterial. Numerical examples are given."
"This paper outlines a method for computing a stability region for a multimachine power system. It is shown that the dynamic equations describing this system are of the type for which some rather elegant stability criteria are known, of which the Popov criterion is the most useful. It can be proved by means of a Lyapunov function which will, together with a method for computing the domain of attraction of an equilibrium point of a dynamic system, lead to a systematic procedure for obtaining an estimate of the region of stability for a multimachine power system. The procedure is very well suited for automatic computation and can take into consideration the effects of damping and of fast governors."
"The Markov process concept is used to derive expressions for an equivalent of two units in series and parallel considering two-state conditions of fluctuating normal and stormy weather. These expressions are then used to simplify a system by the series and parallel block reduction technique. It is observed that this technique alone is not sufficient for a system where a complex configuration is involved. For such cases, star-delta conversion in addition to the series and parallel equivalents is used. The results obtained by this technique are compared with those obtained by existing methods. Finally a computer algorithm for system reduction is described."
"An algorithm has been developed to form the bus admittance matrix Ybu,, by forming the network through a step-by- step addition of a line or a passive element to the system, taking into account the mutual coupling between the elements. Two sets of formulas have been derived for the addition of a tree branch and for the addition of a link. This method eliminates the formation of incidence matrices and does not require singular or nonsingular transformations. This algorithm is very convenient for calculation in digital computers."
"In some studies of HVDC system design, ac system impedance is represented by its inductance at power frequency. However, for several studies better simulation of the impedance- frequency characteristic (from power frequency to a few kilohertz) of the ac system is important. This paper presents a simple approach to calculating an approximate equivalent network consisting of parallel LCR branches and having an impedance-frequency characteristic similar to that given for the ac system. For given typical ac system impedance diagrams (usually obtained from ac system models and simulators), simulation of an ac system by corresponding equivalent networks during studies of certain HVDC problems would provide a more accurate means of designing HVDC systems."
"The Microwave Subcommittee of the Power System Communications Committee has studied the use of microwave radio to provide protective relaying channels and has compiled the results of a questionnaire sent to users. The report indicates the extent of present-day uses of microwave for protective relaying, trends in their uses, and whether or not relaying over microwave has proved successful."
"Based on the present state of the art a simplified picture depicting the characteristic of corona plumes and RI generation from EHV line conductors during fair weather is presented. An artificial source was developed to simulate some natural sources that were identified in the field insofar as plume and RI generation are concerned. By means of the artificial source, a prediction is made on the RI levels expected from UHV transmission lines. The prediction is based on laboratory test results from the artificial sources on conductors of different diameters but presumes the same number of sources per mile of UHV line as for EHV lines. Further investigations are required to verify this assumption."
"The calculating method of the radio noise (RI) level of an extra-high-voltage (EHV) line is proposed. The mean value and standard deviation of the RI level in fair weather and the average RI level of the wet conductor at a rate of rain can be easily predicted by the calculating equations. Moreover, when an EHV line is designed, the conductor of the suitable diameter can be chosen easily and precisely by the application of this calculating method, as no disturbance given to the radio receiver exists at the RI levels of its line."
"A new method of predetermining corona losses under rain is suggested. Instead of setting up empirical formulas based on experimenting according to customary proceedings, a quantitative analysis of the loss mechanism is discussed. In this way networks of losses which are valid for any kind of conductor or line are obtained, but in a slightly idealized form due to certain simplifying hypotheses. Further on application is made to show how the new calculation method was tested by way of a very careful experimentation; then it is explained how to pass from idealized networks to directly applicable loss networks. The limits and possibilities of the usage is also specified."
"The method of calculating corona losses, developed for unipolar operation mode, is used in the paper to study corona loss characteristics of several practical HVDC transmission lines. Detailed results on the influence of various line parameters upon corona loss characteristics of monopolar lines with single as well as bundle conductors, of homopolar lines, and of monopolar lines with overhead ground wires are given."
"This paper presents the results of a statistical analysis of conductor radio influence (RI) and corona-loss data taken over a one-year period on three 775-kV test lines at the Apple Grove 750-kV project, a joint extra-high- voltage ( EHV) field investigation sponsored by American Electric Power Service Corporation and Westing- house Electric Corporation with six other participating companies. Verification of the Apple Grove project special design features is discussed, and long-term averages of corona-loss and RI performance of conductor diameters of 1.382, 1.196, and 1.00 inches used in four-conductor bundles are presented along with their standard deviations. Very little correlation was found between fair weather RI and weather variables. Data are presented showing the effect of rain intensity on foul weather RI and corona loss."
"This paper presents the results of RI continuous recording carried out during almost two years on an operating 420-kV line in northern Italy. The effect of atmospheric conditions and operating voltage is shown, and important daily, seasonal, and annual variations of the radio interference are evidenced."
"An oscilloscope method for locating power line television interference is described. The method has several advantages over the use of meter readings, including that of discrimination between noise sources when several are present. Practical information is given regarding equipment requirements and use. Observed noise-pulse patterns are illustrated by photographs. TVI reduction by means of correction and prevention is discussed. TVI can result from corona-precipitation impingement on EHV lines and is an important consideration."
"After a brief review of the theory involved, results of some conductor radio noise research at Project UHV are presented. These tests are based on measurements of conductors in cages and on laboratory tests of short conductor sections. Radio noise in foul and fair weather is discussed, and the results are presented in terms of excitation function and surface gradient. The relation of the excitation function to the electric field near the conductor rather than the surface gradient alone is examined, and a simple theoretical approach is proposed. Some experimental data on audible noise are included, as are potential and gradient calculations for the environs of bundled conductors."
"This paper presents further studies of lightning outage rates on double-circuit transmission lines. Satisfactory agreement with field data has been demonstrated for calculations of total and double-circuit outage rates and for prediction of outage types on high-voltage lines. An analysis of the parameters influencing double- circuit outage rates has enabled proposal of several line designs that should achieve a low proportion of lightning faults involving both circuits. Two configurations are of particular interest-a double-horizontal arrangement with one circuit above the other, and a double-triangular arrangement utilizing a conventional lattice tower with three crossarms."
"A new numerical method is described for the solution of electric field problems where the field is not bounded in space, but extends infinitely far. This method belongs to the class of boundary-relaxation techniques in which an artificial finite boundary condition is initially introduced to allow solution and then iteratively removed as the solution proceeds. The method has been implemented in extensive computer programs, which produce equipotential plots of the electric field in the neighborhood of dielectric and conductive bodies possessing rotational symmetry. Application to the analysis of suspension insulators and related devices is described, and several field plots exhibited for standard insulator types. The method permits sufficiently short computation times to allow detailed investigation of the effects of insulator contamination by conductive substances, variation of dielectric constant, or other factors."
"One of the main problems in EHV and UHV systems is the control of transient overvoltages of internal origin. The first part of this paper investigates different approaches to limit over- voltages due to line energization and reenergization; the second part deals with fault and fault-clearing overvoltages. Finally, the relative severity of the former type of overvoltage versus the latter in EHV and UHV systems is compared."
"The effectiveness of series capacitors used with long distance transmission lines in improving system stability is analyzed. Compensation efficiency is defined as the effectiveness of series capacitors. The influence of various factors on compensation efficiency such as capacitor location, line length, and degree of series compensation is investigated. Proper use of shunt reactors with series capacitors, in addition to limiting power frequency over- voltages, increases the maximum power transfer. Analytical expressions are included to aid in the calculation of compensation efficiency for a few typical cases. Curves are also presented indicating the critical value of shunt Mvar required for various degrees of series compensation and line lengths."
"Of the several methods for annual (or seasonal) peak- demand forecasting being used, or under development, by electric utility companies, some are more suitable for probabilistic forecasts than others. This paper reviews six possible approaches to peak-demand forecasting but places greatest emphasis on probabilistic monthly or weekly peak demand forecasting and the derivation of annual peak forecasts from monthly or weekly forecasts. An introduction to the use of stochastic models for demand forecasting is also included."
"Results of a simulation study of five different load- shedding schedules using a comprehensive long-term dynamic simulator are presented. Insight is provided into the effectiveness of underfrequency load shedding, and the important factors to consider in establishing a load-shedding schedule are discussed."
"In this paper, making use of the well-established linearized equations of the synchronous machine and its control equipment, the characteristic equation of the system is developed. Using this characteristic equation, relative dynamic stability regions are mapped in the regulator parameter plane. The mapping gives a qualitative idea of the transient response of the system for small disturbances. The use of the Chebyshev functions greatly facilitates the procedure, especially when a digital computer is used."
"The problem of restoring a power system to its initial steady state in minimum time after a transient disturbance is identified as a minimum time problem in optimal control theory. The optimal control obtained to achieve this objective, by use of Pontryagin's maximum principle, is bang-bang control of line reactance. The implementation of this scheme on a simple power system model is shown, along with numerical results."
"New integration algorithms suitable for power system transient stability studies are developed and applied to a simple power system example. Both theoretical and preliminary experimental investigations indicate that the new algorithms operate satisfactorily at step sizes five or even te l times those necessary to assure numerical stability when using conventional one-step and multistep methocls. Since the computation time per integration time step of the new methods is similar to that of the conventional methods, the new methods offer significant saving in overall computing effort."

"The paper analyzes the minimum excitation limits being fed from the stator terminals of a synchronous generator. Mathematical methods are developed for evaluating the effectiveness of a new limit in its different settings and for comparing its characteristics with the \"basic limit,\" which has some of the features of the limits often applied. The effectiveness and characteristics of the new limit can be changed over a wide range in order to match them to special demands. Depending on its setting, the new limit either prevents or permits the generator to work beyond its steady-state stability curve in the steady state."
"It is generally accepted that a high-performance excitation system may reduce the effective internal damping of a synchronous machine. Alternately, studies and field tests indicate that a fast-acting excitation system offers the best opportunity for increased damping through the use of an auxiliary signal into the voltage regulator. The application of static exciters to water-wheel generators requires an awareness of these possible changes in machine damping. The use of an auxiliary damping signal into the voltage regulator may become especially important for machines that are inherently lightly damped."
"Service data on girth cracks in asphalt-mica stator winding insulation have been studied statistically. Probabilistic application of the results can lead to better plans for maintaining high reliability and availability in large generators with this type of insulation."
"The problem of solving the general three-phase induction motor performance equations is discussed and methods of digital solution for both the three-phase motor and the two-axis model are described."
"Simulations of induction machines under dynamic conditions have heretofore been based on two-phase models using constant circuit parameters. Most induction motors in the integral horsepower sizes have rotor bars of sufficient depth that they cannot be accurately represented by a constant rotor resistance under all operating conditions A method for incorporating the rotor deep-bar effect in a dynamic simulation is presented."
"An analysis is presented of the high-frequency losses occurring on no-load in cage induction motors having open stator slots. The theory covers both the important rotor constructions in which the rotor slots are either skewed or unskewed. The component losses calculated are surface and tooth-pulsation iron losses in both rotor and stator, and rotor I2R losses including those due to circumferential conduction between the bars and the coreplates of skewed machines. Computed losses are compared with tests on 35 large motors and, in the cases with skewed rotors, the correlation is used to find an effective mean value of bar-to-bar resistance. Examples are included in which the losses were predicted with satisfactory accuracy, without prior knowledge of test figures. The analysis and the computer program are useful in assessing designs and in comparing alternative constructions such as skewed or unskewed rotors and open or semiclosed stator slots."
"Special instrumentation was developed for monitoring the magnitude and frequency of occurrence of surge voltages in residential and industrial circuits. Over a period of 2 years, more than 400 locations in 20 cities were surveyed. Monitoring was accomplished by automatic recording cathode-ray oscilloscopes and simple surge counters. In residential circuits, two significant sources of surge voltages were identified: load switching within the house, and external surges, most likely associated with lightning, coming through the service drop. In industrial circuits, the levels of surges are lower than in residential circuits. However, switching surges on the load side of the switch can be severe. Internally generated surges as high as 2500 volts were recorded during this test program, and surges due to lightning reaching 5600 volts have been recorded on a 120-volt overhead distribution line."
"Damage by transient overvoltages of equipment operating on low-voltage ac power circuits has received increasing attention. Before effective protection can be devised, it is necessary to understand the nature of the phenomenon. Relatively little information has been published. The Working Group on Surge Voltages in AC Power Circuits Rated 600 Volts and Less has compiled a bibliography on the subject. References are grouped in broad categories, and a short paragraph describing each paper follows the reference."
"Results of a survey and symposium on local backup relaying protection is presented. The survey covers the responses of 121 relay engineers to questions pertaining to their present-day preferences on duplicate relays, dc and ac sources, control power, and breaker failure protection. The symposium offered the opportunity to present detailed philosophy, circuit configuration, and explanations to supplement the statistics compiled in the survey."
"This paper was prepared from data collected in tests made to evaluate the effectiveness of shielding control cables that are laid in concrete trenches located in an EHV environment. Particular attention is given to the effectiveness of shielding against high frequency transients generated by the opening and closing of 500 kV disconnect switches. Transients or spurious signals caused by induction from 60 Hz fault currents, or by the energization or deenergization of DC contactor coils, or relay coils has fairly well been documented. Because of this, the main attention of this paper will be given to the subject of high frequency transients generated by multiple restrikes in an arc or in corona. This paper will discuss the variour tests made, and the results of the tests are tabulated."
"A new breakdown mechanism of oil-filled cable joints, based upon some basic experiments which were carried out by the authors, is suggested, and the reliability of smaller joints for single-conductor 77-kV cables is also described."
"Five formulas proposed at various times by King, Lyons, Schelkunoff, and Terman to calculate the magnetic field shielding efficiency of nonmagnetic shields have been compared. Data from two metal sheaths, one welded corrugated tube, three tape shields, and one braided shield show that King's low-frequency formula is the only one applicable at frequencies such that skin depth is greater than or equal to shield thickness. When skin depth is less than shield thickness, the mathematically equivalent full- frequency formulas of Lyons and Schelkunoff are suitable; they are inapplicable at lower frequencies. When skin depth is less than or equal to 0.5-inch shield thickness, the mathematically equivalent Terman's radio frequency or King's asymptotic formulas are suitable."
"The tests made by the Aluminum Company of Canada Ltd. to determine the optimum automatic fire-detection system for the open ventilation-type generators at its Chute-à-Caron plant are described. Several detection systems were studied, resulting in smoke detection and fixed-temperature detection systems being tested. The test results indicated that a fixed-temperature detection system was most suitable for this application and probably for most other types of vertically mounted air-cooled generators."
"The changeover of a reversible pump-generating unit from full-load pumping to full-load generating has been accomplished in the unusually short time of 27 seconds. Comparison of this mode of operation, called rapid reversal, to more usual operations is made and control details are outlined. Application of this mode of operation can improve the contribution of a pumping-generating plant during power system emergencies."
"A stability study of a dc power system is performed by applying Nyquist stability criterion to a mathematical model that describes the behavior of the system during small disturbances about a steady-state operating point. The operating-point stability, as predicted by this linearized model, is compared with the response of the hybrid computer simulation of the actual system. Regions of instability for various system parameters, including the impedance of the ac system and the transmission line length, are established by a digital computer study. The delay and attenuation of the transmission line as well as the action of the converters with typical controllers are accurately taken into account. The linearized model presented should be helpful in the design and development of converter control systems for two-terminal dc power systems. Moreover, this method of analysis may be readily extended to include multiterminal dc power systems."
"Alternative control philosophies suggested for short- distance HVDC links promise improved performance of the inverter as compared to usual constant direct voltage control. Reactive power characteristics are discussed for both inverter and rectifier. The requirements for compensating equipment and the consequences with respect to transmission losses are outlined."
"Techniques are developed for the hybrid computer simulation of multiterminal dc power transmission systems with two- or three-conductor transmission lines. The switching of the static converters as well as the attenuation and transport delay of a distortionless transmission line are represented in detail. An example study is performed using a hybrid simulation of a singlepole three-terminal system, wherein the converter terminals are represented on the analog portion and the transmission line is represented on the digital portion of the hybrid computer. Results include waveforms for the transient behavior of the system during line faults on each of the three transmission branches."
"In case of the determination of insulation level of h.v.d.c. converter installation, surge transfer has to be taken into consideration."
"Data automatically recorded for 6 months were used to evaluate the radio noise performance of a short test section and an operating transmission line of the same construction. The distribution of noise levels was compared to determine the extent to which test line data would represent long line performance."
"This is the first report to the industry on television interference (TVI) resulting from precipitation on 500 kV transmission lines. The report describes television interference as it relates to corona activity as well as type and intensity of precipitation. Interference evaluation techniques were developed and measurements made on single 2.5\" OD, two 1.6\" OD and four 0.93\" OD conductors."
"Radio noise, audible noise, and corona loss quantities dependent only on the corona phenomena at the conductor surface were determined by means of tests on conductors in cages. These quantities were then utilized to predetermine radio noise, audible noise, and corona loss for typical lines under rain. The dependence on diameter and number of subconductors was investigated. Using these data, the noise and loss characteristics of representative UHV transmission lines were plotted."
"This paper deals with the corona losses of EHV lines in wet conditions. Using a calculation method presented in [1] and [2] and numerous measurements made in a test station, it is shown that surface state coefficients can be defined versus the aging of conductors and the intensity of rainfalls. Knowledge of the surface state coefficients allows the calculation of corona losses in rain of any EHV line."
"Methods for minimizing the error in an estimate of the voltage at a given probability of flashover (e. g., 3 sigma withstand) are presented. The variance in the estimate of a voltage is minimized with respect to the applied voltage and the number of applications of that voltage. It is shown that testing at approximately 5-percent and 95-percent probability of flashover yields maximum information about such quantities as 2 sigma and 3 sigma withstand voltages, and standard deviation."
"Flashover tests were conducted with the cooperation of the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, Inc., and the Chubu Electric Power Company, Inc., at the top of Mount Nyũ gasa, 1850 meters above sea level and the Takeyama Laboratory, nearly at sea level, to obtain comparative data to evaluate the influence of air density on the flashover voltages of air gaps and insulators."
"This report was prepared as an activity of the IEEE Working Group* on Capacitance Current Switching of the Power Circuit Breaker Subcommittee of the IEEE Switchgear Committee. It includes references to the switching of transmission lines, cables, and shunt capacitors, but excludes series capacitors. The references are arranged by years."
"A general mathematical model of an n-conductor transmission line is given. With a fault on the transmission line, simulated by an application of a cancellation source, the superposition principle is applied to obtain the transient solution of the system with nonzero initial conditions. The worst case of fault surges, a single line-to-ground fault at the midpoint of the line, is investigated. The maximum overvoltage occurs at the midpoint and is found to be increased with the line length."
"An algorithm for constructing the admittance matrix of a power system is given which is based upon the concept of an indefinite admittance matrix. The application of this algorithm to a power system with mutually coupled elements is discussed. The simplicity of the method is illustrated by means of an example."
"One prime objective in developing a computer program is to minimize the running time requirements. For short-circuit programs, one major obstacle is the time absorbed in processing mutually coupled elements for line-out and open-end conditions."
"In the short-circuit study of a network with mutually coupled lines, complications in calculation are introduced by the consideration of line removals, additions, impedance changes, and end faults. The modification of Z-bus terms to include these network changes is facilitated by the new algorithms presented in this paper. These new algorithms conform to a unified formulation for all the types of network changes mentioned, a feature that simplifies programming and reduces computer storage and processing time. In contrast with previously known algorithms, the new algorithms are simpler and are one-step procedures, i. e., the desired Z-bus modifications are obtained directly from original Z-bus and branch admittance data in one operation."
"An MHD generator having a uniform rectangular duct is analyzed for a three-dimensional flow. Expressions in closed form are obtained for the fluid velocity, induced electromagnetic fields, open-circuit voltage, power output, power input, efficiency, etc. These quantities are computed for typical values of dimensions, temperature, and velocity at the center of the generator."
"This paper illustrates a number of mathematical procedures associated with the implementation of a method for analysis of linear systems subject to pseudorandom input disturbances. The basic method associated with the two-level quantization of a given random input is discussed in detail in [1]. The generalized mean square error proposed by Spooner and Rideout [2] is employed as the performance index."
"Transient stability problems become much more severe where the system design criteria is based on \"stuck-breaker\" fault clearing times, particularly where three-phase faults are used. Such a criterion is difficult and frequently impossible to meet with normal system design. Results of studies exploring the relative effect on transient stability limits of several options available to the system planner, including transmission strength, excitation system response, and early valving, are presented. Early valving appears to offer attractive stability improvement in those cases where such improvement is needed."
"This paper gives information of a general, historical and technical nature regarding power supply in South Africa. It records current practice in connection with power stations, transmission lines and substations and gives details of the national grid now under construction and the probable future expansion of the network to form an electrically interconnected international system in Southern Africa."
"Since the design practices described in this paper are numerous, wide in scope, and briefly dealt with, the material can be abstracted only by enumerating the subjects treated. Included under \"POWERHOUSE\" are: turbine-generators, generator bus, control and instrumentation, protective relaying, data logging, annunciation, communications, station service power, vital a-c power, motors, batteries, cable, cable trays, and conduit. \"SWITCHYARD\" includes main power transformers, general arrangement, insulation levels, and grounding. \"COAL HANDLING\" covers power supply, control, and instrumentation.

"The installation of a dual-energy plant to provide exhaust heat to a chemical plant and electricity for the plant and other area loads in a severe high-temperature, dust-laden environment is described in this paper. Of interest are the electrical and mechanical features and operating experience to date for the 15-megawatt nominal-rated gas turbine generator set which was derated due to high ambient desert temperature conditions. Increased insulation levels were specified for all outdoor electrical equipment."
"Current test procedures unduly overstress the midpoint of delta transformer windings during low- frequency dielectric testing. A revision to the USAS Transformer Standards (1) has been proposed to allow alternate test procedures to correct this problem and to allow possible economies in the design and testing of such delta winding transformers. This paper has been requested by the IEEE Working Group to explain the proposed revisions."
"A method of determining distribution transformer losses of the electric system at time of system peak is described. A computer solution based on transformer loading information available from the Transformer Load Monitoring program is developed. Equations for economic evaluation of distribution transformer losses are derived and a numerical example is included."
"The paper introduces the need for a systematic problem-solving aid in turbogenerator design and development. Finite difference simulation is taken as the basic concept behind a special computer language to aid the problem-solving function. This language (SIMSYS) is described, together with some examples of its use in new turbogenerator development, and conclusions are drawn about the utility of such a system."
"This bibliography covering the years 1966 through 1968 has been prepared for presentation as a transactions paper by the Bibliography and Publicity Subcommittee of the Rotating Machinery Committee. This report along with AIEE Publication S-32 \"Bibliography of Rotating Electric Machinery, 1886-1947\" and IEEE Transactions Paper No. 64-1 \"Bibliography of Rotating Electric Machinery for 1948-1961\" and IEEE Transactions Paper No. 31 TP 67-477 \"Bibliography of Rotating Electric Machinery for 1962-1965\" will give the industry reference to most of the readily available English language literature on the subject of rotating machinery."
"A two-speed single-winding single-phase induction motor based on the shaded-pole concept is developed, using pole- amplitude modulation logic, with only four terminals taken out from the winding. A tremendous improvement in the performance of the machine is shown to be possible when the shading winding is short circuited through a phase-shifting device. An economical value for the ratio of the shading to main winding turns, which has been known to be theoretically possible, is experimentally verified."
"The pole amplitude modulation method of obtaining economic and efficient two-speed operation from a normal single winding has been extended to two-phase motors. Extensive theoretical analysis supported by exhaustive experimental results covering numerous pole ratios forms a useful addition to the existing literature on armature windings."
"The phase modulation method of induction motor speed changing with single-winding machines has been extended to two-phase machines. The paper presents theory and design methods and shows for the first time that phase modulated motors can be wound with standard coils of equal turns and pitch. The study also brings out a useful comparison of amplitude and phase modulation techniques. The work is supported by extensive experimental investigations covering numerous pole ratios."
"Contains an entry for each author and coauthor included in this issue of the publication."
"This is the first revision of this publication, which formalizes the work of the System Controls Subcommittee of the Power System Engineering Committee on the terminology for automatic generation control on electric power systems. The need for standard terminology in this field became apparent after a study of technical papers indicated that many authors were using different definitions for their terms. Requests for the standardization of terms were also received from the operating groups of the large interconnected power systems in this country and Canada. This is the first publication in English devoted specifically to the terminology used in automatic generation control. The definitions in this publication were prepared for use primarily in the field of automatic generation control on electric power systems. Therefore, it is recognized that many of the terms are defined in too limited a manner for use in other fields. In the preparation"
"This Standard (IEEE Std. 308) presents criteria and requirements for the electric systems of nuclear generating stations specifically related to providing protection to the health and safety of the public. These are based on the following. (a) Redundant systems that require electric power are provided to cope with design basis events. (b) The conditions and the availability of the various portions of the systems following a design basis event cannot be predicted exactly. (c) The access to certain equipment following a design basis event may be limited for several months. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers has developed these criteria to provide guidance in the determination of the design features, minimum conditions of operation, and the surveillance requirements related to the electric power systems of the nuclear facility. Each applicant for a construction permit or an operating license for a nuclear facility in the USA is required to develop these items to comply with the Atomic Energy Commission's Code of Federal Regulations, Part 50."

"Limitations on both high-speed core available and computer running time required for solving large-scale power system problems are very serious restrictions that continually confront the power system analyst. Piecewise methods, or methods of tearing as they are also called, hold much promise for the solution of such large scale problems. In this paper, new piecewise methods and algorithms are derived. Variations of these algorithms for practical applications are developed. Both boundary iteration as well as diakoptic methods are described. The major emphasis of this paper is placed on the latter method. The use of elimination and triangular factorization techniques within the piecewise methods is also indicated."
"The interaction of the measuring system with an impulse -generating system is analyzed. The analysis shows that impulses of simple form cannot be obtained because of the generator impedance. The distortion of the impulse has significant effects on the measurement."
"The interaction between an impulse generating system and an impulse measuring system is dependent on the reflections that occur at the generator and divider ends of the measuring system lead. In this paper the impedances that cause these reflections are studied and discussed. The effects of the interactions are illustrated with sample oscillograms."
"Errors in high-voltage impulse measurements are classified as scale factor errors and errors due to limitations in response characteristics. Running work within the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) gives tentative requirements intended to keep the mentioned errors within reasonable limits. The theoretical basis of these requirements is presented and checked against some practical cases."
"A design for a UHV capacitive voltage divider for outdoor use, suitable for full-wave and switching-surge impulse voltage measurements, is described. Model studies, mechanical features and design of the low-voltage arm of the divider are examined. A calibration procedure is outlined, and the results of this are given. Results of tests under working conditions show that a satisfactory design has been achieved, giving a very short rise time and a high, voltage ratioaccuracy."
"Spectroscopic techniques, in synchronization with a high-speed rotating mirror arrangement, have been employed to determine the dynamic response characteristics of a well-stabilized coaxial arc plasma subjected to a step pulse in voltage; data acquisition time is about 5 μs. Experiments were conducted in argon at 1.1 atmospheres pressure with mass flows of 0.107, 0.157, and 0.206 grams per second. Radial distributions of temperature were obtained at various times during the transient. The timewise variation of arc radius was also determined."
"A description of aging stability for self-contained oil- filled cable dielectrics is given. The power factor of oil-filled cable dielectrics over an extended period and the dielectric properties of low-pressure self-contained oil-filled cable withdrawn from service were studied in the laboratory. From the test results, the authors suggest that the increase in the power factor of oil-filled cable after long use is mostly attributable to the deterioration of the mineral insulating oil. This conclusion clearly differs from the results reported in [1] and [6]."
"A novel device capable of monitoring the sheath temperature of underground power cables and indicating isolated hot spots is described. The novelty is in the hot-spot detecting principle, which is based on the use of a thin liquid-filled coaxial sensing cable attached to the power cable. A hot spot causes the liquid within the sensing cable to boil, forming a vapour bubble, the latter being detected by means of a pulse-echo radar method. Design features of the device and a trial installation are described, indicating the maximum operating range to be 1400 feet and the nominal response temperature 75°C."
"The development and use of a hydraulic method for locating oil leaks in underground cables is described. The method is applicable at cable terminals, and its overall accuracy in determining the distance to the leak is estimated to be within ±2 percent of the cable length between reservoirs or between a reservior and the nearest stop joint."
"A new halogen detector having excellent sensitivity and selectivity has been developed for the purpose of locating leaks in gas-filled underground cables. This detector has been in field use for about four years and a number of gas leaks have been located without difficulties."
"Lightning arresters have historically been restricted in usage to operating voltages which are equal to or less than the arrester rated voltage as determined by the standard duty cycle test. This results in application limits which are unnecessarily conservative when considering the modern current-limiting gap station arrester.1 The current-limiting gap arrester has inherent overvoltage capability, and, through specific tests, it is possible to evolve application rules which allow use of these specific arresters on transient power frequency voltages above the standard arrester voltage rating."
"From the results of an ANACOM study to investigate the frequency function of the occurrence of a switching surge, a simplified method to estimate the switching-surge flashover probability of a transmission line is developed and presented in a series of curves."
"Two different designs of bare single-layer steel- reinforced aluminum conductor are examined both by theoretical techniques and by experimental methods. An approximate model is developed which uses a new approach for solution for impedances of such conductors. A comparison between two different commercial designs is effected with the aid of the model, and the results are evaluated in the light of experimental evidence. Suggestions are made for comparing conductor designs and also for the improvement of designs."
"Certain problems exist concerning spacers in bundle transmission lines. The issues involve forces caused by fault current, hybrid fluttering (galloping) of the bundle, vibration, etc.; other problems such as the wear, fatigue, and relaxation of the materials used over a period also arise due to these forces. Because the existing literature on forces exerted during a fault event are concerned only with specific conditions, it is difficult to predict the force applied for an entirely different condition. The summarized analysis described here has been developed to predict forces exerted against spacers caused by fault conditions by using common basic calculations; experimental data, including those of the author, are provided for comparison to support the estimates made."
"The determination of transmission line ampacities using a statistical approach has been studied at the University of Saskatchewan [6]. This paper describes a method of statistically representing the weather elements by the method of moments and the Pearson family of curves. A digital method of determining the permanent loss of tensile strength due to annealing is also described. These two methods are combined and used to determine the conductor ampacity for selected assumed load patterns."
"In transmission systems in which a large inducing current flows into the overhead ground wires during short-circuit faults, it is essential that these wires have high conductivity. Aluminum alloy conductors, steel reinforced, have been used in the past. However, it has been shown in comparative tests that thick aluminum-clad AS strands have less deterioration of their properties due to short-circuit faults and are much better suited for use as over- head ground wires. Finally, the transient current capacities are given for various types of widely used AS ground wires."
"Shunt static capacitor banks are frequently an economical means of maintaining voltage levels under conditions of heavy load or transformer, line, and generation outages. This paper treats the allocation of capacitor banks as a discrete programming problem in which the objective is to minimize capital outlay for the banks required to control voltages under all anticipated contingencies."
"Self-excitation can result from using series capacitors in EHV transmission circuits if the series compensation is large and the circuit resistance small. Such a condition can be realized in a highly compensated transmission line using bundle conductors. An analytical approach to solve for the borderline conditions between stability and instability is presented. The analysis presented is suitable for the simultaneous consideration of both electromechanical (hunting) and primarily electrical (self-excitation) oscillations using lumped circuit constants, or for cases of distributed circuit parameters (long lines and/or solid-rotor generators). Numerical examples are included."
"A new, SF6 insulated 1500/✓3-kV, precision capacitor for outdoor operation is described. The capacitance of the unit is 5OpF, the dissipation factor is less than 0.001%, and BIL is 2550-kV. This design could be applicable to other high-voltage apparatus, such as instrument transformers or bushings."
"In order to determine major trends in substation design practices above 700 kV, a survey was made of three major electric utility systems in the United States and Canada. These findings are presented in tabular form for easy comparison of design features and are basically the criteria in use as of June 1, 1969. Some significant variationg in data are explained in the accompanying notes. This informnation should be valuable to companies planning systems in this voltage range and will also serve to be a permanent record of the state of the art at this point in time."
"The calculation of eddy-current losses in aluminum sheets of definite and infinite thickness in the presence of bus bars carrying heavy currents is presented. The expression for losses has been developed; a digital computer has been used to calculate the losses for several particular cases. Various curves are plotted to make the results readily available for practical use. The investigation indicates a thickness of conductor sheet in proximity to a bus bar which causes minimum loss due to eddy currents induced in it."
"This paper suggests a new equivalent circuit for double- cage induction motors. The circuit parameters were calculated using well-established procedures, and the predicted results were verified from the test results available for commercial machines of various sizes and outputs. A modified approach has also been suggested to represent iron losses."
"Improvements in the method of determining the magnetic fields of nonlinear dc machines are introduced in part I of the paper. A modified, successive line overrelaxation technique to satisfy boundary conditions is developed. A novel block relaxation technique, the additive acceleration of convergence, is explained. The improved method also takes care of relative position changes between field and armature. In part II [8] the improved method is applied to a large dc machine. A new computer flux plotting procedure is developed in part III [9]."
"Based on methods described in Part I1 of the paper, the airgap radial inductions are calculated for four different rotor positions at full load and at one rotor position at twice full load. Line over-relaxation and additive acceleration of convergence techniques are used. Convergence criteria are described. Results of experiments to find suitable over-relaxation factors and expedient line integral paths for convergence accelerations are given. A computer program is detailed and applied to a 500 hp, 750 V, 4-pole, 300/900 r/min, dc motor."
"A computer program for establishing the equipotential plots in the cross section of a dc machine is described. The necessary steps are as follows: 1) scanning of the gridlines in the cross section to find the points of definite magnetic potentials from the discrete vector potential; 2) finding the location of the point of the mesh section containing the given vector potential by interpolation; 3) expressing the positions of the points in rectangular coordinates and finding and printing out all points of the same vector potentials by a CalComp computer. This procedure is carried out for several values of the vector potentials to obtain a comprehensive plot of flux lines."
"After discussing transformer types, vα alues, and location of voltage generators in capacitive ladder networks and equivalent transmission lines, a new electrical technique for locating transformer partial discharges or corona is described. It is based on the measurement of the radio frequency spectra at the transformer terminals. Provided the transforner winding can be approximated to a uniform transmission line for the frequency range considered, the method is shown to be theoretically sound. Measurements on model networks and actual transformers suggest that, at least over certain frequency ranges, the winding can be regarded as a uniform transmission line. Apart from locating corona, the method provides a quick and accurate means of measuring actual transformer α values."
"This paper gives a detailed account of the practical application of the technique of corona location in transformers by radio frequency spectrum analysis. The measurements are similar to the usual NEMA corona measurements taken at the bushing tap with a radio noise meter, except an X-Y recorder is used to plot the corona frequency spectrum and a current probe used at the neutral. The theory outlined in Part I is verified by extensive measurements taken from a model transformer using a pulse generator to represent a corona source, and by computer analysis of simulated transformer networks and by practical results."
"Due to the oscillatory nature of the combination of ac system and ac harmonic filters in an HV-DC transmission scheme, transformer magnetising inrush currents have particularly important effects on the overvoltages and transient behaviour of the scheme."
"The operation of a h.v.d.c. converter station connected to a three- phase power system having a low short-circuit capacity gives rise to a series of special problems which must be treated together in order to produce an economic solution for the whole transmission system. The design of the reactive power supply for such a system is given particular attention and the question of a suitable grid control method for the converters is discussed in connection with the problem as a whole. In this way the complete technical and economic framework for the economic layout of a h.v.d.c. station fed by a weak a.c. system is demonstrated."
"Steady-state firing-angle control errors and ac voltage distortion lead to the production of abnormal voltage harmonics at the dc terminals of HVDC converters; these are in addition to the usually considered \"normal\" harmonics. This paper describes the analysis and a digital computer program by which the normal and abnormal harmonics can be calculated for both 6- and 12-pulse converter operation. Examples of computed values are presented."
"Tests were conducted on a high-voltage overhead direct-current test line. Values of radio interference and corona loss were established for certain conductor configurations and pole spacings. Relations between radio interference and corona loss and some weather variables were evaluated. Insulator leakage currents and induced overhead ground wire currents were investigated."
"An improved capacitively coupled conducting-paper analog to simulate the two-dimensional magnetic vector potential field of multiple uniformly distributed source regions is discussed. A null method is used in obtaining the flux distribution, and a differential probe-amplifier combination is employed in finding flux density infarmation. Output of the analog is readily used to calculate reactance, short-circuit forces, and stray-load losses of power transformers."
"This paper reports on initial numerical experiments for the solution of the nonlinear magnetic field problem by the method of finite elements, a new technique that permits great freedom in prescribing boundary shapes and does not suffer from the deceleration of convergence that plagues the relaxation methods [9]. The sizes of the triangular elements can be freely chosen so that dense clusters of smaller elements exist in the principal regions of interest (usually the iron parts) and fewer large ones in remote air spaces."
"Two methods are developed for evaluating the eddy- current losses occurring in a rectifier transformer during operation, i.e., when carrying pulsating currents. The first is based on the analysis of the whole waveshape; the second starts from the harmonic composition of current curves. Each system is useful from a different point of view, and both achieve the same results. Experimental measurements confirm the theoretical assumption, i.e., that eddy-current losses with pulsating currents can be some multiples higher than those evaluated by the tests prescribed by standards. Eddy-current loss evaluation is made for two-, six-, and twelve-pulse systems."
"Measurement of the sound level of a self-cooled transformer can be made at high ambient levels provided the ambient contains little or no sound from other inductive apparatus at the transformer sound frequencies. By measuring the components of transformer noise through narrow pass-band filters that largely exclude broad-band ambient noise and making a true RMS summation of components mathematically, it is shown that useful measurements can be conducted in ambients as high as eight decibels above the transformer sound level. A beneficial by-product is the detailed description of the frequency composition of transformer noise made available to the designer and user."
"Direct-buried transformer thermal behavior has been studied for 3 years in Ohio. The relationship between a transformer's loadability and its physical and electrical characteristics has been established for this soil environment. Tests show that small transformers can be direct buried, but larger units require supplementary cooling. A heat exchanger utilizing water as the heat- transfer medium reduces transformer operating temperatures dramatically."
"The problem of real-time estimation of the state of a power system is treated from the point of view of the theory of least-squares estimation (Kalman-Bucy filtering). Since under normal operating conditions, the power system behaves in a quasi- static manner, a simple model for the time behavior of the power system is derived. This model, together with the real-time measurement system, enables the design of a tracking state-estimator algorithm. The proposed algorithm has several advantages over the previously suggested static estimator algorithm in regard to its computational aspects, real-time implementation, and the accuracy of the estimated state."
"A precise short-term forecasting method for estimating the status of systems is required for on-line real-time control of complex power systems. In this paper, some state estimation type modelings of load forecasting are introduced, and a few practical problems for applying state estimation are discussed. In [11] the identification algorithms of the covariance matrices of system and observation noise are developed using observed data series, and their experimental results by simulation model are discussed. Results show that forecasting error by the developed method is quickly converged to minimum error of the ideal state estimation with previously known noise properties."

"One aspect of long-range planning of electric power systems involves the exploration of various designs for the bulk power transmission network. The use of linear programming for network analysis to determine where capacity shortages exist and, most importantly, where to add new circuits to relieve the shortages is presented. The new method of network estimation produces a feasible transmission network with near-minimum circuit miles using as input any existing network plus a load and generation schedule. An example is used to present the two steps of the method: 1) linear flow estimation and 2) new circuit selection. The method has become a fundamental part of computer programs for transmission network synthesis."
"This paper describes a new and efficient method for computing a real-time load flow solution of a power system network. The use of line flow measurements is proposed and it is shown that this measurement scheme shows superiority in speed, accuracy and numerical behavior together with advantages in error detection and identification."

"On the basis of transient network analyzer (TNA) and digital computer tests, this paper discusses the possible correct evaluation of switching overvoltages by means of a coordinated use of analog and digital methods, taking into account both frequency- and voltage-dependent parameters. Special emphasis is placed on the transient equivalent of a complex network, its digital computation, and its representation on the TNA. Attention is focused on the range of frequencies involved in the transients following closing operations on lines of intermediate or long length."
"On the basis of transient network analyzer studies this paper discusses the influence of EHV shunt reactors on the overvoltages occurring during breaker operations on transmission systems. The comparative importance of line losses and reactor losses on the decay of the trapped charge voltages that oscillate with frequencies dictated by line capacitances and shunt reactor inductances is analyzed. Emphasis is placed on the influence on these oscillations of different types of faults and line asymmetries."
"This paper describes a method for determining a simplified equivalent mathematical representation of portions of a power system for transient stability analysis. The method leads to equations that do not correspond directly to a system composed of normal power system components. Conditions under which it is possible to obtain such an equivalent are given, and the results of applying the method to the 118-bus IEEE test system are reported."
"Overvoltages on UHV systems may be controlled to a level of 1.5 pu or less. Historically, lightning, line energizing, and line reenergizing overvoltages have been the primary factors in establishing power system design levels. At the new reduced levels, other transients must be considered. Fault initiation and fault clearing transients are investigated using different system configurations. Minimum levels are established by fault initiation transients. Fault clearing overvoltages can be controlled to corresponding levels by the insertion of opening resistors."
"At 1100 kV, transient overvoltages caused by switching transmission lines pose the greatest stress to system insulation. These overvoltages must be limited to realistic values to make 1100- kV transmission economically attractive. Various altematives for limiting switching surges including controlled and uncontrolled multistep resistor breakers are investigated under many different system conditions. Several of these altematives are found to be capable of limiting surge magnitudes to acceptable values."
"Design curves are presented for switching-surge flashover of tower window gaps 20 to 39 feet (6.1 to 11.9 meters), bundle conductor-to-ground gaps spaced 20 to 50 feet (6.1 to 15.2 meters), and bundle conductor-to-tower leg gaps spaced 14 to 29 feet (4.3 to 8.8 meters). The critical flashover voltage range is from 1100 to 2700 kV. Together with the above, the following variables were investigated: time to crest, insulator string length, rain, window-shape, tower width, conductor entrance angle, and conductor configuration. In addition, work was accomplished on standard deviation, time to flashover, and flashover patterns."
"To provide data for design of UHV transmission towers from which system design altemates can be evaluated, switching-and lightning-impulse tests were performed on simulated full-scale transmission towers having a minimum strike distance from 16.3 to 27.8 feet. Although it appears economically undesirable to design 1100-to 1300-kV systems to \"withstand\" a 2.0-pu switching surge, as was done at 550-kV transmission, these tests indicate that this design is technically feasible for 1100-kV transmission. The economic solution appears to be at design levels of 1.5 pu or less."
"Contamination deposits on arrester housings when wetted can cause external flashovers and, by disturbing the voltage distribution on the internal gaps, can lower the power frequency sparkover of the arresters. It has been found that the conditions that produce the lowest external flashover often do not cause the greatest reduction in sparkover. Separate tests are needed to adequately test the flashover of external insulation and the internal sparkover of an arrester. A proposed test is being developed for checking the sparkover characteristic of a wet, contaminated arrester."
"Results of experimental studies on the contamination flashover strength of EHV insulator strings are presented. The results compare favorably with a theoretical analysis by Boehne and Weiner in 1966-1967. Nonlinearity of insulation strength with insulator length has been investigated, employing a steam fog method to simulate natural humidity and fog. The nonlinearity is caused by nonuniform voltage distribution along contaminated insulator strings. Such nonuniform distribution is created by the capacitance of insulator units to ground. This relationship was clearly demonstrated by several indirect methods. The results should be very important in future contamination studies."
"This paper presents results of experimental studies on the flashover strength of ice-coated insulators. Two types of flashover have been found on ice-covered insulators. One is caused by hard and dry ice formed in temperatures lower than 15 °F. Another is caused by mixed conditions of ice and misty rain in relatively high temperatures of 20 to 30 °F. The flashover voltages of 25 units of 53/4- by 10-inch insulators were 288 kV (phase to ground) in the former condition and 246 kV in the latter. These results were obtained for uncontaminated insulators. Nonuniform voltage distribution along the insulator string produces these low flashover voltages. These tests were conducted at General Electric's Project UHV in the winter season of 1968-1969."
"This work makes a comprehensive single phase study of the most commonly observed subharmonic oscillation, that is the one- third order subharmonic. The theoretical methods employed may be extended to other subharmonic frequencies and also to combinations of subharmonics. A theory is developed to enable the calculation of the existence region for all practical cases concerned with static magnetic circuits. Further, in a detailed comparison of the theoretical results of all commonly used static magnetic circuits with the results obtained in experimental studies using a specially designed Transient Network Analyser, TNA, differences of less than 5% in every case were recorded. This TNA includes a new method of simulation of the power transformer and its associated nonlinearities, and an outline of the method of representation is given."
"A new method for calculating the corona current and its effect on high voltage travelling surges is presented. The corona current is computed using the known theories of corona discharges for different surge voltages and conductor sizes. The calculated corona current wave per meter of the line conductor is used in computing the distortion of the voltage surges as they travel along overhead transmission lines. The calculated current and distortion generally agree with previous experimental findings."
"A method for digitally simulating a three phase power system which is subjected to a fault at one location with blown fuses or open conductors at another location is described. The method is applicable when the simultaneous unbalances are on opposite sides of a delta-wye transformer. Employing symmetrical component theory, it is shown that the sequence networks can be connected with a common neutral bus when simulating a fault or open conductor(s). The interconnected sequence networks are represented by node voltage and constraint equations so that solutions for different conditions are easily obtained. Two different techniques were programmed for solving the equations and they are discussed in terms of the number of operations and computer running time. The method also can be used to simulate other types of shunt and series simultaneous unbalances if the sequence constraint equations are known at each unbalance point."
"A new technique is presented for calculating the rate and duration of service interruptions in transmission and distribution systems. The novel features of the technique are that it can be easily applied to large networks, networks with multiple sources, and networks of any configuration, not necessarily series-parallel subsystems. The approach is based on the traditional exponential probability density functions for time to failure and repair time, but it incorporates a new combinatorial algorithm. The paper includes the derivation of equations and the solution of a sample problem using a pilot computer program."
"Physical and chemical analyses done on suspension insulator surface contaminants and fog water collected in the field showed significant water-soluble material in both. At one location the soluble material in both the fog water and surface deposit was gypsum, whereas the insoluble component of the surface deposit was mostly alpha quartz. A laboratory simulation system was used to produce flashover on a single-suspension insulator with contamination conditions and voltage typical of field experience. To achieve this it was required that the laboratory simulation of the fog include a horizontal wind and that of the surface deposit include a substance (bentonite was used here) that would allow water to permeate (spread out) on the surface. The simulation produced the major phenomena believed to occur when suspension insulators suffer contamination flashover."
"This paper considers electrical discharge mechanisms as they occur across relatively dry zones on wet contaminated insulator surfaces. A mathematical model was assumed with constant surface resistivity, and constants were evaluated from experimental results obtained using a simple cylindrical geometry with a dry zone, wet contaminant, and electric stress much like those on suspension insulators."
"A flat plate insulator with concentric electrodes and a fog guard is used to obtain the same qualitative behavior in leakage current and dry zone formation as a suspension insulator in a fog with horizontal wind for comparable levels of contamination and electric stress, thus demonstrating the importance of nonuniform wetting in this case. Attempts at mathematical description of the processes met with only qualitative success."
"Unbalanced periodic voltages and currents applied to transmission lines can be resolved into sets of voltages and currents, each of which is characterized by its own propagation constant and each of which is independent of the others. Each set can then be operated upon separately and recombined at other points of the system. These sets are called normal modes and are unique in possessing these characteristics. The method of resolution is applied both to infinitely long lines and short lines. These modes differ from the generally accepted natural modes."
"This paper continues the analysis of the steady-state performance of transmission lines by means of normal modes. Because of the symmetry of a flat configuration of conductors, important simplifications result which permit presenting the effect of frequency and earth resistivity over a considerable range. The effect of ground wires is also studied, and it is shown that the ratio of the span length to the wavelength of the applied frequency is an important factor. For small values of this ratio the systém can be reduced to a simpler equivalent system. When the ratio is near unity an accurate solution is more difficult."
"General equations are presented and derived which enable the accurate calculation of fault currents in overhead transmission line ground wires at any point along the ground wire to either side of the point of fault, given the fault current contribution from both terminals of the line. The equations are based on uniform tower footing resistance, which is treated as uniformly distributed conductance between ground wire and ground. The results, easily and inexpensively calculated by digital computer, are compared with test measurements previously published and excellent agreement is indicated."
"A method for predicting the probability of lightning strokes to transmission lines and the shielding effect of ground wires is presented. This method, which is based on electromagnetic field concepts, also makes it possible to determine which parts of the system (ground wires, phase wires, etc.) are more attractive to various lightning strokes for a given geometrical configuration of the transmission line. The study presented showsthat the area \" covered\" by a transmission system, in which every lightning strikes the transmission line, and the shielding angle are not constant. They are a function of the down-going charges from the cloud and the configuration of the transmission line and cannot be expressed by simple geometrical methods."
"This paper develops a method for calculating the required dc field current of a three-phase synchronous ac generator for known dc load conditions and machine characteristics. The method is simple to apply and has shown good agreement with test data. The method is of utility for preliminary design and analysis of rectified output alternators, such as may be used in excitation systems of the largest ac generators, space vehicle power applications, or high-power industrial rectification."
"The construction methods of some water-cooled turbogenerators require a closer examination of coil eddy current suppression by means of novel transpositions. A digital computer model is described which allows examination of the performance of many new transposition types. These transpositions are described, a comparative table of performance is given for a particular machine examined, and conclusions are drawn about the utility of some of the transpositions."
"It is shown that electromagnetically induced vibratory forces on the stator windings of large turbine-generators can be substantially reduced by using winding arrangements that permit an increased number of stator slots. Three methods for doing this without increasing the generator voltage are described: delta-connected windings, a new three-phase winding system using variable-pitch coils, and a \" multi-three-phase\" system using a six-phase generator, six buses, and a six-phase-three-phase power conversion in the generator stepup transformers. Generator voltages may be equal to, or slightly lower than, present levels. In some cases bus and transformer costs may be slightly higher, but this will be more than offset if the generator availability (over the life of the equipment) is increased by even a few days because of the reduced duty. Additional benefits in the generator design, in operating characteristics, and in the ability to build larger kVA ratings are described."
"The paper describes the solutions developed for direct cooling of turboalternator rotors. On the basis of calculations relating to the rotor of a 800-MW alternator, the different constructional solutions are compared from the aspect of cooling efficiency. On the basis of the results of the calculations, it is established that in addition to the water-cooling solutions the most efficient one is the gas-cooling layout based on the gap-pickup principle, where the cooling gas streams in transverse channels of small cross section. It is demonstrated that only water-cooling solutions provided with many parallel branches can compete with this gas- cooling system."
"Extensive evaluation of the electrical and thermal capabilities of insulation systems has been done throughout the industry. Although virtually all large rotating machine insulation system failures are due to mechanical duty, until recent years, only a modest amount of mechanical testing has been done on insulation systems."
"The complex considerations associated with the design and demonstration of short-circuit withstand capability in power transformers are discussed. A model testing technique is described as a means of defining failure modes and failure stresses. One failure mode involving buckling of a winding subjected to inward radial forces is analyzed on a dynamic basis. Alternative means of capability demonstration are proposed and additional experience with the recurrent surge generator method of failure detection is presented."
"The effect of free conducting particles (FCPs) on the voltage-insulating performance of a short length of transmission line was quantitatively studied over the pressure range 0 to 300 psig for nitrogen and 0 to 125 psig for SF6. The FCPs were selected aluminum filings deliberately inserted into the concentric cylindrical (3\"×10\" dia.) electrode system. DC voltages of either polarity were produced by a Van de Graaff generator. The observed forms of interelectrode current included intermittent pulses or 'bursts', 'fireflies', steady corona, and sparks. Up to five-fold reductions in the current-onset voltage insulating strength resulted from the introduction of FCPs. For pressures up to 75 psig the sparking voltage in SF6 was 4 to 5 times higher than the sparking value in nitrogen. An electrostatic particle trap proved effective in reducing FCP-caused discharges. The dynamic equilibrium mechanism of 'fireflies' was studied in detail."
"This paper reviews the basic theory of convection and radiation in gases and presents general formulae which can be used to calculate the heat transfer in any gas. The heat transfer characteristics of air and SF6 at several pressures and in several practical geometries are then derived using these formulae."
"This paper describes the dielectric characteristics of compressed gas insulated cables, particularly the dielectric performances of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) gas and also of the insulating spacers."
"The experimentally measured ac losses in superconducting niobium of a size and shape suitable for practical power cables has been shown to be of such small magnitude that ac superconducting cables warrant serious consideration."
"The measured dissipation factor and breakdown strength of certain dielectric materials impregnated with cryogenic liquids suitable for cryogenic cable application are presented. The separate and combined influence of different factors which affect dielectric loss and breakdown strength are discussed."
"An SF6 power circuit breaker for EHV service at 550 kV and 765 kV is described. Redesign and modification of the existing structure has reduced the number of modules required at 550 kV and has uprated the three module design for 765 kV application. The dielectric strength has been increased by increasing the minimum operating gas pressure from 30 psig to 45 psig. Control of moisture is insured by the addition of large driers in the gas circulating system and careful attention to installation and servicing procedures. Switching surge control is provided by resistor insertion on closing, with additional control available in the form of two-step resistor closing. Modular construction permits verification of the breaker ratings by testing a single module or a single break. Preliminary development tests on a single break and a single column have verified the adequacy of the design for 550 kV and 765 kV circuit breaker applications."
"A new line of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas filled high voltage circuit breakers is now available. These breakers are of dead tank design, and use SF6 gas for insulation as well as for interruption. The breaker assembly consists of three pole units and one operating mechanism on a single base. The moving contacts are mechanically linked to the operating mechanism."
"This paper covers the derivation of a short line fault equation for the maximum rate of rise of recovery voltage (RRRV) characteristic of gas blast interrupters. It is shown that the maximum RRRV is 1) approximately proportional to the gas pressure; 2) proportional to the effective nozzle arc length at current zero and the number of series breaks, 3) inversely proportional to the 3/2 power of the rate of change of current, and 4) proportional to a coefficient that is a function of gas properties. Based on assumptions concerning air and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) arc temperatures, the equation indicates the superior interrupting ability of SF6 for identical conditions of pressure, current, and interrupter assembly."
"Possible mechanisms of spark breakdown in SF6 and other electronegative gases are discussed, and quantitative criteria are derived for the Townsend type and the streamer type of breakdown in nonuniform fields. The Townsend criterion is of considerable physical interest but difficult to apply to engineering problems, whereas the semi-empirical streamer criterion, which holds for impulse breakdown, can be applied to any gap geometry of known field distribution."
"A theory suitable for numerical control of static converters is developed as an alternative to the analog-type methods in existence. The basic feature of the new method is the introduction of a new control parameter, the phase of firing, which unlike the conventional ones (α,β) is independent of the shape and unbalance of the voltage waveforms."
"The paper describes the hardware and operation of a direct digital control of static converters for HVDC transmission. It is shown that the new control offers considerable advantage over the existing analog-based method in terms of speed, accuracy, and reliability."
"An evaluation is made of the dynamic performance of a three-ended dc transmission line superimposed on an ac network. The dc line is equipped with a control system which modulates the power flow on the dc line to provide dynamic damping during various disturbances in the combined ac/dc system. Some of the problems and limitations of such a system are discussed."
"An exact solution to the problem of transmission line losses with respect to load scheduling is becoming more and more important in view of the large size of the systems. A formulation for this, including the system constraints as a nonlinear programming problem, was first proposed by Carpentier. It is shown that the dimension of the problem can be reduced by considering bus voltage variables alone as problem variables. A penalty function approach for the solution of this problem is described which is computationally more efficient than some of the earlier methods. Finally, two methods for computing the optimal solutions for small changes in loads are described."
"Having set forth general information on Italy's power system, the paper discusses the reasons why a considerable expansion of pumping stations is anticipated in this country. With reference to some of the hydroelectric pumped-storage stations existing or under construction in Italy, a few considerations are made concerning the characteristics which such stations can assume with respect to hourly, daily, weekly and seasonal regulation, integration and reserve."

      "The design of horizontal deflection systems is usually determined empirically by experienced electronic engineers. The use of equations and formulas is, in general, unsatisfactory. They require many hours to solve and the results are, at best, only approximate."
"Electronic tuning for AM radios becomes possible with today's varactor diodes. The large capacitance values available permit smaller AM radios and remote tuning. Utilization of varactor diode tuning, however, demands extreme voltage stability, since small changes in the tuner reference voltage will change the diode capacitance and therefore the resonant frequency."
"Unlike black and white televisionreceivers, a color televisionreceiver only permits moderate detuning before color picture quality deteriorates."
"The use of microstrip with varactor diodes to construct a UHF tuner for commercial television receivers is a marked departure from previous exploitations of microstrip. Usually, it has been used for network elements in broadband applications with fixed center frequency. Such applications are diametrically opposed to the conditions in UHF receivers, where fractional bandwidths less than 5% are required over nearly an octave variation of center frequency. The scope of this paper is a discussion of the most fundamental problems associated with microstrip in varactor-tuned UHF tuners. These problems are as follows: 1. Determination of parametric relationships 2. Delineation of device limitations 3. Formation of an approach to preselection"
 "Increasing use of semiconductors in color TV circuitry has permitted the evolution of many different methods for color sub-carrier regeneration. This chassis function is a major contributor to color picture quality since phase errors introduced in the regeneration process can result in tint errors easily discernible by the most unskilled viewer. The solid state circuits commonly used or recommended for use in this area may be classified by operating principles as follows: 1) Automatic phase control (APC) loops 2) Injection locked oscillators 3) Crystal ringing circuits."
"One of the problems associated with horizontal deflection and high voltage systems utilizing third harmonic tuning of the flyback transformer for large screen color TV (25\"-90°tubes) has been the high voltage regulation. In tube sets, the shunt regulator has been widely used; and, more recently, a feedback scheme to the horizontal output tube has been used to achieve better regulation. However, the shunt regulator has proved undesirable because of reliability, and it is a potential source of X-rays. The feedback scheme does not lend itself to transistor circuitry because the horizontal transistor is operated as a switch. Therefore, in making a transition to transistor horizontal deflection and high voltage systems, regulation becomes a problem."
"The superheterodyne receiver was first described in 1919,1 and in a discussion of choice of intermediate frequency which acompanied that description the possibility of multiple responses was first suggested.2 Thus, the receiver spurious response has reached its golden anniversary, and like many an old timer it provokes disinterest if not outright boredom. In spite of the variety of transistors and other devices newly available to designers in the past decade, no documented improvement in receiver spurious response performance has been achieved. Apparently it is assumed that there is an adequate knowledge of the mechanisms of spurious responses, methods for the measurement of same and design techniques for their reduction. The results presented here indicate that much design improvement is possible, for it was found that the cross modulation performance of a production FM tuner could be improved by 50 dB simply by replacing the mixer transistor with another having different characteristics."
"Proposals for home color television receivers which would provide for more than just the display of broadcast programs usually have centered around the inclusion of a color video tape recording system. A comparison of closed circuit television systems for conventional color film with systems for color video tape recording suggests greater potential for film systems."
"Portable, transistorized television receivers are usually designed to operate from 12 volts DC. The converter for AC power line operation in most TV sets is built in, but in a few sets it may be in a small box at the AC prong end of the line cord. A cigarette lighter plug in cord accessory is usually supplied for operating the set from an external 12 volt battery as is found in most automobiles, boats, private airplanes, etc."

  "Dual-gate MOSFETs in an FM tuner provide many advantages over bipolar, junction field-effect, and single-gate MOS field-effect transistors. RF amplification and mixing are aided by use of a low-feedback-capacitance transistor with low noise figure and large dynamic range. A second gate is available for either AGC or local oscillator injection. High stable RF and conversion gains are easily obtained with inexpensive, commercially available coils and without need for neutralization. This paper presents test data and design tips which can be used to design with the SFB8970* dual-gate MOSFET at 100 MHz. The SFB8970 is an N-channel, depletion mode, dual-gate, MOS transistor with integral back-to-back zener diodes between both gates and the source to eliminate the need for special precautionary handling procedures."
 "Any device capable of accelerating electrons to an energy of several thousand electrons volts can be a source of X-radiation. Color television receivers have been shown to produce amounts of X-rays in excess of the recommendations of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP), under certain conditions of construction and operation (Refs. 2,3,4,5,6,7). The X-rays may be produced by shunt regulator, high voltage rectifier and picture tubes, and the penetrability of the emissions is sufficient to create hazardous conditions for the lens of the eye, thyroid, male gonads, and some bone marrow (Refs. 2,8,9,10,11). This study was conducted to determine the variables affecting the X-ray protective properties of selected glasses and bonding resins used in the manufacture of color television picture tubes."
"More reliable solid-state color television receivers have been requested for a long time. However, since the deflection and high voltage circuits must handle the larger power and higher voltage essentially, then, it has been thought that the semiconductorization of the deflection circuit is very difficult, especially in the case of the larger size color set."
"The design of a dual gate MOSFET amplifier is, in theory, simpler than that of a bipolar amplifier because of the very low feedback associated with the dual gate device. When feedback is low enough to be neglected, the input impedance Zi= 1/Y11; the output impedance Zo = 1/Y22; and the voltage gain Vo/Vi = Y21RL, where RL is the total parallel resistance across the output tuned circuit, and includes ReY22."
"Historically, flyback design has been considered an art rather than a science. Despite a great deal of published theoretical analysis (Ref. 2,3, 4,5, and 6), the actual development of a flyback is often done empirically. The theory is sufficiently cumbersome and complicated to deter an engineer from using it."
"Convergence of the three color beams in an in-line gun cathode ray tube is a relatively easy task. The three unconverged rasters are parallel and differ only in size. Convergence of the electron beams of the two outermost guns upon the electron beam of the center gun is accomplished by adjusting the amplitude of a sawtooth current, which can be used because the convergence errors at the North and South and at the East and West areas of the screen are equal and in opposite directions. Since amplitude rather than wave-shaping controls are used, the number of dynamic controls can be significantly reduced from the thirteen used in the conventional delta gun system. Each of the two outermost electron guns has only two static and two dynamic convergence adjustments. The dynamic controls use the horizontal rate deflection yoke current to converge the vertical lines and the vertical rate deflection yoke current to converge the horizontal lines. A prototype assembly is shown in Fig. 1. The improved system designed by Sylvania now makes it possible to achieve convergence that is equal to the convergence obtained with the delta gun system."
"Color television is a useful area for application of integrated circuits. In particular, the demodulator section offers the possibility of using several integrated circuits provided the economy of each IC is assured by a sufficient replacement value in terms of discrete components it replaces. Under technological constraints of crystal size and power dissipation, the choice of a low voltage supply and low signal levels have the advantage of a higher replacement value then the high-voltage approach. Finally a proposal is made to integrate all the color processing IC's into one IC, encapsulated into a 16 lead package."
"When designing all-solid-state colour receivers, most stingent problems are usually encountered in the horizontal deflection stage. The large switching power to be handled by the output device and the inherent danger in CRT arcing of the 25 kV ultor voltage generated in this stage present considerable problems to the designer as well as to the solid state devices."

 "The advent of the 110°color picture tube has increased the performance requirements for deflection, convergence and correction circuitry, which can be met by the circuits described in this paper."
"A current drive transformerless vertical deflection system is presented. The system employes a constant current source and variable current source with a complementary current amplifier output to function as a bidirectional current source."
"In a color television system the frequency components of the luminance and the chrominance signals consist of line spectra, the component frequencies of which are separated by harmonics of the line frequency. By being interleaved betwee. n the luminance frequencies, the chrominance frequencies share the passband near its high frequency end. The detected luminance signal in a receiver contains the color subcarrier, which produces an image with crawling dots and edges."
"A monolithic signal processing system which provides the AGC and sync. separation functions for a television receiver. Internal noise protection is provided for both functions. There is no noise threshold nor AGC detector level adjustment. Provision is made for both negative-and positive-going separated sync. output. Also included is a low impedance video output for driving the luminance channel or a video output stage."
"The development of a multifunction integrated circuit which processes the detected video signals in a NTSC color television is described. A first generation IC has been produced which regenerates the color subcarrier using APC loop techniques. A gain controllable, chroma amplifier is also included on the chip. This IC represents the first step in a program to develop a high performance, low cost, single chip chroma processing system. Careful consideration has been given to system partitioning to maximize functional capabilities while maintaining flexibility and low cost. A detailed description of the subcarrier regenerator and chroma amplifier is given in Section II and Section III. The overall circuit organization is discussed in Section IV."
"A power supply system for colour receivers is described. Stabilization of various output voltages is achieved by a single control system switching at the horizontal time base frequency. Mains isolation is included in the ferroxcube transformer which has also windings to supply the CRT heater and to drive the base of a horizontal output transistor."
"A novel TV sync system is described that eliminates the conventional horizontal oscillator, thereby minimizing the possibility of spurious side-locking. Selective filtering at the horizontal frequency by a dual-mode gyrator filter provides high performance with respect to noise immunity, phase stability and elimination of deleterious effects due to the vertical sync interval."
"The circuit described is designed for portable AM-only or AM/FM receivers and aimed at optimal flexibility together with maximum economical feasibility. Conventional system approach is employed."
"A novel monolithic IC for sync circuit comprised of a sync amplifier, a horizontal oscillator with AFC, and a vertical oscillator has been developed. To avoid the use of expensive inductive components, both horizontal and vertical oscillator circuits are composed of multivibrators. The 55 x 67 mil chip, containing 21 transistors, 14 diodes and 34 resistors, is sealed in a conventional 14-pin dual-in-line package. This IC for sync circuit can save 26 discrete components and can be used in all screen sizes of TV receivers. Use of this IC in production of monochrome TV receivers has resulted in improved performance, greater reliability and reduced assembly cost."
"When transmitter channel spacing is small and the signal level at the receiver input is very high, a considerable degradation in the performance of the receiver may occur, particularly in the case of transistorized FM-front ends."
"A network is deve loped which can be used with a voltage variable capacitance diode (varicap) to obtain a variety of capacitance versus voltage characteristics. This approach is useful when the shape of the capacitance versus voltage characteristic of available varicaps is not suitable for a particular application. A television color sub-carrier A.P.C. system is given as a practical example where this technique is used to produce symmetrical behavior with respect to hold-in and pull-in."
"By setting n, normally being two, for the power-law exponent constant of the transfer characteristic of Field Effect Transistors (FETs), the cross modulation distortion characteristic of a high frequency amplifier and the conversion gain of a frequency mixer are obtained and compared with the measured values. At the same time, considering the Integrated Circuit (IC) form of a tuner, a local oscillator is also construted by a FET and the frequency stability is investigted"

"Two new high-gain FM-IF linear integrated circuits (IC's) are now commercially available. These devices provide the cost and performance advantages generally associated with integrated circuits and are well suited for all FM-IF applications including automobile radio. This paper describes the application and design feature of two circuits: a high-gain amplifier limiter RCA CA3076 and an RCA CA3075 FM subsystem which employs a newly developed differential peak-detection method."
"The development of the high capacitance, wide range variable capacitor has made possible the construction of resistance-capacitance networks in which both R and C can be varied in a predetermined relationship with a single control. Functions which previously were technically or economically impractical can now be obtained with relative ease. Construction and operation of variable networks in several practical circuits is discussed."
"Linear phase 10.7 MHZ IF amplifier filters can offer many advantages such as lower and improved stereo multiplex performance over tose having a rectangular response characteristic. Design procedures, possibilities for filter grouping and experimental results with Linear Phase and Butterworth filters are presented. Designs are oriented toward using readily available low cost components."
"Although it was claimed that linear integrated circuits provided cost savings and improved reliability, the introduction of these circuits to consumer applications requiring selectivity was not immediate. In reviewing the IC's, it became obvious that the cost of selectivity negated some of the advantages that were gained by their use."
"A discussion of receiver phase characteristics and how it affects TV and FM signals."
"There are two approaches to computer aided design of an I. F. amplifier. The first is the logical extension of replacing the slide rule with the computer in an analytical design."
"This paper relates to an automatic synchronizing system for line and frame circuits in television receivers, especially for color television. Color television is a useful area for application of logic combination with IC. Vertical automatic sync circuit is composed of APC loop and countdown circuits from line frequency with MOS IC."
"The paper reports on a method for transmitting several audio signals within the video-signal spectrum so that, e.g. during satellite transmissions, audio signals associated with the picture can be transmitted and received-in several languages. The audio signals, each in one idle line, are transmitted in a time-compressed form during the vertical flyback. At the receiver the audio signal of the desired language is selected by a line selector, then stored e.g. in a MOS-storage and, in the original mode. retransmitted with a bandwidth of about 13 kHz to the sound amplifier during the consecutive frame."
"This paper presents a simple, straightforward analysis of a Foster-Seeley discriminator. Because this analysis differs from the classical approach, it can be seen that there are two distinct sources of distortion. These sources are the resonant circuit of the discriminator and the output portion of the circuit. An analytic proof of the linearity of the output portion is given. It is shown that the resonant circuit is the dominant source of distortion and that it may be minimized by proper selection of circuit components."
"Television receiver AGC Systems are basically discussed in connection with the black level performance and the transient response of the system."
 "Recent research work at McIntosh Laboratory has led to the development of a new selective, linear-phase FM-IF filter. In order to fully realize the potential of this new filter in a complete tuner, a new linear-phase FM discriminator circuit has been developed to complement this IF filter."
"In this paper the problem of representing the composite video signal for monochromatic T. V. transmission is examined and a method for computing the required spectral bandwidth is devised suitable for computer applications. The results obtained numerically are compared to measured results and to analytical solutions for a determinate signal for special cases. Comparison is made with some \"maximum horizontal resolution\" methods with a resulting decrease in bandwidth requirements for most applications."

  "Departure of semiconductor-device performance from that expected on the basis of first-order models is often attributed to surface effects. One surface effect, channel conduction, is considered in terms of its relation to the electrical charge behavior of organic or inorganic dielectric films on semiconductor surfaces. Two cases of device failure due to charge instabilities in inorganic and organic dielectric layers are presented. In one, sodium ions drift in silicon oxide to induce a channel on a p-wall isolation region. Sodium ions can be sealed outside the oxide, thus preventing the drift and failure, by using silicon nitride as an ion barrier. A second example of dielectric-related device failure involves a plastic-encapsulated device. In this case, burn-in testing induces the migration of negative charges at the plastic-inorganic dielectric interface over an n-type region. The latter is inverted to p type. The resulting channel leakage current exceeds allowable limits and failure results."
"A chart is given of comparative physical properties of silicon and the principal insulating films used with silicon, namely, silicon dioxide, silicon monoxide, silicon nitride, and aluminum oxide. The interplay of these physical characteristics is discussed. Included is a brief review of methods of forming these films, since the method of formation influences the physical properties of the final film. In the case of silicon dioxide, a comparison is also made between the amorphous or glassy state and the principal crystal form, α-quartz."
"The rapid progress of aerospace technology relative to ultrahigh-speed aircraft has necessitated a reevaluation of electronic insulation with respect to high-temperature environments. A description of the processes that contribute to polymer degradation is presented to alert the electronic system's engineer to the possible insulation problems arising from high frequency and elevated temperatures. Glass-and quartz-fabric-reinforced polymers are evaluated for application in high-temperature microwave systems. Polyester, diallyl isophthalate, diolefin, epoxy, silicone, polyimide, and poly-benzimidazole laminating systems were investigated. The molding capabilities and laminating conditions of these materials in prepreg form are reviewed with respect to degree of porosity and production difficulty that may be encountered in molding thin, intricately designed parts. To determine the suitability of these laminates for high-temperature ure environments, consideration is given to weight loss and flexural strength as a function of temperature and thermal aging. The compatibility of these composites in microwave applications is determined by measuring their dielectric constant and dissipation actor at 1010 Hz and at various operating temperatures."
"Strip-line methods for measuring dielectric constants and loss tangent of sheet insulation, particularly of strip-line laminates, offer advantages for laboratory study and routine quality control of microwave dielectric properties at frequencies above 1 GHz. Theoretical and practical problems are discussed including possible strip circuit test patterns, effects of air gaps, correction for fringing field, adaptability to different dielectric thicknesses, and the relation of the measured loaded Q to both the unloaded Q of resonant strips and the dissipation factor of the dielectric period. Band-stop and band-pass filter test fixtures and measuring arrangements are described which are suitable for laboratory measurements or, when the filter circuit is made a permanent part of the fixture, for rapid and precise quality control testing. Dielectric properties measured at X-band (8-12 GHz) are given for a number of materials. Data are also included on the variability of copper-clad glass cloth-reinforced polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and the dependence of apparent dielectric constant on clamping pressure and test temperature."

 "A definite deviation from the Eyring behavior (in fm/T α 1/T) is found to occur with cable-insulating oils studied over the frequency range extending from 30 Hz to 100 MHz at temperatures between -80° and 27°C. The obtained activation parameters of dipole orientation in the oils exhibit a marked temperature dependence. The results indicate that changes occur in the dipole relaxation mechanism with temperature, and that dipole orientation involves an appreciable rearrangement of the molecules in the neighborhood of the rotating dipoles."
"Knowing that oil is a weak link in a composite or impregnated dielectric system with reference to both dielectric strength and ease of contamination, many investigators have devoted great efforts to try to ascertain the best types of oil for various operating conditions. However, different investigators seem to have different opinions as to the best-suited type of oil for this purpose. It is the object of this study to involve a wide variety of oils and test conditions to shed some light on this controversy. Ten original oils and three blended samples selected from an array of over 50 original specimens tested have been chosen to illustrate the tenacity of this problem. The samples include both mineral and synthetic oils, coming from domestic sources as well as from abroad. Their sources or ethnic groupings seem to indicate no preference, but the care in refining these samples seems to be a factor. In this investigation, two criteria have been chosen to indicate the service quality of the oils: gas-absorption and liberation characteristics and electrical deterioration under moderate electrical stress. In the presence of carbon dioxide, no oil has been found to liberate gases. In the presence of air, nitrogen, or oxygen, although gas liberation has been observed in some of the European oils at some stages of aging, there has been no sharp rise in dissipation factor or indication of internal discharge or failure."
"A comparison is made between several distribution functions of dielectric relaxation times, their corresponding frequency-dependent permittivities, and the resulting Argand diagrams. For each family of distributions, the shape of the Argand diagram changes only slowly with the parameters in the distribution. In most cases, rigorous procedures are necessary before a distribution function can be uniquely determined from experimental data."
"Thermal aging studies were conducted on four encapsulated insulation systems on motorettes to establish their thermal rating. Encapsulation of Class-A and class-B insulation systems was found to upgrade a Class-A system from 105 to 138°C and a Class-B system from 130 to greater than 150°C. The effect of thermal shock on the thermal life is demonstrated to reduce the thermal life by a factor of 10."

 "The electric strengths and time lags to breakdown in NaC1 single crystals have been measured using flat-topped impulse voltages with and without ultraviolet irradiation. The results show that radiation reduces the mean electric strength of annealed, unannealed, and plastically deformed specimens, but has no significant effect on the mean statistical time lag. Plastic deformation increases and annealing decreases both the electric strength and time lag. An increase in specimen thickness or an increase in overvoltage also causes a decrease in the mean statistical time lag. All observed phenomena can be explained by a lti-multielectron-avalanche mechanism."
"The electric strengths of n hexane and transformer oil have been measured at various pressures using linearly rising voltages having rates of rise between 50 kV/cm/μs and 20 MV/ cm/μs. Each measurement was made by applying a single pulse of sufficient magnitude to ensure breakdown in order to avoid the possible influence of prestressing with the normal multipulse technique. For both liquids the electric strengths are strongly dependent on the rate of rise of the applied field and on hydrostatic pressure, but the pressure dependence diminishes with increasing rate of rise of the applied field, and at rates of rise higher than about 4 MV/cm/μs the pressure dependence practically disappears. The results indicate that a certain time may be required for bubbles to form and deform in an electrically stressed liquid and that the bubble mechanism may not be operative in the breakdown process for fast-rising voltages."
"The purpose of this paper is to interpret the experimental results presented earlier under the same subject on gassing characteristics of the oils, on the effects of copper catalyst and electrical stress on electrical deterioration, and on ways and means to preserve electrical-insulating oils from contamination and deterioration. The effects of the presence of a copper catalyst and electrical stress have been carefully examined, the most nonreactive gas for oil quality preservation is pinpointed, the fundamentals of gassing behavior are clarified, and the probable mechanism of oil deterioration under the various atmospheric gases is discussed. With the conclusions clearly pointing out what to expect and what to avoid in the treatment and use of electrical-insulating oils, it is hoped that some contribution to this knowledge has been rendered in a small way."
"The electrical avalanche mechanism that can occur in an insulation system is discussed and followed by an analysis of results of corona measurements on insulation systems containing artificial voids and on transformer insulation systems subjected to ac and/or dc electrical stresses. The object of this presentation is to show where the measured results correlate with existing corona models and where they do not. Emphasis is placed on the reproducibility of test results, and a method for making quick but reliable corona tests is described."
"Helium-oxygen mixtures are being considered for use in low-pressure (3.5 to 7.5 psia) compartments of manned spacecraft. Electrical wires, cabling, and components will be required to operate in these low-pressure compartments. During extra-vehicular maneuvers the pressure could decrease to that of space vacuum. During the depressurization and pressurization periods, corona and voltage breakdown will be a significant problem. This paper provides corona and voltage-breakdown data for electrical system components operating in these possible spacecraft environments. The breakdown voltage in pure helium, pure oxygen, and helium-oxygen mixtures is presented as measured between 5-cm-diameter parallel plates at various pressures and spacings at a frequency of 400 Hz and a temperature of 23°C. In addition, the corona onset voltages of twisted and spaced-parallel Teflon-insulated wires and wired connector contacts are presented."
"Cryogenic liquids have unusual physical properties. At low-voltage stress the dielectric loss in the cryogenic liquid is so small that it can not be accurately measured. As the voltage stress is increased, the dissipation factor increases to the order of 0.002, which is higher than for many conventional dielectric liquids. Both the voltage and the time of application influence the dielectric loss. Voltage breakdown is relatively high in both liquid hydrogen and liquid nitrogen. When pressure is increased somewhat at constant temperature to eliminate boiling, the electric strength is increased significantly. When the pressure is increased still further, the electric strength of the cryogenic liquid shows little or no additional increase. Cryogenic liquids have potential use as dielectrics in cable and other types of electrical apparatus. Studies of their dielectric prop-properties may improve the basic understanding of dielectric performance also."

 "A study has been made of the partial discharge characteristics of artificial cavities in polyethylene under combined 60-Hz and negative 1.2/50-μs impulse stresses, the amplitude of the altemating stress being below discharge inception value. Samples of cross-linked and low-density polyethylenes were tested. The discharge sequence was derived from the results of previous tests, which used only impulse stresses. It showed that the ac discharges, initiated by an impulse, could continue indefinitely under certain conditions. The experimental results do not confirm this but show that the ac discharges always extinguish within 10 seconds after the application of the impulse. The number of ac discharges, although independent of the amplitude of the impulse, increases with increasing altemating stress but decreases as the sample ages. The effect of the angle of the cycle at which the impulse was applied on the combined discharge inception stress is also described."
"While the intrinsic electric strength of polymeric insulating materials is of the order of hundreds of kilovolts per millimeter, the service stress in actual insulations is lower by approximately two orders of magnitude. The objective of the work described in this paper is to establish how much the electric strength of polymers is affected by the following factors, in which there is a difference between measurement of intrinsic electric strength on one side and stressing of the insulation under service conditions on the other: stressing with ac or impulse voltage instead of dc, increasing the size of the insulation, and increasing the duration of stressing, all in the absence of internal corona. It is found that even with intrinsic test specimens, in which there are believed to be no discharges, the electric strength decreases with the area of the test specimen and with the duration of stress. The formulas of the statistical theory of extreme values are applied to experimental results obtained on some polymers. If these are used for extrapolation to insulation sizes and lives typical of actual insulations, a considerable reduction of the breakdown stress results even in the absence of internal corona."
"A comparative study has been carried out on the dielectric-loss behavior of kraft-paper cable models impregnated with standard insulating oils and silicone liquids of the same viscosity range. It has been found that the ionic conduction losses in the solid-liquid systems are more affected by the viscosity than the chemical structure of the impregnant. Cable models impregnated with the low-viscosity silicone impregnant exhibited appreciable contamination effects; however, the associated space-charge-loss mechanism with these models caused the overall dielectric-loss magnitude to diminish over an appreciable range of field strengths. This was not found to be the case with the high-viscosity oil and silicone impregnants."
"Results of 60-Hz breakdown tests of transformer oil obtained with 3-, 15-, and 30-cm-diameter brass, copper, and aluminum electrodes are analyzed. The influence of the electrode area as well as the influence of different electrode materials is shown. It is suggested that for evaluation purposes of transformer oil, the statistical occurrence of the minimum, mean, and maximum values should be applied instead of the test values obtained with American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM), British Standards (BS), or Verein Deutscher Elektrotechniker (VDE) tests."

 "When skin is mechanically stimulated, differentreceptor systems will be activated depending upon the type of skin stimulated and stimulus characteristics such as rate and amplitude of displacement and repetition frequency. The general properties of the primary mechano-receptive units are (for the rapidly adapting intracutaneous receptors) low thresholds, restricted receptive field, relatively good rate sensitivity (in terms of repetitive impulse discharge), and poor capacity of tracking on high-frequency repetitive stimulation; (for the Pacinian corpuscles) high critical slope, very low displacement threshold, diffuse receptive field, poor rate sensitivity, and good frequency-following capacity; (for the tactile spots in hairy skin) low displacement threshold, small receptive field, good rate sensitivity, and good frequency-following capacity. When tactile displays are designed, the stimulus parameters will have to be chosen according to the psychophysical functions as well as to the receptor properties, in order to obtain a device that is optimal from a discriminatory point of view."
"An experiment is described that tested subjects' ability to recognize letters presented tactually by an array of airjets in a manner simulating a moving belt. Recognition accuracy was measured as a function of reading rate and stimulator frequency. For constant stimulus pulsewidth, performance increased significantly as stimulator-repetition rate was increased from 20 to 160 pps. A second experiment is discussed that is designed to measure the spatial resolution of two hypothetical neural systems, which are the basis for tactile sensations. The data presented indicate that sensitivity to differences in amplitudes of two stimulators is comparable for spacings of 6-10mm on the fingertip. At spacings of 2 mm there is a significant difference between the two systems with the superior resolution obtained at the high frequencies."
"In psychophysical experiments subjects always produce responses that are not nearly as constant as the stimuli presented in laboratory conditions. In this study the fluctuation of responses is described as originating in the nervous system. This description requires a definition of three quantities: a measure for the total neural activity elicited by the stimulus, the fluctuation of this activity about the mean, and the criterion value set by the subject. The method is used in the case of electrical and tactile pulses applied to the skin. This experiment is extended to the case where the test pulse is masked by another simultaneous pulse at an adjacent location. Also, in many learning experiments the response does not improve from trial to trial but it is the mean of fluctuating responses, which shows a learning phenomenon. Here again a theoretical description requires the definition of three quantities: a measure for the state of the nervous system telling its aptitude to show the required response, the fluctuation of this aptitude about the mean, and the criterion value set by the experimental environment. These theoretical considerations are applied to the learning of a compensatory tracking task with two different displays: a visual display and a tactile display."
"An investigation of the subjective magnitude of vibrotaction was undertaken in order to 1) determine the growth of sensation as a function of intensity at a number of different frequencies; 2) establish contours of equal subjective intensity for vibrotaction; and 3) compare the psychophysical methods of direct scaling and intensity matching for a wide range of intensity and frequency. The results show that the growth of sensation is a power function having a slope of about 0.89 for frequencies up to 350 Hz. Near the threshold of detectability the subjective magnitude is proportional to the physical intensity. Contours of equal subjective magnitude were established at eleven levels of intensity and across ten frequencies. It is clearly shown that data obtained by direct scaling and by interfrequency-intensity matching are comparable."
"The most rapid acquisition of skill in the use of complex vibrotactile displays will occur when the capabilities of the organism are most efficiently exploited by the display code. When spatiotemporal patterns are chosen as the coding scheme, the problem of perception of temporal order is of great importance. The present paper describes the effects on the limen for order of two events, of the quality of the stimuli, their spacing on the body, and their intensive relations. The results suggest the presence of limiting conditions for the spatial and, by analogy, the temporal density of vibrotactile patterns. Comparisons are made with results reported previously, and a hypothesis is developed concerning the onset and timing of stimuli in relation to the capacity of the nervous system to augment the clarity of sensory events and to transfer the argumentation to successive locations on the sensory surface."
"The skin can be used for sound localization with accuracy nearly as good as that for hearing. However, auditory sound localization is based on the utilization of both intensive-difference and temporal-difference cues while cutaneous sound localization is based almost entirely on the utilization of only intensive-difference cues. Furthermore, the time interval necessary for resolving two temporally separated pulses was found to be 2.0 ms for binaural and monaural stimulation and, at best, 10 ms for stimulation of the skin. The superior temporal acuity of the ears over the skin was again demonstrated by the finding that pairs of auditory pulses separated by less than 30 ms were perceived as more separated in time than pairs of cutaneous stimuli separated by the same time interval. A series of experiments was conducted to measure inhibitory interaction between touch and hearing. When absolute thresholds were measured by a tracking method in which the subject was free to vary his judgment criterion, auditory stimulation by a click was found to increase tactile thresholds for mechanical pulses by as much as 5.0 dB. Intense tactile pulses slightly increased the auditory click threshold. Subsequent experiments using signal-detection methodology revealed that auditory-tactile masking is caused by a slight reduction in stimulus detectability accompanied by a corresponding increase in the subject's criterion."
"The responses of individual neurons in the cerebral cortex of unanesthetized macaques to moving cutaneous stimuli are described. In somatic sensory area I, 70 percent of the neurons studied exhibit a directional polarization to stimuli moving in opposite direction. In somatic sensory area II, the magnitude of responses is determined by more complex concatenations of stimulus properties, as regards direction of stimulus motion and site of stimulus application on the body."
"In the classical theory of cutaneous sensation, detailed discrimination depends on impulses conducted to cortex over the newly evolved dorsal columns. This idea is no longer tenable because, when this system is destroyed, animals can still discriminate weight, texture, vibration, two points, and position. If all parallel ascending systems are destroyed except for the dorsal columns, the dorsal colunms alone are unable to initiate any behavior. Positive results of dorsal column section are all related to movement: failure of orientation; failure to handle objects in extrapersonal space; and the presence of immobility, especially in the absence of vision. In an attempt to explain these results, it is proposed that dorsal column impulses do not lead to sensation, but act to initiate and control an internal search of messages arriving over other pathways. When this search fails to provide adequate information for identification of the stimulus, an external search or exploration begins, and it is proposed that dorsal columns are necessary for this search too. In these proposals, the new system sets the program on which the older systems operate so that the new system is only essential for sensation when program change and manipulation is essential in the older pathways."
"In an attempt to gain more knowledge about the human reading process, some experiments were performed using a computer-controlled array of 144 neon lights to simulate a \"moving belt\" of English text. Subjects were asked to read aloud as the width of the display and horizontal resolution over the display were varied. For the variable-width high-resolution conditions, excellent comprehension was obtained if each point of the moving patterns was visible for at least 150 ms while traveling across the aperture of the display. This 150-ms display-time requirement means that, for a high level of comprehension, reading rate is proportional to the width of the display aperture until the maximum reading speed of the subject is reached. If the subjects are reading over 50 words per minute, the variable resolution results indicate that greater reading speed can be obtained by distributing the same number of neon lights over a wider field of view. Reading with analogous tactile arrays by blind subjects was compared with these visual results and showed good agreement. A simple model of the human reading process consistent with these results is presented and discussed. These results have direct bearing on the design of displays with optimum information-transfer capabilities."
"The initial evaluation of a system for converting an optical image into a tactile display is reported. A 400-tactor array has proved capable of providing blind and sighted subjects with useful information about the disposition of objects in three dimensions. External localization of percepts was greatly facilitated by giving observers control of the sensing and imaging device, a television camera. There has been a surprising similarity between the blind and sighted observers in their manner and speed of gaining facility with the system. The system's limitations thus far appear to be due more to the low resolution of the display than to the skin's shortcomings as a receptor surface."
"This paper describes two optical-to-tactile imageconversion systems being developed for the blind. The first is a reading aid in which an area on the printed page about the size of a letterspace is translated into a corresponding vibratory tactile image. The tactile image is produced by a 24-by-6 array of pins driven by piezoelectric bimorphs. The array of 144 pins fits on the distal and a portion of the middle phalanges of one finger. The piezoelectric bimorphs cause the pins to impact the skin in a nonlinear manner. Precise measurements on this bimorph-finger system are given. These measurements also show that shades of \"grey\" can be displayed by sequentially varying the threshold level. Three experiments conducted with the reading aid involved measurement of legibility, reading rate, and the effect of field of view. Legibility in the 92-98 percent range was obtained at the design magnification. A reading rate of 50 words per minute was achieved with one subject after roughly 160 hours of practice. Three other subjects achieved reading rates of over 10 words per minute after about 40 hours of practice. Reading rate increased markedly as the number of columns in the array was varied from one to six. The second optical-to-tactile image-conversion system is merely an extension of the first to permit information to be acquired from the environment. In fact, ultimately only one system with two sets of optics, one appropriate for the printed page and one appropriate for environment sensing, would be used."
"The feasibility of communicating pictorial information through the skin has been demonstrated. A tactile television system has permitted blind subjects to determine the position, size, shape, and orientation of visible objects and to track moving targets. The system comprises 1) a vidicon camera utilizing a zoom lens, 2) a digital switching matrix to sequentially connect each element of the photocathode surface through a single video amplifier and signal conditioner to each of the 3) 400 tactile stimulators in a 20 × 20 matrix in contact with a 10-inch square of skin. This image-projector matrix impresses on the skin a two-dimensional vibrating facsimile of either the silhouette or the outline of a visible object. The single-channel swept system exhibits inherent economies when a great number of picture elements is to be processed. Since the fovea of the human eye subserving the central two degrees of detailed vision is comprised of cone cells in a matrix about 200 receptors across, the present 20-line system permits picture transmission with a linear resolution about one-tenth that of the fovea, and has proved adequate for the recognition of human faces. Calculations indicate that the input capacity of the skin of the trunk should compare favorably with that of the fovea. We have determined the electrical-stimulus parameters for painless stimulation of the sensation of mechanical vibration with small electrodes in a closely spaced matrix."
"An explorable electrotactile display has been constructed and tested. A thus far neglected sensation was identified and has been shown to be more useful than the more common electrotactile sensations. Exploration of the surface of the electrotactile display elicits a sensation describable as texture. Experiments have indicated that the intensity of this texture sensation is due primarily to the peak applied voltage rather than to current density as is the case for the classical electrotactile sensation. For subjects employing the texture sensation, experimental results are given for approximate thresholds and for the effect of electrode area on these thresholds. A boundary-localization measurement is offered as a measure of the usefulness of the display for textured-area presentation, and form-separation measurements are given as a measure of usefulness for line-drawing presentations. A proposed model for the mechanism producing the texture sensation is offered as a guide for future experimentation and display-engineering development."
"The possibility that the mechanical characteristics of skin and tissues may influence physiological and psychophysical measurements of tactile sensitivity is considered. A survey of selected literature indicating how certain mechanical characteristics of skin and tissue vary as a function of changes in variables known to influence physiological and psychophysical measurements of the tactile system is presented. Finally, certain physiological and psychophysical studies in which the physical properties of the area stimulated may have influenced the results are mentioned."
"A sensory-aids display system that transmits information to its user through the location of a vibratory sensation on the skin has been developed. The sensation location is controlled by use of the phantom-sensation phenomenon. The development of the display included the determination of sensory and mechanical characteristics of the skin. The system was evaluated as a kinesthetic feedback display from the elbow prostheses for above-elbow amputees."
"A display consisting of two vibrators attached to the body was tested using three different error signal-to-vibration amplitude transformations. In addition, a novel ripple display consisting of seven sequentially activated air-jet stimulators was tested on a compensatory tracking task. For both displays the range of gains and body locations were determined by both describing-function and error-power analyses. The results showed that the two-vibrator display was equally effective on all five body areas tested, but that the ripple display produced best tracking performance only when widely spaced or situated on an anatomical landmark. The best ripple display, however, was better than the best vibrator display and provided tracking performance nearly equivalent to visual displays. It was found that the ripple display was not enhanced by apparent motion but produced equivalent operator time delays shorter than those measured with visual displays."
 "The instrumentation produced and the results obtained with the tactile vision-substitution system (TVSS) developed in our laboratories have been described by Collins [1] and White [2]. With the TVSS, the information from a TV camera is carried to the brain by means of the tactile receptors in the skin of the back and their neural pathways. Such information produces subjective impressions in blind subjects that are analogous to the subjective impressions produced by the visual input in normal sighted people. Some of the neural mechanisms underlying the systems design and the results obtained with the TVSS are noted."
"The contribution of a novel cutaneous display of elbow angle to an amputee's ability to position an EMG-controlled externally powered elbow prosthesis was objectively evaluated. Comparisons were made between the amputee's positional control of his conventional mechanical cable-operated elbow and the EMG \"Boston Arm\"l elbow, with and without angle feedback, in REACHING tasks with vision occluded in all cases and with and without auditory occlusion. MATCHING tasks compared his ability to position the EMG limb to conform with the flexion of his normal (contralateral) elbow. Computer reduction of almost 9000 individual trials and analysis of variance indicated that for the EMG limb the tactile feedback with sound occluded reduced errors by 50 percent. Terminal device load did not significantly affect positioningperformance due to the force proprioception built into the Boston Arm. In comparison with the standard mechanical prosthesis, the EMG limb with feedback achieves virtually identical kinesthetic performance. The display is completely compatible with the EMG control, causes no discomfort to the wearer, and is not significantly degraded by the environmental conditions of the limb socket."
"Experiments were performed to establish the relation between scales of perceived intensity and primary cortical potentials obtained under identical stimulation conditions. When the maximal positive-negative deflection of the primary component of the averaged evoked potential was plotted against stimulus displacement, all data were well represented by power functions with exponents of nearly the same size as those of the psychophysical functions. The results indicate also that spatial summation takes place when two neighboring locations are stimulated with an increase in apparent intensity of only about √2 of that corresponding to monodigital stimulation."

"Tests consisting of one- and two-axis closed-loop tracking tasks, with and without motion, have been made to define some areas where motion cues are beneficial. Tests were made with reduced scaling on the motion input to investigate the minimum requirements of motion cues in those tests where motion was found to be of assistance. For the set of conditions tested, little or no difference in the measurement criteria was observed in the single-axis motion/no motion runs. Similar results were obtained when comparing two single-axis tests with different pitch orientation. The two-axis tests, which consisted of pitch and yaw and pitch and roll, did, however, produce a difference in the error measurements in the motion/no motion comparison. A decrease in normalized tracking error and an increase in closed-loop system frequency were observed when motion was added. Tests were also run, in pitch and yaw only, in which the scale of the motion input was reduced. These tests were performed by the subject in sequence starting with no motion all the way to full motion and back down to no motion. Each motion scale condition (none, 1/16, ⅛, ¼, ½, and full) constituted a test. The normalized tracking error remained constant for full, ½, and ¼ motion scaling, but increased with a further reduction in motion scaling."
"Quantitative models of human motion are developed relating reaction time, movement time, and manipulation time to stimulus, movement, and manipulation information. Response surface methodology, a statistical design and modeling technique, was used. Linear models relating time to information seem appropriate, and no significant interactions were uncovered."
"Electronic displays pose large human-engineering possibilities and, at the same time, new problems. One special aspect is the rotation of the display reference system. The human operator is unable to compensate for rotation. This is why tracking errors increase considerably at 90 and 270° rotation angles. Related experiments are described in detail. A new \"action display\" indicating the stick signal to the control system compensates completely for the rotation effect."
"The results of an experiment to evaluate several cursor forms for use on alphanumeric CRT displays are presented. Cursor form and cursor blink rate were investigated in terms of their effects on operator search time in finding the cursor in a random location and their effects on tracking the cursor as it is moved between fixed random locations. Six cursor forms at five alternation rates were examined. The cursor forms were box, underline, cross, diamond, blinking, and wiggling cursors. Alternation rates were 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6 Hz. Based on results and additional criteria about the use of cathode-ray-tube displays, it was determined that, of the cursors examined, a box cursor around each graphic character blinking at 3 Hz is most effectively searched and tracked. Subjective evaluations support this finding."

"Richard L. Deininger passed away suddenly on March 30, 1970, at the age of 42. In his combination of engineering and psychological training and in his ability to understand and apply himself to man-machine problems, Dick typified the effective human-factors engineer. His publications made major contributions to the design of computer retrieval systems and pushbutton keyboards. He supervised a group working on telephone design problems both in the laboratory and in the field at Bell Telephone Laboratories. He served as Chairman of the Man-Machine Systems Group of IEEE. He was a fellow of the Division of Engineering Psychologists of the American Psychological Association, American Statistical Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science."
"A study has been conducted to determine the effects of several variations of two types of visual display systems on subjective pilot evaluations and objective measures of performance in the landing approach. Two types of flight approaches were made with either a projector or collimatmoed nitor visual display: 1) the instrument approach, and 2) the visual approach without the nonmal cockpit instrumentation assistance. The variables examined were color, differences between displays due to collimation, and reduced resolution. The use of color had two main effects on pilot performance in the landing approach. The touchdown distance and standard deviations increased more for the monitor displays, and the touchdown rates of descent were slightly lower. With collimation, the standard deviations of touchdown distance increased, and the rate-of-descent standard deviations decreased in a direction more favorable with the actual flight data. The time outside the glide-slope error limits was less with the monitor display, and the lateral localizer error was smaller for the projector display, because the pilots intercepted the runway center line at a greater distance from the threshold. With reduced resolution, there was a slight change in the touchdown distance and the standard deviation; for the flights made without color, the landings were predominantly to the right of the runway center line with twice the standard deviation. The pilots were more critical of the black and white variation for either display, and favored more use of a color system."
"The functional variation of perception time T in car following is studied for the purpose of introducing a variable time delay into a previously proposed nonlinear model. The basic hypothesis is that the ratio of a just noticeable difference in visual angle (Δθ) to the visual angle (θ) is a constant. This hypothesis leads to a model in which perception time T is proportional to relative spacing and inversely proportional to relative speed. Experimental results agree very closely with the model for negative relative speeds between 3 and 18 ft/s. A second-order approximation is used to explain behavior for relative speeds of less than 3 ft/s in absolute value. This second-order approximation also agrees well with data taken previously with relative acceleration varying between 1 and 4.7 ft/s2 and initial relative speed between - 1.9 and 2.9 ft/s. A brief discussion of \"ideal\" following distance b is presented to clarify the stability analysis. The introduction of a variable time delay and ideal following distance into the proposed car-following model changes the size of the minimum asymptotic stability region but not the basic properties of the model. The word \"asymptotic\" is used in the dynamic stability sense as in the classical control theory literature, not in the sense of platoon stability."
"A proposed man-machine system for encoding fingerprint ridge characteristics is described. The fundamental concept underlying the proposed system is to use an operator to recognize the ridge characteristics and to impart to a computer the ability to manipulate and compare the digitized locations and directions of these characteristics for single-fingerprint classification. The proposed system and encoding schemes were simulated using a RAND tablet and an IBM 1800 computer. Sample input prints were encoded and stored on a magnetic tape. Experimental results on human factors and multiple-impression file searches illustrate the feasibility of computer-assisted fingerprint encoding and classification."
"An auditory, distractive stressor was developed that automatically adjusts its rate of presenting random digits to human subjects. The rate of digit presentation serves as an inverse index of the amount of attention the subject can spare from a primary task, such as driving a simulated car. The auditory pattern recognition of the device was evaluated under several speaking conditions and for a variety of human speakers. The distractive stressor has a satisfactory digit recognition accuracy, and consequently adapts its digit presentation rate quickly according to how well a subject repeats its given numbers."

 "This paper describes a problem-oriented programming system in which students can construct models of physical systems. The \"bond-graph\" notation is used for representing physical and engineering components and their interconnections, whether as a general and descriptive model or a specific and quantitative one. Using a simple linear notation the student enters the model into the computer via a standard keyboard and observes the behavior simulated by the ENPORT program. The results are given in function values and simple curves that reveal certain well known but instructional aspects of physics. A description is given of an instructional monitor that is capable of evaluating the student's model by comparing it to a \"reference\" model constructed by a teacher. The problem of interpreting differences between bond graphs in a way that aids student learning was not solved, but the student is given full access to ENPORT to bypass the problems of effective monitoring."
"An instructional monitor is a program that tries to detect, diagnose, and possibly help overcome a student's learning difficulties in the course of solving a problem or performing a task. In one approach to building an instructional monitor, the student uses a special task- or problem-oriented language expressly designed around some particular class of problems. Correspondingly, the diagnostic programs in this special-purpose type of monitor system often utilize information that is specific to the kind of problem being studied. The SIMON system represents a different approach. The student addresses SIMON in an easy and very general programming language rather than a special task language. Using SIMON, students construct programs for systems or processes that can represent vastly different situations from mathematics, biology, physics, engineering, or elsewhere. The student tests his program against a \"true\" program provided to SIMON by an instructor. At the student's request, SIMON tests his program against its \"true\" model to determine if it works. If not, SIMON points out cases where the program fails and, if requested, informs the student which variables he has chosen that are inappropriate to the process."
"An environment is described in which a computer dynamically generates simple instructional and remedial sequences for nonnumeric topics such as geography and biology. This environment is described in detail and consists of a structured pool of information and sets of mechanisms (skeleton patterns) that extract data from the pool. The environment is implemented in the form of an interactive ALGOL program on the Burroughs B5500, and examples of interactions with students are included."
"The main purpose of the research reported here is to show that a new and more powerful type of computer-assisted instruction (CAI), based on extensive application of artificial-intelligence (AI) techniques, is feasible, and to demonstrate some of its major capabilities. A set of computer programs was written and given the name SCHOLAR. Due to its complexity, only the conception and educational aspects of this system (including an actual on-line protocol) are presented in this paper. In what may be called conventional ad hoc-frame-oriented (AFO) CAI, the data base consists of many \"frames\" of specific pieces of text, questions, and anticipated answers entered in advance by the teacher. By contrast, an information-structure-oriented (ISO) CAI system is based on the utilization of an information network of facts, concepts, and procedures; it can generate text, questions, and corresponding answers. Because an ISO CAI system can also utilize its information network to answer questions formulated by the student, a mixed-initiative dialogue between student and computer is possible with questions and answers from both sides."
"The derivation of phonetic transcription is one component of speech processing that can utilize man-data techniques. This involves the assignment and time location of phonetic symbols to speech data. Conventional transcription methods are suspect in at least two respects. First, the symbols assigned are often based on \"talker intention,\" or what \"should be,\" rather than on physical evidence; and, second, symbol location is usually related to subsequent machine processing only minimally. An exploratory procedure is described that operates on-line, in an interactive mode, utilizing a graphic display with an IBM System/360 model 40. Available for display are a digital sound spectrogram, the power spectrum at a given time sample, an average spectrum for a given sound class, and correlations of a current spectrum with average spectra. Using this technique, location and assignment of phonetic symbols are less dependent upon operator expertise (and/or bias) and highly related to subsequent processing."
"A new method is proposed that can identify a linear system with a random input signal in a short time for application to the identification of manual tracking systems whose response characteristics vary slowly with time. Making use of this method of identification, a display system including an on-line computer is constructed, which displays the slowly varying response characteristics of manual tracking systems on a CRT screen in real time. A software system that facilitates performance of various kinds of tracking experiments is developed. Finally, some results of simple pursuit tracking experiments are described and the mode of the tracking operation is discussed."

 "Some significant ways are discussed for describing or identifying systems and systems concepts so that less information is needed to understand them and this information can be communicated more quickly. The three major categories, structure, names of distinguishing qualities, and magnitude, probability, and time, identify the similarities and differences between various systems. Emphasis is put on the possibility that parts of these various systems may be sufficiently similar for detailed and authentic work on one system to be of value for another system. With the advent of large multiprocessing computers, such characteristics may result in more efficient use of hardware and software."
"The linear least-mean-square error (LMS) estimate of a scalar random variable given an observation of a vector-valued random variable (data) is well know. Computation of the estimate requires knowledge of the data correlation matrix. Algorithms have been proposed by Griffiths [9] and by Widrow [7] for iterative determination of the estimate of each element from a sequence of scalar random variables given an observation of the corresponding element from a sequence of date vectors when the data correlation matrix is not known. These algorithms are easy to implement, require little storage, and are suitable for real-time processing. Past convergence studies of these algorithms have assumed that the data vectors were mutually independent. In this study some asymptotic properties of these and other related algorithms are derived for a sequence of mutually correlated data vectors. A generalized algorithm is defined for analytic purposes. It is demonstrated for this generalized algorithm that excess mean-square error (as defined by Widrow) can be made arbitrarily small for large values of time in the correlated case. The analysis can be applied to a particular estimation scheme of 1) the particular algorithm can be placed in the generalized form, and 2) the given assumptions are satisfied. The analysis of the generalized algorithm requires that the data vectors possess only a few properties; foremost among these are ergodicity and a form of asymptotic independence. This analysis does not assume any particular probability distribution function nor any particular form of mutual correlation for the data vectors."
"The selection of a \"best\" subset of features from a given set is considered for the case where a multiplicity of constraints are present in the two-class pattern recognition problem. The problem can be formulated with a Lagrangian multiplier and an efficient iterative technique used in conjunction with dynamic programming procedures to obtain a solution when two constraints are present. The problem can be formulated in integer programming terms and use made of available integer programming computer algorithms for solution when multiple constraints are present. The Lemke-Spielberg zero-one integer algorithm is particularly useful, but other integer programming algorithms can be used also."
"If the transient response of the error between the input and the output of a given nonlinear system is known to be asymptotically stable, and if it is desired that this response should follow some model response, the proposed method can be used to compute the optimum values of the adjustable parameters of this system. For using this method, the solution of the nonlinear differential equation governing the system need not be known. The method does not require the incorporation of a physical model for generation of the model response. In some cases, it is not required to know the nonlinearity in explicit analytical form but just the graphical form is enough. The method is applicable to time-invariant noiseless continuous systems subjected to deterministic inputs. Application of the method is illustrated by working out examples. Analog computer plots of the model and optimum responses are presented in every case."
"The problem of feature selection in pattern recognition is briefly reviewed. Feature selection techniques discussed include 1) information theoretic approach, 2) direct estimation of error probability, 3) feature-space transformation, and 4) approach of using stochastic automata model. These techniques are applied to the selection of features in the crop classification problem. Computer similation results are presented and compared."
"The synthesis of sequential discrete systems involves two major steps: 1) the abstract synthesis that yields a state-transition diagram, and 2) the structure synthesis that yields a realization. The structure synthesis, where the minimum state-transition diagram is assumed to be given, is discussed. Classically, two different models are in use to perform the structure synthesis: the finite-state model with memory span k=1, and the finitememory model. These classical models (the finite-state model extended for k≥1), are considered and other models are introduced that may be used for the structure synthesis. The latter, combined models with memory span k (k≥1), sometimes yield a better realization (according to specific engineering requirements) than the classical models. Structure synthesis based on the combined models and a rough evaluation of all the considered models from the standpoint of their realization is included in this paper together with an outline of a FORTRAN IV program being developed to automate the complete structure synthesis."
"A method is described for the solution of both linear and nonlinear optimization problems with inequality constraints. Use of the suggested method permits the point of conditional absolute minimum to be found directly when the objective function has a single minimum and when the constraints generate a feasible design region. The method is based on simple repetitive calculations and is, therefore, especially suitable for use with a digital computer. Beacuse of the procedure of the calculation process, the method is called the \"direct search along active constraints.\""
"A linear classifier based on linear programming which is adaptive to a change in the set of input vectors is discussed. Different from other linear classifiers, this one maintains the maximum reliability of its operation, provided that the set of pattern vectors is linearly separable. A procedure of deriving an optimum structure of the linear classifier for a change in the set of input vectors is a modification of the ordinary simplex method and yields an optimum structure in much fewer iterations than the straightforward application of the ordinary simplex method does. The adaptive procedure is then extended to the case in which a linear classifier maintains the minimum number of erroneously classified input vectors even if the set of input pattern vectors is not linearly separable. This is based on Gomory's algorithm for integer linear programming. The feasibility and efficiency of these linear classifiers are computationally proved by some examples."
"Differential equations are developed for the smoothing density function and for the smoothed expectation of an arbitrary function of the state. The exact equations developed herein are difficult to solve except in trivially simple cases. Approximations to these equations are developed for the smoothed expectation of the state and the smoothing covariance matrix. For linear systems these equations are shown to reduce to previously derived results. An iterative technique is suggested for even greater accuracy in approximations for severely nonlinear systems."

 "Automation of the radar target detection process for remotely located scanning radars in an air traffic control system results in a queueing requirement for target reports when the communication link transfer rate is less than that of the radar. To determine the nature of this queueing requirement, a systems model was developed which incorporates the effects of aircraft target spacing at random intervals, in flight corridors, and in close formation clusters. The entire system was simulated to determine the queueing statistics as a function of the target spacing parameters, the load, the total number of targets, and the mixture of different message lengths. Verification of the simulation for one case which used a simplified target location model with all targets randomly located was obtained by mathematical analysis. A comparison of the two types of target location models showed that the complex target location model created a queue whose mean and variance were significantly larger than that created by the simplified model with all targets randomly located."
"An approach to the input-output stability of feedback systems is discussed. This approach incorporates the natural inverse operator model to describe these systems. Using this operator, the input-output stability problem is decomposed into five subproblems. One of these subproblems involves the causality of the input-output operator, a property not recognized in previous feedback system stability studies. Following the development of the model and the stability definition some general stability theorems are presented."
"A linear reinforcement learning technique is proposed to provide a memory and thus accelerate the convergence of successive approximation algorithms. The learning scheme is used to update weighting coefficients applied to the components of the correction terms of the algorithm. A direction of the search approaching the direction of a \"ridge\" will result in a gradient peak-seeking method which accelerates considerably the convergence to a neighborhood of the extremum. In a stochastic approximation algorithm the learning scheme provides the required memory to establish a consistent direction or search insensitive to perturbations introduced by the random variables involved. The accelerated algorithms and the respective proofs of convergence are presented. Illustrative examples demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithms."
"Visual target tracking during active head movements is investigated. Transient response and frequency response both indicate that the eye tracking behavior relative to the target is independent of head movement. The explanation of this phenomenon is pursued. It seems most likely that the vestibulo-ocular reflex, the eye movements elicited by head rotation, plays an essential role. Compensation for head motion is accomplished by this reflex at relatively high frequencies, making visual fixation on stationary objects quite easy. The dynamics of head motion are also investigated. Unusual nonlinear responses are found at high frequencies. Namely, the response frequency is slightly lower than that of the target. A model of the whole system is proposed."
"A suboptimum method of extracting features, by linear operations, from continuous data belonging to M pattern classes is presented. The set of features selected minimizes bounds on the probability of error obtained from the Bhattacharyya distance and the Hajek divergence. The random processes associated with the pattern classes are assumed to be Gaussian with different means and covariance functions. For M=2, in the two special cases in which, respectively, the means and the covariance functions are the same, both the above distance measures yield the same answer. The results obtained represent an extension of the existing results for two pattern classes with the same means and different covariance functions."
"The postural control system in normal humans is studied by applying a mechanical torque disturbance to the system. It is shown that the response of the system can be approximated by a second-order differential equation where the parameters depend on the state of the system."
"The postural control system in normal humans is studied by applying a tendon jerk disturbance to the system. A stretch reflex was elicited in the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle by a tap on the achilles tendon. It is shown that the initial conditions (muscle tension or the length of the muscle) and the stimulus (strength of the hammer force) have strong influence on the reflex response (change in foot torque or angle)."
"A linear lumped-parameter mechanical model of the muscle spindle is presented. It is shown that the model simulation on a digital computer exhibits the spindle behavior in most aspects of transient ramp-stretch performance. The requirements that such a model places on the mechanisms of fusimotor control are discussed."
"Improved mathematical optimization procedures are steadily finding wider use in engineering system studies, but the difficulties associated with the solution of discrete decision variable models remain formidable. An algorithm is described which will solve a certain class of problems formulated as linear integer programs. The procedure employs parallel shifts of selected boundary planes. This is accomplished by incrementing the appropriate slack variables which are constrained to be integers when the restraint conditions are formulated as diophantine equations. A hierarchy of variables is established to direct the boundary shifts. Feasibility and sensitivity tests truncate the search."
"A procedure is presented for specifying how long a supervisor or monitor of a process should wait between input samples to maximize a given value or payoff function, assuming he resets the controls with each sample as a function of the best information he has. The procedure is based upon Bayesian preposterior information analysis."
"The template-layout problem is to determine how to cut irregular-shaped two-dimensional pieces out of given stock sheets in an optimum manner without making an exhaustive search of all possible arrangements of the pieces. An algorithm is described for solving template-layout problems with a digital computer. The method of solution requires that the irregular shapes be enclosed, singly or in combination, in minimum area rectangles called modules. Individual modules will contain from one to perhaps eight optimally fitted irregular pieces. The modules are then packed into the given stock sheet(s) so as to optimize a specified objective function. The packing is carried out with a dynamic programming algorithm, which converts the multivariable problem into a multistage one. Successive iterations of the algorithm are used to determine whether higher order modules (containing more irregular-shaped pieces) improve the solution. A detailed description of the algorithm is given. An illustrative example is included and its computer solution is described. The paper concludes with an extension of the algorithm to an improved version which can be expected to yield solutions more closely approaching the true optimum."
"In unsupervised learning pattern recognition problems, the need arises for updating conditional density functions of uncertain parameters using probability density function mixtures. In general, the form of the density mixtures is not reproducing, invoking the need for unlimited system storage requirements. One suboptimal method for achieving limited storage is to restrict the uncertain parameters in question to come from finite sets of values. An alternate method is proposed for a class of problems and its performance is shown to converge to that of the optimum unlimited storage system. A generalization of the procedure is also discussed."
"An optical character recognition system for handprinted numerals of noisy and low-resolution measurement is proposed. The system consists of the two-stage feature extraction process. In the first stage a set of primary features insensitive to the quality and format of a black-white bit pattern are extracted. In the second stage, a set of properties capable of discriminating the character classes is derived from primary features. The system is simple and reliable in that only three kinds of primary features are needed to be detected. The recognition is based on the decision tree which tests the logic statements of secondary features."
"A recent application of many of the principles established in [1]-[3] is presented. Although the fundamental motivation of the theory is to analyze constraint in mathematical models of very high dimension, it is hoped that this ten-dimensional example will clarify the techniques and provide a focus for the utility of the constraint concept."

 "A model has been developed to simulate an urban short takeoff and landing (STOL) system. It was designed as a tool for the evaluation of flight hardware and also to provide insight into the specialized nature of an urban transportation system such as the one envisioned for the Northeast Corridor. The actions of aircraft are treated in the high level of detail characteristic of an urban shuttle system with its constraints and limitations. Considerations included: 1) variable passenger demands, 2) dispatching decisions, 3) takeoff and airspace regulations, 4) variations in interfering aircraft traffic, and 5) off-corridor services. The implementation allows for simulation and analysis of aircraft and passenger movements and the consequent interactions. Output is generated in terms of the realistic and useful figures of cost, revenue, and systems performance needed to evaluate each phase of the STOL operation. The model was written in the general purpose simulation system language."
"A sequential method of pattern recognition was used to recognize hyperthyroidism in a sample of 2208 patients being treated at the Straub Clinic in Honolulu, Hawaii. For this, the method of class featuring information compression (CLAFIC) [1] was used, introducing some significant improvements in computer medical diagnosis, which by its very nature is a pattern recognition problem. A unique subspace characterizes each class at every decision stage, and the most prominent class features are selected. Thus the symptoms which best distinguish hyperthyroidism are extracted at every step and the number of tests required to reach a diagnosis is reduced."
"An observation comes from one of two possible classes. If all the statistics of the problem are known, Bayes' classification scheme yields the minimum probability of error. If, instead, the statistics are not known and one is given only a labeled training set, it is known that the nearest neighbor rule has an asymptotic error no greater than twice that of Bayes' rule. Here the (k,k') nearest neighbor rule with a reject option is examined. This rule looks at the k nearest neighbors and rejects if less than k' of these are from the same class; if k' or more are from one class, a decision is made in favor of that class. The error rate of such a rule is bounded in terms of the Bayes' error rate."
"A self-organizing procedure to achieve a performance adaptive controller with asymptotically optimal properties is proposed for systems with completely or partially unknown dynamics. A physically realizable controller that operates in an unknown stochastic environment is obtained. The accrued cost during a global random search for the minimum converges to the minimum value corresponding to the specific optimal controller. The global search strategy includes a subgoal defined on a nondecreasing time subinterval and an algorithm of adaptive random type. The stochastic fuel regulator problem with random switching delay is used as an application of the method and simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness."
"A nonlinear class of models for biological and physical processes is surveyed. It is shown that these so-called bilinear systems have a variable dynamical structure that makes them quite controllable. While control systems are classically designed so there are no unstable modes, bilinear systems may utilize appropriately controlled unstable modes of response to enhance controllability."
"Dynostat is the name given to a system optimization technique employing both instantaneous and predictive optimum seeking strategies in parallel. Although it has both off-line and on-line capabilities of application this account is concerned mainly with an explanation of the essentials of the technique in the context of off-line optimization studies. A brief description of a successful application study of a practical problem in industry is also included. The technique is explained in a progressive manner by considering an example for which there is a requirement for an optimum schedule of alternative energy sources. As is well known, optimum scheduling using the dynamic programming technique is restricted in practice by limitations in computer storage and computing time to systems with few independent variables. However, in certain classes of multichannel systems some of these variables appear naturally, or by reasonable approximation can be made to appear, in a static section of the system, and it is shown that optimizing their values need consume only little computer time and storage. The remainder of the variables are in the dynamic section and their optimization makes a heavy demand on computational facilities. The Dynostat technique handles both types of variables in a single computer algorithm. An indication of a projected on-line configuration of Dynostat is presented in a statement of developments of the technique currently under study."
"A probabilistic automaton with pattern recognition supervision is considered as an on-line real-time adaptive controller for a complex plant with a multimodal performance-index structure and subjected to an environment which randomly fluctuates in time. This environment is considered to be partially measurable but entirely uncontrollable. The automaton discussed is capable not only of learning the optimum control parameters in any given environmental situation but also of acting as an internal teacher in the formation of pattern associations between the measurable state of the environment and the control situation, so that approximately recurrent conditions can be taken advantage of in future relearning situations. These pattern associations, once developed, are used to supervise the future action of the automaton. Furthermore, the pattern associations between the measurable state of the environment and the control situation must themselves be adaptively formed to allow for variations caused by unknown and/or unmeasurable factors in the total environment."
"A survey of university programs in systems engineering is presented. Only institutions having formally organized programs leading to degrees or options in systems engineering, systems science, cybernetics, or related fields are included. A list of institutions includes a statement of the history and position of the program at the institution. Eighteen categories of subject matter offered in these programs are proposed and the classification of typical course titles into the categories is exemplified. A subject matter profile is established for each program by reporting the number of courses that fall within each of the eighteen categories."
"The sum-line algorithm (SLA) for use with an adaptive linear threshold element is shown experimentally to have excellent extrapolative properties when applied to two-class multivariate Gaussian pattern-classification problems, even when the number of sample patterns is severely limited. The algorithm iteratively adapts the desired analog-output sum of the threshold element while simultaneously adapting the weights of the element. The algorithm converges toward a solution weight vector. It is shown experimentally that this vector tends toward the solution provided by the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm or that provided by the matched-filter (MF) algorithm, whichever is best able to extrapolate from a given set of sample patterns to patterns that are derived from the same statistical populations but are not included in the sample set."
 "The Davidon method as extended by Tripathi and Narendra [1], [2] is applied to optimal control problems with terminal state constraints adjoined to the cost functional as penalty functions. The results of two numerical examples indicate that this algorithm provides an attractive alternative to conjugate gradient algorithms."
"A person may give his attention directly by transporting himself from place to place, or vicariously by communicating over a wire with the object of his attention. A procedure is presented for combined allocation of these two kinds of personal presence. Allocation of a physician's time to direct diagnosis versus telediagnosis is an example."
"This noniterative method for approximating empirical signals over [O,∞ ) by a linear combination of exponentials yields suboptimal approximation. Notably, the dependence of the suboptimal exponents λi' on the fractional integral square error ε is such that limε⟶0 λi = λi, the optimal exponents. The integral square error in representation is studied for a sin and a square pulse, and a useful error formula is developed."

 "New ways are becoming available for analyzing our social systems. These permit the design of revised policies to improve the behavior of the systems within which we live. Industrial dynamics relates system structure to behavior. Industrial dynamics belongs to the same general subject area as feedback systems, servomechanisms theory, and cybernetics. Industrial dynamics is the study of how the feedback loop structure of a system produces the dynamic behavior of that system. In managerial terms industrial dynamics makes possible the structuring of the components and policies of a system to show how the resulting dynamic behavior is produced. In terms of social systems it deals with the forces that arise within a system to cause changes through time. The structure of an urban area has been organized into a system model to show the life cycle dynamics of urban growth and decay. The results suggest that most of today's popular urban policies lie between neutral and detrimental in their effectiveness. Quite different policies are suggested when one comes to an understanding of why urban areas evolve as they do. The city shows the general characteristics of a complex system."
"The purpose is to illustrate the applicability of the approach and the techniques of systems engineering to certain urban problems. Systems engineering can be an effective tool in the design and operation of organizations to accomplish such urban activities as police scheduling, waste disposal, river purification, fire house location, etc. The relatively unploughed ground of applying systems engineering to the quality of urban life is addressed here. The quality of urban life, an elusive but intuitively satisfying concept, is operationally useful to the extent that a city can identify and move toward achieving the goals of its citizenry. Social indicators measure the extent to which these goals have been achieved. For such indicators to be usable on line inputs for determining changes in urban subsystems, they must respond rapidly and sensitively to the citizenry's changing perception of the gap between goals and actual achievements. Indicators aggregated over long intervals of time, large physical areas, or population groups tend to be sluggish and historical. It is shown how unsolicited complaints and comments from the citizenry may help to define such operationally useful social indicators. A conceptual framework emphasizing adaptive urban subsystems is presented, and data are used to illustrate the feasibility of the approach."
"The purpose of the model presented is to maximize the social profitability of a governmental agency by determining prices and production levels of two different sources of water. This maximization is performed subject to both sociopolitical and physical constraints. The nonlinear stochastic model developed is reduced to a linear stochastic model of one decision variable. Also presented are the results of the application of the model to an existing situation."
"An analytical approach to several operational problems of urban police departments is introduced. In particular, the focus is on urban police patrol forces and the two important activities of a patrol car (or patrol unit) 1) answering a call for police service, 2) performing crime preventive patrol. After reviewing the traditional allocation method, a patrol travel time model and a preventive patrol model are developed. The first depicts the time required for a patrol unit to travel from its position at time of dispatch until arrival at the scene of the incident. The second relates the frequency of patrols to physical parameters and can be used to estimate the probability that a patrolling unit will intercept a crime while in progress. Applications of the models are discussed."
"A simulation model designed to compare different policies for locating, relocating, and dispatching fire-fighting units is described. Issues treated include: the use of internal measures of performance as proxies for global ones; the use of analytical models for various subproblems to yield policies to be tested; the handling of loss of life and other important but rare events. The SIMSCRIPT 1.5 simulator and input and post-simulation analysis programs are described. Results that have been used by the Fire Department of the City of New York are presented and analyzed."
"The high cost of public education has stimulated interest in applying the techniques of operations research and systems analysis to the management of schools. These applications are generally intended to promote greater efficiency in school operations and insure more effective use of educational resources. Due to the sociopolitical nature of public elementary and secondary educational institutions, the role of the operations research (OR) specialist-systems analyst in the education sector might be considered different from his counterpart in the military and industrial sectors. The function of the OR specialist in a large urban school district is particularly affected and influenced by political action groups, both in the school itself, e.g., teacher organizations, and by the community. Yet it is in these large urban districts where problems are most serious and the skills of the OR specialist-systems analyst are in greatest need. An attempt is made to demonstrate the role of the OR specialist in large urban school districts by using a problem situation which concerned itself with the politically sensitive question of developing an alternative to the fixed step salary schedule. A model is developed and analyzed, showing in a scenario fashion the functions of the OR specialist. The highly political nature of certain school district planning problems, such as salary evaluation, strongly suggests that the OR specialist in school districts be highly skilled in working with political action groups and possess communications skills to articulate various aspects of the planning effort, in addition to possessing the usual mathematical competencies."
"Some of the basic elements affecting the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of health programs for the urban poor are developed. The Medicaid program is examined as an example of recent Federal efforts to upgrade the health status of indigent population of the United States. The rapidly rising costs of medical care and the unexpectedly high costs of Medicaid serve to reemphasize the need to carefully evaluate the merits and effectiveness of the Medicaid approach. Variations in state Medicaid plans, nonfiscal problems in coordination and administration, and the inadequacy of available data contribute to lack of effective and continuous program evaluation efforts. With this in mind, requirements for development of an effective management information system for Medicaid are spelled out. Specific examples of the kinds of information needed are given, and some steps taken recently by the federal government to attempt to meet identified needs are highlighted. The role of a management information system for Medicaid is seen in context as a component of a management approach to health programming."
"The results of a total system analysis leading to the optimal design of an automotive exhaust air pollution control device are presented. The purpose is to demonstrate a capability for effectively optimizing design parameters of a subsystem in an operating environment which are subject to three optimality criteria: minimum cost for fixed performance; maximum effectiveness (emission reduction) per total cost dollar; and maximum society benefit per total cost dollar. The cost and performance models of the emission control device are developed. Controlled emissions of a representative vehicle are compared to federal standard levels and extrapolated to the population of vehicles assuming an inspection and maintenance policy. Total emissions are distributed in the air shed, and ground level concentrations are determined. These concentrations are compared with those of an uncontrolled population, and the average benefits of control are determined. The total costs to society of providing maintained control devices are compared to the benefits. Design optimization is performed based on the costs and benefits subject to objective function constraints using a general-purpose optimization language and computer executive SLANG/CUE."
"An approach to water quality control is presented for the case where there could be significant interaction of wastes in a stream. In most previous studies, a single pollutant was considered and a single related water quality parameter was used as a constraint. In highly developed river basins, it is reasonable to expect more than one important pollutant. If they interact in the stream, traditional analysis, which assumes independence, may lead to improper control policies. A free-flowing stream which receives thermal and organic wastes is modeled as an N-stage serial system. Two-dimensional dynamic programming is used to determine minimum-cost control policies. The response of total system cost and control policy to variation of quality standards is presented."
"A procedure for the design of traffic signal control policies which results in minimal average delay and queue length is presented. The procedure is applicable to preset and sampled data controllers. The optimal policy is computed from measurements of the average demand in each flow direction during some interval (10 minutes to several hours). In many cases, substantial improvements over classical techniques in the areas of intersection performance and safety are obtained. In other cases, the theoretical foundations of the new procedure provide proof that the classical design techniques already generate optimal solutions. Computation time for the procedure is sufficiently small to allow a single automaton to control many (100-1000) intersections in real time."
  "A digital simulation of the basic oxygen steel furnace was previously developed, and its output was compared with the available data taken from the literature. The output concentrations were within 10 percent of the literature data, while the simulated temperature was within 0.5 percent. The simulation is used as an off-line model of the process to design an endpoint control system which makes use of the available feedback from the process. Feedback consists of previously existing instrumentation for effluent gas analysis and an instrument designed for quick carbon analysis. The same instrument, independently conceived by Bethlehem Steel, has been proved effective by them. The control system uses Bayesian inference to evaluate process feedback optimally. Equations have been developed and a computational algorithm designed enabling real-time calculation of the probability of a carbon-temperature state given any control action and imperfect measurements. Because the objective function is almost symmetric and the cost of control is minimal compared to the value of an endpoint state, optimal control drives the expected state vector to the center of the tolerance region."
"A theory of visual pattern perception is proposed, which is intended to explain first how patterns are learned or committed to memory, second how these patterns are recognized when subsequently encountered, and third how the patterns are recognized under unfavorable real-world conditions, for example, when they are distorted, enlarged, or rotated, or are viewed along with other patterns in a cluttered and noisy visual field. The essential idea of the theory is that each pattern is represented in memory as a network of memory traces recording the features of the pattern and the attention shifts required to pass from feature to feature across the visual field. These attention shifts may take the form of saccadic eye movements or they may be executed internally, according to the angular displacement involved. Memorizing and recognizing a pattern are thus seen to be closely analogous to memorizing and repeating a conventional sequence of behavior, each being an alternating sequence of sensory and motor activities. From this analogy come certain predictions concerning the presence of scanpaths in eye movements during pattern perception, and one of these predictions has been verified experimentally."
"A method is presented for defining an information measure for deterministic sequences. This is done by considering a sequence as a non-Markovian sample space. The correspondence between redundancy, as defined by this information measure, and measured perception ability is considered."
"A classifier which, in general, implements a nonlinear decision boundary is shown to be equivalent to a linear discriminant function when the measurements are binary valued; its relation to the Bayes classifier is derived. The classifier requires less computation than a similar one based on the Euclidean distance and can perform equally well."

"Correlation between half-hourly atmospheric noise burst levels at 1.6 and 2.9 MHz at Bangalore was examined on a long-term seasonal basis. Good correlation was observed in all cases, and it was found that noise level at one frequency can be predicted from that at another with a standard error of estimate of about 3 dB. Extension of the analysis to the band 100 kHz-5.0 MHz showed that the correlation decreases as the frequency separation increases. Significance of this result for the presentation of noise data is discussed. The problem of the average spectrum of noise is also discussed. It is observed that if the spectrum characteristics are studied for a short period of time (as in the case of local thunderstorms), large variations in the results are to be expected as a matter of statistical fluctuation. Therefore, the problem needs to be studied on a long-term seasonal basis."
"This paper describes a technique for obtaining the induced worst case currents on individual wires of a multiconductor cable as a result of a transient electromagnetic radiation field. The technique involved a development of the expression for the induced current in matrix form where the mutual coupling terms and the other cable currents are the pertinent parameters. A worst case solution results from the assumption of maximum coupling orientation of the individual wires. A short example and some test results are presented. The test results show wave shapes for inductive and capacitive coupling. The solution for the individual wire current due to a transient electromagnetic field is important, since it will greatly reduce the required number of cable measurements and will allow the development of improved shielding techniques."
"This paper describes an analytical technique that may be used to obtain the worst case dipole mode currents on individual wires of a multiconductor cable as a result of a transient electromagnetic radiation field. The dipole mode response is due to the E field parallel to the length of the cable. To obtain the solution, the conductors and their image in the ground plane are considered as forming a loop, and the resultant loop is solved as a transmission mode loop. The solution is given in matrix form as an upper bound of the true current including both mutual inductive and mutual capacitive coupling. The mathematical results are presented in the time domain and are uniquely applicable to experimental results obtained in EMP simulation with narrow pulse driving fields."
"Electromagnetic shielding tests in the 1- to 1O-GHz frequency range have been characterized by lack of repeatability and reliability. New test methods have been developed which correct most of the causes of erratic behavior and have been found to provide reasonably smooth curves when results are plotted against frequency. Study of the results obtained under various conditions of test indicates that the test procedures approach the desired goal of providing a measure of shielding effectiveness that is related only to the test item itself. The cable test procedures are usable with any type of shielded cable including multiple conductor cables with connectors not intended for RF usage. Cables may be tested in their final configuration without need for modification or removal of insulation, etc. Results are given for tests made under various conditions and are compared with results obtained previously with the triaxial test method. Evaluation of the test procedure for testing small shielded enclosures was performed by testing suitable boxes equipped with leakage openings that could be moved to various points on the surface of the box. The results indiate that the general effect on shielding of a particular type of opening remains much the same regardless of its location or orientation. Results are given for a number of opening designs under various conditions of test."
"Use is made of the Fourier integral to derive an expression for the radiation field of spherical reflectors which are corrected for spherical aberration with the use of a subreflector. Calculations for some cases of interest show the sidelobe radiation to be 5.6 dB higher than in a uniformly illuminated aperture."

"This review paper on the Comité International Spécial des Perturbations Radioélectriques (International Special Committee on Radio Interference) presents objectives (\"to promote international agreement on many aspects of radio interference . . .\"), member organizations, and structure. There are three subcommittees (on limits, on methods of measurement, and on safety) which meet in plenary assembly every three years. Inputs to these subcommittees are furnished by ten working groups that meet, usually yearly, to discuss specific study questions which may lead to a report. In many cases they lead to recommendations; member national committees of the International Electrotechnical Committee then may ask their governments to approve pertinent legislation."
"Measurement of the occupied bandwidth is not a simple matter as the term is now defined. This is particularly true for emissions which are measured at a great distance from the transmitter. The emission class studied here is frequency modulation with noise as the modulating signal. The emitted spectrum is first separated into three parts, namely, spurious emissions, harmonic emissions, and the fundamental emission. The first of these is discussed qualitatively, whereas the second and the third are treated quantitatively. An equation is given for computing the maximum expected amplitude of the harmonic emissions. A probability density function has been found that links the Laplacian and the Gaussian probabilities. This function is then used to demonstrate the practicality of a measurement method and to aid in the justification for a modification to the existing definition of occupied bandwidth."
"A method is described for measuring low-level time-truncated signals by using narrow-bandwidth synchronous time-notch filters. These filter systems, intended for use with ordinary narrowband receivers or field intensity meters, provide a means of isolating time-truncated signals of interest from adjacent interfering signals. In addition, the important property of near optimum sensitivity (approaching that of a matched filter) is discussed, and the laboratory results of a low-frequency time-notch filter covering the 500-Hz to 2-MHz range are given."
"The method of moments is applied to wire antennas. Antenna analysis and beam pattern synthesis methods are outlined. Constraints appropriate to problems of EMC can readily be introduced. Some of the subjects treated are coupling, parasitic effects, pattern synthesis, null placement, and gain maximization. Numerous examples are given to illustrate the theory."
"This paper discusses analytical and experimental results of a study on streamer formation, discharge waveforms, and RF noise levels. Measurements disclose typical pulse parameters as follows: rise time = 20 ns, discharge time = 80 ns, and pulsewidth < 600 ns (dependent upon test sample). A mathematical model is developed to represent electric field strength in the vicinity of the streamer with supporting measured values."

"Phase modulation with an analytic signal, which is a Gaussian random process, is examined in order to determine the amount of spectrum conservation that may be achieved by using single-sideband phase modulation (SSB-PM) rather than conventional phase modulation (PM). The autocorrelation function is derived and found to be an analytic signal in terms of the autocorrelation function of the actual modulating signal and its Hilbert transform. When the modulating signal strength is very low, the sideband spectral distribution is the same as that of the actual modulating signal or single-sideband amplitude modulation. As the modulating signal mean-square value is increased, the sideband spectrum broadens and approaches a Gaussian shape. The average power output of an SSB-PM system increases exponentially with input modulating signal strength, while the carrier power remains constant. For the same modulating signal mean-square value, a greater fraction of power is in the one sideband of an SSB-PM system than in the two sidebands of conventional PM. Single-sideband phase or frequency modulation always effectuates spectrum conservation in the continuum when it is compared with conventional phase or frequency modulation on the basis of equal relative sideband power. A Fourier transform computer program is used to generate SSB-PM spectral distributions with varying modulating signal mean-square values, when the modulating signal spectrum is a low-pass rectangular spectrum, a narrowband pass spectrum, and the shape of an average voice spectrum. These examples illustrate the power series formulation of the output spectrum as well as the theoretical analysis of bandwidth."
"Two statistical cosite signal-prediction models are developed taking into account the effect of mutual coupling between antennas on a finite conductive earth. Both models predict the expected values of the desired and interfering signals, their standard deviations and correlation coefficients at the input terminals of a communication receiver, when such a receiver is in the near field of a transmitting antenna. Sufficient measured data are not available in the literature for various parameters of these models. The model must, therefore, be kept updated as measured data become available. Model 2 is in a form suitable for practical application. Further work is needed before Model 1 can be actually useful."
"The central limit theorem may be invoked for man-made incidental radio noise to establish the limiting statistical distribution which is approached as either the noise source-to-observer distance or the observation frequency is increased. As these parameters separately increase, the distribution of the received noise-voltage envelope for either surface or airborne noise is shown to approach a Rayleigh distribution. Conversion of the impulsive noise voltage envelope distribution to a Rayleigh distribution occurs through a combination of effects associated with both the radio propagation process and the spectral density of the noise sources. Free-space spreading and the dispersion of irregular terrain for low-height antennas are the propagation processes which contribute to the conversion of the noise statistics measured by constant-gain antennas. The noise emission spectra, derivable from a Poisson process below the VHF band and from a white-noise process in the upper VHF and UHF bands contribute the second factor to the noise-dispersion function. Existing in-flight observations, although qualitative, of impulsive noise distribution transformations with increasing range are predicted. Additional predictions of impulsive noise-voltage envelopedistribution conversion to a Rayleigh distribution are made for both airborne and surface observations as either the observation frequency or the range increases."
"To help fill the need for environmental data essential to the design of reliable space-communications systems, a swept super-heterodyne radio-frequency interference receiver was developed for flight on the Lincoln Laboratory LES-5 and LES-6 experimental- communication satellites. The LES-6 receiver was adapted for use on an Air Force KC-135 aircraft. The receiver was designed to measure average power and peak power in the bands from 233 to 258 MHz and from 290 to 315 MHz. The aircraft was flown on a world-wide data collection mission during February and March 1967. The data were collected from an altitude of 30 000 feet. A compilation of the data collected on this flight is presented in graphical form."
"Antennas radiating in free space or above a reflecting plane produce radiation patterns which are in general predictable. When these same antennas are mounted on bodies such as aircraft, submarines, or satellites, secondary currents may be induced on the fuselages and nearby conducting members. These secondary currents often result in unpredictable radiation in the forms of newly introduced polarizations or unwanted lobe structures which together may manifest themselves in the form of radio-frequency interference. As a model of the fuselage of either of the aforementioned conducting bodies, a cylinder of finite length is considered and the radiation fields of a radial dipole in the immediate vicinity of such a cylinder are determined by a theoretical-numerical technique. A cross- polarized field due to axial currents induced along the cylinder is found to represent a predominant feature of the radiation characteristics of the dipole-cylinder configuration."
"A mathematical model, which predicts the far-field power pattern of a wire antenna bent in one plane, is developed, and the classical approximation of a sinusoidal current distribution along the arc length is employed, neglecting all end and mutual coupling effects. General expressions for the complex Poynting vector, electric- and magnetic-field intensities are also derived in terms of the retarded vector potential. Although the theory for parabolically-bent antennas compares favorably with experiment, it is shown that the agreement is more favorable when the current distribution is computed by the method of moments. In contrast to the figure-eight θ-plane pattern of the conventional straight dipole, the circularly and parabolically bent antennas operating at the first resonance are shown to have radiation patterns approaching omnidirection as the bending curvature is optimized, thus lending themselves to use as replacements for many common dipole applications for gain standards, field probing, reflector feeds, as well as mobile and broadcast antennas."
"The authors describe a mathematical model for a long conductor exposed to a high-intensity transient electric field to aid in determining interface requirements at connected equipment. Dipole characteristics of the conductors are used to simulate the impedance and in turn to calculate the induced currents. Example calculations for four models, two conductor lengths, and two conductor sizes, are presented and compared."
"The two-dimensional flux distribution in a magnetic shield of constant permeability and conductivity is presented in a series of magnetic vector-potential contour plots. The plots show the leakage-flux tubes in the shield and in the shielded region. Three- dimensionless parameters representing the shielding 1) thickness, 2) skin depth, and 3) permeability are introduced as the flux-distribution variables. The induced eddy currents cause the resulting fields in the shield to be elliptically polarized and to break into a characteristic cell structure which increases in complexity with rising frequency."
"A numerical technique is developed that may be used to analyze the shielding characteristics of a cable with a saturable ferromagnetic outer sheath in an intense low-frequency environment. The solution relates the center conductor current to the total current exciting a coaxial cable with a ferromagnetic sheath. Several examples are given to illustrate how saturation effects the shielding properties of a ferromagnetic sheath."
"Previously, a numerical solution was evolved that may be used to analyze the effect of material saturation on the low frequency shielding characteristics of a thin ferromagnetic cable shield. Numerical solutions are difficult to employ in design problems and so a simplified theory has also been developed. This supplemental theory, described here, yields simple equations useful in the design of ferromagnetic cable shields to provide protection against some anticipated intense low frequency environment."

 "The channel capacity of a communication channel made available to a user on a shared basis with other users is here considered. An overall system bandwidth B is divided into segments and parceled out to subscribers in an overlapping manner. Viewing emissions by the sharing user as Gaussian noise, the channel capacity is treated as a random variable, and its probability function, mean, and variance are studied. For a fixed power to each user, it is found that the average capacity of a user is maximum when the number of multiple assignments of a frequency band is approximately the inverse of the probability of use. The increase in channel capacity over exclusive assignment is also determined. The probability function of the capacity is worked out for some specific case to show its dependence on the frequency assignment policy, and a general procedure for determining the probability function is given."
"One of the factors involved in communication system performance is the electromagnetic interference environment (broad-band radiated electronic noise). Attempts are often made to use commercially available radio-frequency interference field intensity meters for these measurements. Measurements made with these instruments are of limited use since detector functions like peak and quasi-peak are not useful parameters in statistical communication theory. It is recommended, instead, that rms voltage be measured simultaneously with average voltage and average logarithm of the voltage. These latter three parameters may be used to infer the amplitude probability distribution, which is a required statistic for predicting the performance of communication systems. Data are given on dynamic range requirements for accurate measurement of these statistical parameters for a given man-made noise sample. An Appendix contains several hardware solutions to the problems posed in this paper."
"The reception of a nonhomogeneous signal field embedded in a homogeneous noise field, using a simple two-element subtractive array, is studied. For element spacing which is small compared to both the distance to the source and to the center-frequency-wavelength, the signal-to-noise improvement over a single element is shown to be independent of element spacing d, relatively independent of bandwidth and the noise spatial distribution, and to depend only on the distance to the signal source in wavelengths and on the signal ground-wave attenuation rate."
"An accurate numerical representation of the electromagnetic field in the near zone of a cylindrical monopole oriented perpendicular to a highly conducting ground screen and driven at its base is needed for use in calibrating field strength measuring equipment. The fields Hϕ(p,z), Ep(p,z), and Ez(p,z) are given by different integrals. The integrands are formed by multiplying the current distribution Iz(z) by certain derivations of K(p, z _ z') = e-jßR/R taken by hand, where ß is the radian wavenumber and \\begin{equation*}R = \\sqrt{(z - z^\\prime)^2 + p^2}.\\end{equation*}. Alternatively, the integrands may be constructed by multiplying K(p,z - z') by certain derivatives of Iz(z). The current Iz(z) is obtained by solving an integral equation with feedpoint correction employing a linear zoning technique. Generally speaking for a tubular monopole, the current may be obtained to any desired accuracy, and, of course, it is bounded at the driving point. The integrands are then formed, and the resulting integral expressions for the fields are evaluated using a digital computer. By this means it is felt that accurate numerical values of the fields Hϕ(p,z), Ep(p,z), and Ez(p,z) in the vicinity of the monopole are found, excluding observation points near the feedpoint and end of the radiator. A brief discussion of the methodology employed in programming the Chang theory is presented."
"Many new urban applications of radiolocation technology in both cooperative and noncooperative forms are anticipated in law enforcement and urban planning fields. Until recently, virtually no data were available regarding passive radiolocation of urban targets by conventional techniques such as direction finding. Recent radiolocation experiments performed at 165 kHz and 100 MHz were used to measure transmitter locations with increasing urbanization. Urban radiolocation errors in range and azimuth as a function of urbanization are given for the downtown area of San Antonio, Tex., showing increasing error with increasing urbanization. Procedures to improve urban radiolocation performance are suggested."

  "The rapidly increasing density of air traffic has created a demand for instrumentation to reduce the possibility of air catastrophes due to collision. The incidence of reported near-collisions is now estimated to be over 2000 per year in the United States, and represents a serious threat to the future growth of air travel. Since mid-1967, research has been conducted by NASA and the Research Triangle Institute to develop techniques for evaluation of collision warning systems and to determine the characteristics of the operational environment. Actual aircraft traffic data have been obtained by the FAA from the radar system at the Atlanta Airport. These data have been analyzed to determine encounter statistics which would result with various forms of warning criteria. This paper reviews the definition of several proposed warning criteria and presents the results of the statistical analyses of the data. Probabilities of encounter, encounter rates, and average encounter durations are determined for various definitions of the encounter."
"This paper describes a simplified solution of the space rendezvous problem based on optical sightings taken with a hand-held sextant entered into and processed by a small digital computer. Compared to the manual method described in [1], this approach greatly reduces the astronaut's work load. Also, the computer can provide a more accurate solution, can present more flight plan options (allowing more tradeoffs between fuel usage and time), and can allow greater freedom in the sequencing of measurements and maneuvers. Physical characteristics, input-output parameters, and logic design of the computer are briefly described."
"This paper discusses one area of research being carried out at the NASA/Electronics Research Center in strapdown guidance technology. In particular, the task of determining the characteristics of the onboard computer is examined. Strapdown calculations impose unique constraints on the computational requirements of the flight computer. In addition, this computer should be suitable for prolonged unmanned missions, which involves system reliability. The approach set forth in this paper appears to provide the requisite computational ability and long-term reliability. A description of this ideal system is followed by a description of the first implementation of this approach, the modular computer breadboard."
"Systems which utilize acoustic energy to explore an undersea environment are called sonars. This introductory and tutorial paper presents a discussion of active sonar signal analysis concentrating upon sinusoidal, linear FM, and pseudorandom echolocation pulses. Many previously published results concerning sonar signals and their haracteristics are integrated, collected, and presented in a unified form such as to portray typical signal design considerations."
"A general procedure for analyzing ground clutter effects in airborne pulse Doppler radars is described. The quantity computed is the expected clutter power at the output of any specified range gate/ Doppler filter processing cell. The procedure has been computerized and is quite general with respect to antenna gain pattern, clutter cross section variation, PRF, pulse and range gate shapes, and the various receiver processing functions. It is applicable only to distributed ground clutter and linear processing, and excludes the dynamic effects of continuous antenna scanning. To exemplify the use of the procedure, two studies conducted for a postulated high PRF radar are described, and the results are presented."
"The microwave CLFM study was directed to generating 14 us S-band pulses of 1000 MHz bandwidth and an rms phase error of a few degrees. Over 972 MHz bandwidth, the sampled phase error relative to the reference was 7 degrees rms and 17 degrees peak, with a maximum Fourier component of 4 degrees. The FM pulse train is generated by a gated BWO driven by a stable linearizing waveform. Phase coherency during each pulse is obtained by a sampling technique, where the phase is corrected at intervals of 1/6 us, the RF phase having changed an integral number of cycles in each interval. Multiplication of the BWO signal by the sampling pulse train results in band-limited phase error pulses which are applied in a feedback loop. Pulse-to-pulse coherency is obtained by phase lock of the BWO starting frequency to the crystal reference. Feedback leveling holds the output constant to 0.3 dB. The basic MITRE technique was originally demonstrated at 10 MHz in 1964. Range results measured with the X-band model radar using the CLFM generator are given and confirm the phase errors of the CLFM."
"The realization of a rectangular pulse-compression waveform having low time sidelobes and zero mismatch loss due to spectral weighting is discussed. The theoretical aspects of the design of such a waveform are presented with particular reference to frequency modulated, rectangular pulses. The design and performance of a matched-filter pulse-compression system having essentially zero mismatch loss are presented. The system discussed has a time-bandwidth product of 22 and time sidelobes suppressed at least 27 dB; the measured mismatch loss is 0.1 dB. The difficulty of achieving the required nonlinear time delay dispersion is overcome by synthesizing the dispersive network as a cascade of all-pass networks."
"A signal processor that provides ratio-squared predetection combining, has been investigated for application in an adaptive antenna array. The analysis and experimental data presented here pertain to the signal processing gain when the antenna array is illuminated by a coherent signal source and a partially coherent noise source. For a noise source which is coherent, the processing gain depends on relative strength of the signal and noise, relative directions of arrival, and the usual \"array factor.\" The array exhibits capturing effects much as in an FM receiver. The effective antenna pattern is a superposition of two beams of different magnitudes, one directed to the signal source and the other to the noise source. When the noise is partially coherent, the behavior of the signal processor is quite complex. Analytical prediction and experimental simulation measurement on a four-channel system indicate that the partially coherent noise may be regarded as the source of an incoherent noise component plus a coherent noise component with the magnitude of the latter determined by the coherence coefficient for the noise source."
"Two five-parameter singular improper integrals arising in cross-correlation problems are evaluated, and corresponding nonelementary Laplace inversion formulas are derived."
"This paper describes the design of a digital cross correlator and its application in determining the impulse response in linear systems. The output of the cross correlator, which correlates the input and the output of a linear system excited by noise, is the same as the response of the linear system to a pulse which is identical to the noise autocorrelation. The impulse response error is defined as the normalized mean-square deviation of the actual from the true impulse response. A digital computer simulation confirms that the conventional technique yields the same impulse error as the correlation technique, when the width of the input rectangular pulse is equivalent to the width of the noise autocorrelation function. The operation and design of the digital correlator are discussed. An advantage of the specially designed digital correlator over a general-purpose digital computer is to operate in real time without problems of software and storage. The presented experimental and digitally computed results show that the digital correlator can accurately determine the impulse response, even in presence of perturbations. Only the correlation technique allows measurement of system impulse response without disturbing normal operation. Suggestions are made to simplify the design and improve the speed (bandwidth capability)."
"The effect of a constant synchronization error on PN systems has been studied by Gill [1]. His results are generalized here for random synchronization errors, and extended to PSK systems using decision directed channel measurements [2]. In both cases, it is shown that the effect of random synchronization errors is to reduce the effective input signal power and to introduce an additional self-noise. The effect is minimized when the synchronization error has zero mean and can easily be evaluated in terms of circuit parameters."

 "The Department of Transportation Air Traffic Control Advisory Committee concentrated on control of aircraft through the airspace, from takeoff to landing. Emphasis was placed on major terminal areas and on the denser portions of the enroute airspace where the need for efficient use of scarce resources (principally runways and terminal airspace) and the danger of mid-air collisions make sophisticated air traffic control mandatory if safety is to be assured without sacrifice of capacity. Airports were included in the study insofar as they strongly interact with air traffic control, and then, primarily, the committee's concern was with efficient use of runways. No work was done on airport access. Considerable effort was placed on the subject of noise reduction which may be critical to community acceptance of high-capacity airports."
"Involvement in concept engineering forces the individual as well as corporations to consider aspects and disciplines concerned with public utility, taste, and convenience. The marketplaces are varied and in a state of flux. Nevertheless, personal entrepreneurship as exemplified by high technology efforts in the aerospace, computer, and electronics industries is essential and identified as a basic American characteristic. Individuals and corporations are challenged to channel their efforts and organization to attack broad social objectives, currently recogned but awaiting clarification and polarization of the environment, to allow technology, via effective concept engineering, to participate in the achievement of successes equal to those attained in consumer products, defense engineering, and space exploration."

"The future development trends in military communication satellite repeaters will be dictated by greater spacecraft capability in terms of payload size, weight, power, and complexity, and attempts to better satisfy the satellite user's needs and desires. This paper presents the basic repeater configurations that have been employed and those that can be expected in the future, along with the user and development constraints on advanced repeater designs. The discussion points out the diverging trends in RF frequency to allow easy user pointing and provide greater capacity, the trend toward channelization within the repeater, and the various methods used to reduce susceptibility to interference. Examples are given of advanced repeaters, which demodulate and process received signals, which transmit and receive on the same frequency, and which route RF signals between antennas. Also discussed is the possibility of employing a large processing ground station and the impact of future repeater configurations on terminal designs."
"On February 8, 1969, an experimental tactical communications satellite, TACSAT I, was successfully placed in synchronous orbit at the equator off the coast of South America. This paper concerns itself with a family of SHF tactical satellite communications ground terminals utilizing the SHF capability of that satellite. The material presented provides the system concepts necessary for the understanding of the ground terminals, their relationship to the satellite, and some insight into the design problems encountered during the development of a family of five types of terminals. The system concepts are presented in terms of communication modes, frequency assignments, and implementation of the respective modes. The beacon system for frequency control and signal acquisiticn siticn is described along with the factors involved in design of equipment implementing the analog FM, the alert message, frequency hopping, and, differential phase-shift keyed (DPSK) modes. The final configurations of each of the five terminals are described and illustrated through photographs and generalized block diagrams, and the capability of each is briefly outlined."
"A review and comparison of the weights, sizes, and costs of nuclear and non-nuclear spacecraft power systems is presented and discussed. Nuclear power systems include the range below 10 kW, with an electrical output to weight ratio of 0.5 to 1.0 pounds per watt. Comparisons show that primary batteries are lighter for short-duration missions of a few hours; fuel cells are lighter for durations of one to two months; and solar-cell/secondary battery combinations are to be preferred when sunlight is adequate."
"Users of satellite communication systems being designed are charcterized by diversity. System designers now have the capability of serving thousands of simultaneous users; the users need not all follow the same system parameters. Diversity and characteristics are shown, and an attempt is made to list all the parameters desired by users. Usage of satellite communications systems is projected to serve a maximum of 200 000 users by means of 10 multipurpose satellites. It is shown that a supervisory control system is necessary to achieve optimal utilization of the existing resources."
"A type of analog integrating moving window detector for use with a scanning pulse radar is examined. A performance analysis is carried out, which takes into account both the radiation pattern of the antenna and the dynamic character of the detection process due to the angular scanning of the antenna. An expression for the false alarm rate of the detector is first derived and evaluated numerically. The detection performance and angular accuracy are next determined in a direct Monte Carlo simulation of the detector on a digital computer for both no fading and pulse-to-pulse Rayleigh fading. Finally the influence on detection performance of the width used for the moving window is investigated."
"Tactical air defense systems often require the interchange of target tracking data between two radar sites. This paper presents a systematic and effective procedure, employing correlation gates, for associating , or correlating, track information from one site with that from the other. Using the correlation equation, gate sizes are selected, based on remote and local tracking accuracies, target separation, the number of track coordinates investigated, and the number of successive correlation attempts made, to maximize the selected measure of correlation accuracy. The modeling of physical encounters is discussed and a representative situation is selected for analysis. A variety of correlation procedures are compared in terms of correlation accuracy and ease of implementation."
"This paper reviews system configuration requirements and analyzes detectability performance characteristics for maximum likelihood array reception of multipath. Performance is analyzed to determine the effects of channel multipath structure (multipath delay and signal power division among the paths), space-time correlation properties of the incident processes, and the array spacing. It is shown by a series of case studies, that for single element coupling, as well as array coupling, an increased multipath delay factor results in decreased system detectability for fixed signal and noise intensity levels. The performance capacity is degraded as the available signal power tends to distribute more uniformly between the paths. These effects are attributed to the loss of effective signal energy concentration, resulting in a lower effective pre-detection signal-to-noise ratio. An investigation of the effects upon system performance, due to array element spacing, shows that performance is enhanced by increasing the spacing relative to the multipath delay factor and the reciprocal signal bandwidth. The former is the result of a more directive detectability (beam) pattern arising from the increased spacing. In effect, with increased spacing, the main lobe of the pattern is narrowed, while the side lobes are optimally suppressed by the required noise related array element link, frequency filters (weights)."
"\"Integral relay\" is a relay concept in which all the aircraft in a control sector that are under the control of an Army flight operations center (FOC) are electronically capable of functioning as relays for communication with aircraft out of direct contact with the FOC. This paper deals with the effectiveness of integral relay operations based on the assumption of random spatial distribution of aircraft. It describes the development of a control sector line-of-sight (LOS) model and of a methodology for effectiveness analysis, and the application of the methodology to one numerical example. It is shown that the LOS conditions in the control sector may be represented by two LOS characteristics which are functions of both aircraft clearance and the terrain and FOC characteristics. Probabilities of direct and indirect (via relay) LOS between the FOC and randomly located aircraft are derived for operations without and with integral relay. The effectiveness, expressed as an increase in LOS probability, is a function of aircraft density and the above two LOS characteristics and is representative of the control sector as a whole. Numerical results are obtained by probability analysis and statistical sampling."
"Results of a study leading to the preparation of a concept formulation package and development plan for automation of record communications on a world-wide basis during the 1970' s are presented. The Automatic Base Communication System (ABCS), centered on an electronic store and forward message switch, utilizes stored programs to handle all U. S. Air Force base record communications."
"The theoretical channel capacity of a switching device is far in excess of that utilized in a binary-coded system. One of the motivations of our research has been the attempt to increase the channel capacity by representing information by the interval between pulses instead of the presence or absence of pulses. A second motivation is the desire to find a practical use for microelectronic devices now under development which may encompass a billion gates in a cubic inch. The third motivation is the similarity between the nervous system and a Time Interval Modulation Information Coding system (TIMIC). In our initial studies we have utilized an operational element, called \"sumister,\" which is essentially a model of an artificial neuron interpreted as a decision-making threshold device with the ability of temporal and spacial summation and short-term memory. Five basic component networks have been designed, the ON cell, the OFF cell, a conjunctive network, an object-detection network, and an autocorrelation network. These are combined into moving-object detection networks and a metaphase-chromosome detection network."
"The classical problem is considered of locating a fading sinusoidal signal known to be present in one of several frequency \" cells,\" each of which contains additive white Gaussian noise. The signal fading is assumed to follow the popular Rayleigh distribution, but generalizations tions to non-Rayleigh fading are included in terms of the \" in\" distribution due to Nakagami. The channel observation time is allowed to be either predetermined or variable (corresponding, respectively, to \" fixed sample size\" and \" sequential\" reception), and the practically important situation of intermittent signal transmissions is also examined. Results are in the form of optimal and near-optimal receiver structures, and of measures of performance."
"Analysis of the switched self-balancing comparison radiometer with coupling between the channels is given. The comparison source is a stationary, zero-mean white noise generator of known spectral density. An expression for the power spectrum at the output of the radiometer is derived. It is shown that measurement errors due to interchannel coupling can be corrected by phase switching. Radiometer sensitivity is also calculated. The switched version of the radiometer has been simulated at low frequencies and is under construction at X-band."
 "The expression of the probability density function PClick(T) of the duration r of the clicks is determined as a function of 1) the expected number of clicks per second, Felick 2) the expected number of times per second that the noise component x(t) in phase with the carrier has instantaneous amplitude larger than that of the carrier itself 3) the probability density function peross(T) of the duration of the time intervals in which x(t) < -A 4) the probability that the values of the noise component in quadrature with the carrier will be of opposite sign at the extremes of time intervals of duration v. Using for Pcross(T) an approximate formula that holds fairly well in the range of the values of the signal-to-noise power ratio α usually encountered, PIick(T) has been calculated for several values of a and for two shapes of the noise spectrum, Gaussian and rectangular. Finally, an expression is given for the mean value of T."

"In this correspondence, the threshold carrier power of FM/FM systems and the receiver IF bandwidth are optimized through a computer program. For a typical set of IRIG (inter-range instrumentation group) channels, it is demonstrated that the required carrier signal-to-noise ratio can be as low as 5 dB (much less than the conventional 12 dB value) in order to maintain the subcarrier signal-to-noise ratio at 12 dB, the threshold level. comparison of the optimized and the conventional taper analysis is tabulated."

 "Electronic composition systems which are presently becoming available may be as revolutionary to the graphic arts industry as was the introduction of the linecasting machine. These systems will eventually effect the complete publication cycle̲from author's manuscript to, and including, plate making and distribution. The initial impact of the electronic systems will be felt primarily by the editorial and composing departments. The following is a very brief discussion limited to the effect of such an electronic composition system."

"A dual-mode algorithm for routing an unmanned autonomous roving vehicle designed to explore the uncertain terrain of other planets is presented. The algorithm consists of a global mode, which uses dynamic programming and terrain information available from photo reconnaissance data to determine a nominal optimal path, and a local mode, which routes the vehicle around obstacles whose presence, location, and extent are not known in advance. Gaussian probability density functions are used to simulate terrain for examples that illustrate the performance of the algorithm."
"From among the many inverse shape and motion techniques considered in our work, a review is made of four methods for target mapping using coherent monostatic and multistatic measurements. These methods can provide a wide variety of shape description: surface outline, a map of discontinuities, or a viewable image in two or three dimensions. The paper discusses the form of the resulting target descriptions, as well as the kind of processing-and measurements required. In so doing, the discussion also provides an account of the nature of inverse scattering techniques in general."
"The effect of bounded deterministic disturbances (external and/or internal) on a chosen performance index (PI) is investigated. Upper and lower bounds of the PI about a nominal value are determined by the application of the optimum control theory. A computational procedure is also proposed to determine an approximately optimal feedback controller for time-lag systems. Such a controller is designed here on the basis of min-max criteria. Numerical examples illustrate the proposed approach."
"The transient responses during the initialization phase of a first-order α-ß tracking filter and a second-order Kalman filter are evaluated as a function of radar measurement accuracy and the probability of receiving valid data at the prescribed intervals. Monte Carlo simulation results are complemented by analysis of the filtering processes and curves are presented which clearly define the deterioration in filter performance attributable to reduced probabilities of data acquisition. In addition, the responses of α-ß and Kalman filters are shown to be identical when the α, ß gains are selected optimally."
"In a recent paper [1] the authors presented an optimization strategy for the transmission of analog data over a PCM telemetry link. Constraints imposed included real-time operation and both average and peak power limitations on the transmitter. The selected strategy used Karhunen-Loeve (KL) sampling, unequal bit assignments, optimum uniform quantizing, the natural code, and PSK reception. In this paper, the performance of the above system will be compared to the same system using noncoherent FSK reception instead of PSK. The performance criterion used for the comparison is the mean integral squared error criterion."
"The a posteriori probability density function p(θ|X1, X2,...,Xk), where the Xi, i=1, 2, ..., K, represent Kvector-valued observations statistically related to the random vector θ, appears in many applications of the methods of statistical inference to problems in pattern recognition and statistical communication theory. In this paper, it is shown that for equally likely binary sequences (M= 2) of anticorrelated patterns for signals observed in additive Gaussian noise, a device that computes pθ|X1, X2, XK) can be synthesized from a correlator, a simple instantaneous nonlinearity, and a multiplier. These results are used to derive some equally simple structures for various optimum nonsupervised estimators, pattern recognition machines, and signal detectors."
"A formula is derived for the output signal-to-noise power ratio from a limiter-discriminator that is followed by an ideal (rectangular) bandpass filter. This signal-to-noise ratio is shown to be inversely proportional to the difference between the cube of the upper cutoff frequency and the cube of the lower cutoff frequency. The formula commonly utilized by designers for the discriminator output signal-to-noise ratio was derived for the case of a lowpass filter on the discriminator output. The bandpass and low-pass formulas are compared to indicate 1) the advantage of bandpass filtering for the discriminator output, and 2) the error incurred if the designer employs the low-pass formula to evaluate the performance of a bandpass filter design. Finally, the accuracy of a narrow-band approximation for the bandpass formula is evaluated."
"The open loop compensation of vibrationally induced image motion via electronic deflections in an image intensifier is only possible if an adequate image motion transducer is available. It is desirable that this transducer should utilize components which are both available and needed for other purposes in the system. Thus, this investigation is limited to gyros. The nature of the errors in rate and rate-integrating gyros and their ac pick-offs are investigated. Finally, a method of obtaining satisfactory outputs from a set of rateintegrating gyros is developed."
 "A review of the conditions existing in urban areas and a review of the Model Urban Neighborhood Development (MUND) Program in Baltimore are presented. An appeal is voiced for a reversal of national priorities in the interest of national survival and the public interest with regard to housing, urban goals, and social problems so that the quality of life for our cities and their people may be improved."
"This paper describes the existing construction industry as a total system whose flow chart of operations moves from land accumulation through land development to actual construction and ultimate sale to the consumer. Based in part on the author's past experiences as a general building contractor, it focuses upon the historical evolution of the builder as the central figure in today's building processes and demonstrates by examples the complexity, strength, and weaknesses of present housing methods."
"Much has been written about the development of a general systems theory for application to civil problems, but very little documentation exists in the sense of case studies of large-scale programs implemented using the systems approach. The Model Urban Neighborhood Demonstration Program, operating in an inner-city poverty neighborhood in Baltimore, offers some lessons in this regard. With the present state of the art, the techniques of systems analysis are most effective at the subsystem level, and the necessary funding and development time should be afforded to extend their usefulness in the civil order. Existing aerospace companies provide an operating institutional base, with extenasive resources, that can be beneficially translated to solving problems in the public order."
"The suggestion is made that the aerospace industry examine the dynamics of urban structural development, that it identify the forces which act on the elements comprising the structure of the city, and that it describe the relationship between and the relative movements of those elements. By formulating such a general theory of urban structural development, urban political, social, and economic leadership may be given the means by which permanent remedies̲including technological̲may be devised and applied. This paper presents examples of such means and explains their application and effects."

"Urban utilities are the technologies by which are provided life support services, resource distribution, and information transfers to the individuals and institutions in the city. These utilities now require about one third of the budgets of all major cities and are rapidly increasing in cost. Technological innovation in these systems has been minor, yet they are the aspects of urban function most sensitive to technological change. Systems engineering, using criteria based upon urban development needs, and large scale demonstration programs affords the best opportunity for development of utility technologies that satisfy rather than limit urban development and social organization."
"The performance of discriminator detection of wide-band PCM/FM is investigated. Formulas are derived that allow one to predict system performance with the effects of both predetection and postdetection filtering accounted for. In particular, for a postdetection equivalent noise bandwidthbit time product b0T=2, it is shown that best results are obtained with a modulation index ß=0.6. Furthermore, it is shown that performance to within 1.5 dB of theoretical can be obtained."
"The radar cross section of a flat plate has a sin x/x lobe structure. If a synthetic-array radar flies past the plate the resulting image is dependent upon what part of this lobe structure is sampled. When the plate is parallel to the flight path, the image is a line as wide as the plate. If the plate is not parallel, only the discontinuities at the ends of the plate are visible in the image."

The \"hedgehog\" antenna consists of several antennas directed in different directions to cover the whole sky. An electronic switch, controlled by the satellite receiver, connects the receiver to the antenna from which the desired satellite signal is obtained. This system is especially suitable for unmanned reliable receiving stations if an antenna gain of the order of 10 dB is enough."

"Early in 1969 the U. S. Air Force placed into synchronous orbit the largest communications satellite built to date. This vehicle, the tactical communications satellite (TACSAT), together with a variety of ground terminals, is designed to test experimentally and develop tactical communications concepts for all military services. This paper describes the spacecraft design focusing on the communications repeater. Measured performance characteristics affecting communications utilization of the spacecraft are presented."
"The computer controlled frequency surveillance system utilizes a small computer in conjunction with a digital interface unit, to act as the controller between the computer and two completely programmable receivers. It operates in the frequency range from 20 Hz to 1 GHz with a programmed dynamic range of at least 120 dB. The system can, with proper programming, detect, analyze, correlate, and display all of the frequency information which the basic receivers are capable of intercepting. In addition, self-calibrating features are also included as well as the ability to make decisions based on the data received by the receiver. These decision making aspects, or branches in the program allow the frequency surveillance system to perform a multiplicity of functions, which can be predetermined. The basic concepts required in the development of a computer controlled frequency surveillance system are presented. Numerous applications are cited describing the far-reaching potentials inherent in this type of system. The functional operation of the system is discussed in relationship to the receiving systems and the computer programs."
"A low-cost airborne computer which provides a multiangular glide path for the landing problem is independent of ILS or GCA methods. A barometric altitude signal is divided by slant-range information from a DME interrogator. The resulting ground-based angle is subtracted from the selected approach angle to provide the displayed departure from the glide path. Angular and lineal outputs are available. DME station position may be electrically offset to serve all airdrome runways. Theoretical and experimental results are presented"
"In a missile flying a proportional navigation course, the missile heading rate is made proportional to the indicated line of sight rate. While for stationary targets the resulting differential equations of motion can be readily integrated, this is no longer the case for moving targets. To obtain closed-form expressions convenient for the evaluation of trajectory parameters, the assumption is made in this paper that for moving targets, the angular rate of the closing velocity vector is made proportional to the line of sight rather than the actual heading rate."
"A 32-input coherent optical computer system is described which is driven by a membrane Light modulator (MLM). The MLM has an active area of 4 by 4 mm containing a 32 by 74 array of 2368 38-pm diameter light modulating elements. The optical computer calculates the one-dimensional Fourier transform over 32 points of a phase function in 1 μs. Both the theoretical and actual operating characteristics of the computer are presented."
"Electron concentration and Hall mobility have been investigated in pure zinc oxide single crystals, while in the dark and under ultraviolet (UV) excitation. Mode of scattering in ZnO has been determined by studying the temperature dependence of various electrical parameters in the range from -170 to 120°C. It has been observed that the degradation to the crystals by UV irradiation is limited only to the surface layer and shows up only at relatively lower temperatures, which is in contrast to the degradation behavior in thin films and powders."
"The majority of tactical weapons systems require that manned maneuverable vehicles, such as aircraft, ships, and submarines, be tracked accurately. An optimal Kalman filter has been derived for this purpose using a target model that is simple to implement and that represents closely the motions of maneuvering targets. Using this filter, parametric tracking accuracy data have been generated as a function of target maneuver characteristics, sensor observation noise, and data rate and that permits rapid a priori estimates of tracking performance to be made when maneuvering targets are to be tracked by sensors providing any combination of range, bearing, and elevation measurements."
"The phenomenon of cycle slipping in a first-order phase-locked loop is reconsidered and a simple expression for the expected number λ of cycles slipped per second is given in the form of a rapidly converging series. In this way the computation of λ becomes much easier than with previously known formulas. A formula allowing the computation of the expected number of cycles gained or lost per second is also given. These results are obtained by extending a technique used by Viterbi. The outcome of experimental verifications of the theory is also reported."
"The leakage reactance of the machine is expressed as an equation involving slot leakage, end-connection leakage, differential leakage, stator-halves leakage, and tooth-top leakage reactance. This leakage reactance equation, or objective function, is then minimized under suitable constraints. Geometric programming is used to carry through the optimization procedure. A computer program is developed and applied to find the optimum leakage reactance for a 95 kVA, 208 V, wye-connected, 40 800 r/min aerospace alternator, using 8-, 10-, and 12-pole machines."
"The prime purpose of this paper is to describe the characteristics and application of high powered Zener diodes as transient suppressors for transients emanating in ground vehicle and aircraft power supplies. Information is presented on voltage transients as specified in MIL-STD-704 for aircraft and MIL-STD-1275(AT) for military ground vehicles and the ability of advanced high power Zener diodes in suppressing the levels of voltages specified therein. A complete transient suppressor capable of operating externally to the equipment intended for protection is also described."
"Propagation errors along paths between an array radar and a distribution of targets cause degradations in angle measurements and detection range. The overall objective of the research described in this paper was to analyze and demonstrate the use of conjugate reflections for compensating adverse effects of path errors. The effect of reflecting the conjugate of an incident wave is described mathematically and is demonstrated by computer simulation. Repeated conjugate reflections are shown to result in the formation of a single beam usually focussed on a target highlight. Echoes from this spatial reference, or \"beacon\" are shown to provide the means by which aperture phase errors may be effectively compensated. Results of radar simulations include two-way patterns computed for an example involving a distribution of three-point targets and half-wave-length Gaussian aperture errors. Without compensation a gain loss of 12 dB is computed; with error correction, based on echoes from an adaptively focussed beam, the two-way pattern is within a small fraction of a dB of the ideal pattern. The effect of noise on adaptive beacon forming was considered for a case involving one target. Repeated conjugate reflections improve signal-to-noise ratio as long as the effect of noise is less than the effect of aperture dephasing on the power reflected back to the target. An example is presented in which signal-to-noise ratio at the output of the receiver combining network is increased from 4 to 11.8 dB."
"The determination of the range of radar is carried out according to statistical methods which are not always immediate. For this reason, a parametrical method is proposed which condenses the elements necessary for this calculation in the form of three abaci. Furthermore, a general formula condenses this result, and the formula is extended to the other transmission systems."
"A method is presented for the calculation of the detection probabilities for a scanning radar employing feedback integration. An equation is developed for the optimum feedbacd value̲ the equation holds for small and large sample sizes and for fluctuating and nonfluctuating targets. Then, a value for the antenna beam-shape factor is given which enables one to calculate detection probabilities."
"The likelihood functional for estimating parameter differences in coherent multiple-sensor receivers is developed assuming Gaussian statistics on both signal and noise. The development relies on a matrix formulation and a subsequent factorization of a parameter constraint matrix from the signal matrix. A two-antenna phase-difference radar example is presented for cases of uncorrelated and antenna-correlated noise."
"When the problem of predicting the past, present, or future value of a polynomial signal or any of its derivatives is considered, where the signal is in white Gaussian noise, the standard approach has been to minimize mean-square-error with constraints by use of Lagrange multipliers. In this paper an alternate approach is described, using results of Rao and Bhattacharyya from the statistical literature, which reduce the specified prediction problem to a simple one requiring no formal minimizations and no use of Lagrange multipliers. It further has the advantage of yielding the covariances between estimates of the polynomial and its derivates. Useful engineering formulas for smoothing and prediction are developed in the main part of the paper. These include both filter and covariance expressions. A tutorial discussion of the theory is given in two appendixes."
"For typical failure rates the probability of two or more of four gyros failing is very much less than one or both of two. Thus, a single redundancy system of four gyros greatly enhances system reliability. The orientation of the sensitive axes of four gyros is specified and means of generating outputs dependent only on gyro inconsistencies are defined. The voting logic and plots of switching decision zones are developed. The hardware required to implement this logic is shown to be simple and thus reliable. The use of rate integrating gyros requires the limitation of error integration time in order to avoid spurious failure signals. This is achieved by a reset cycle which realigns the four gyros at regular intervals. False error signals can be generated if inputs are large enough to exceed linear ranges of various components downstream of the gyros."
"This paper presents an overview of the identification and selection process of experiments and payloads for manned space flight missions, emphasizing the scope and magnitude of the problem of doing activity planning and the need for a methodology to assure timely flight and appropriate spacecraft design. Conclusions and results derived from the past several years are presented together with an analysis of the current procedure for defining activity for the space station."
"Experiments for manned and unmanned space facilities of the next decade will impose stringent requirements for accurately pointing and/or maintaining stability of the space platforms over extended periods. Potential experiment programs identified to date in various NASA-and contractor-sponsored studies have been reviewed in order to define critical values and ranges for the following pointing/stability parameters: 1) pointing accuracy, 2) line-of-sight stability, 3) angular rate, and/or 4) acceleration level. The most stringent requirements were found to be in the research categories of: stellar and solar astronomy, earth observations, space physics, communications and navigation, and space biology."
"Logistics support of a long duration space station will dictate a high degree of space flight activity to rotate personnel and transport supplies and equipment. Systems characteristics and mission requirements for space station logistics have been analyzed within the context of a broad spectrum of space missions. Preliminary concepts for a space shuttle system (space transportation) have been developed. This system can support not only a space station program, but a wide variety of space missions for both NASA and the DOD."
"Artificial pilot phased array (APPA) is a system designed for application as a multiple narrow-beam communication satellite. The design uses an adaptive array principle in a multiple-beam configuration. Two ground pilot signals are used to make beam steering independent of array attitude. Beam steering is accomplished without the requirement of user pilots by deriving array phase shifter settings from user locations. The system's principle of operation is persented along with a description of a laboratory model and a design application to a data relay satellite."
"The techniques of recursive estimation and Kalman filtering are applied to the problem of estimation of space vehicle orbits and trajectories using only measurements of the Doppler shifts in radio signals transmitted by or reflected from the target. Two approaches are described. One is a global fit technique in which the parameters of an assumed trajectory model are estimated. The second is a pointwise mapping technique in which the trajectory estimate is extrapolated as the target tracking data is received. The paper provides a tutorial illustration of the direct application of recursive optimization techniques to a class of engineering problems."
"An arcing amplifier in a large amplifier array operating from a common power supply and energy storage bank must be isolated from the rest of the system to permit continuous operation of the system. A gas-tube isolator circuit is proposed wherein the tube is programmed to charge the individual secondary capacitance bank of each amplifier during the interpulse interval. Since the gas tube is nonconducting during the pulsing period of the amplifier, it isolates the amplifier from the rest of the system in case of a fault."
 "It is suggested that signal design to eliminate intersymbol interference will significantly improve the performance of all cases considered in the correspondence by Park."
"PCM system transmission error causes error in the subsequent reconstruction of a quantized analog signal. A concise proof is given for bounds on this error (either mean square or mean absolute value). This proof requires no assumptions regarding source distribution or number of quantization levels. If the code is orthogonal or transorthogonal, the bounds coincide with results obtained earlier by Clark and Totty for the case of 2N quantization levels, a natural binary code, and transmission through a binary symmetric channel."
"Manchester coded FSK uses two shifts per message bit. Assuming each shift is an incoherent RF pulse, we show that for small p2, the input signal-to-noise ratio, a quadratic receiver is optimum and has Pe=½(1+p2/4) exp(-p2/4). By comparison, incoherent FSK has Pe=½exp(-p2/4)."

The capabilities of communications satellites are presented both as currently existing and as envisioned in the future. The possibilities of using these capabilities in offshore communications systems are discussed especially with regard to the potential of new services brought about by the latest generation of satellites currently under production. Two potentially new types of services are hypothesized. Lastly, progress on the development of a small earth station of low cost suitable for such services is reported. It is concluded that communications satellites hold potential both currently and in the future for various offshore operations."

"Measurements of sea clutter using high-resolution radar show that clutter cross section is not Rayleigh distributed. Both the log-normal and contaminated-normal distributions are proposed and yield a fairly good description of some experimental data. Threshold values and detection curves are given for the mean and median detectors for both distributions. It is shown that the median is robust_that is, the threshold values and detection probabilities do not depend on the detailed shape of the clutter distribution but only on its median value."
"A distribution-free detection procedure for a multiplerange-bin radar is described. This procedure is based on the ranks of observations, but does not require elaborate equipment for rapidly ranking large amounts of data.

Comparisons with some \"best\" theoretical procedures are also given."
"Radar waves propagating through the turbulent troposphere acquire phase fluctuations which appear as aperture phase errors in synthetic-aperture radar systems. The phase error description follows directly from Tatarski's theory of wave propagation through turbulence; for most situations of interest, the phase error is Gaussian with stationary first increments. The structure function of the phase error is a function of the radar parameters and of the vertical profile Cnm(h) of the microwave refractive index structure constant of the turbulence. A closed form expression for best attainable resolution can then be given as a function of these same parameters, via the results of a phase error analysis by Brown and Riordan. Published data on Cnm(h) and its optical-region counterpart are reviewed. The data from a recent microwave propagation experiment by Thompson and Janes are then analyzed and are consistent with the order-of-magnitude estimates of Cnm: Some unsolved problems associated with applying the results to synthetic-aperture systems are discussed."
"An experimental study has been made of phase-front distortion in microwave signals sent over a slanted path. This distortion is important in systems involving phase measurements between a ground station and a moving upper terminal. To insure path stability, the upper terminal was simulated by a series of mountaintop antenna arrays. Phasefront distortion is analyzed in terms of time variations in radio range on a single path and in terms of first and second range differences between pairs of paths. The cross correslations of pairs of range and range difference records are discussed, and the strong dependence of correlation on fluctuation frequency is emphasized. Mountaintop terrain effects on the spatial homogeneity of the phase front are found to be insignificant. Some of the phase-front statistics are found to be weakly dependent on time of day and on wind velocity at the lower terminal."
"Resolution limits and corresponding optimum linear apertures are determined in the presence of phase errors. Let α(t) be the phase aberration at position t across the aperture; it is assumed that the random process α has a power law structure function, E{[(α(t)-α(τ)]2}= c|t-τ|n. Beam tilting caused by the phase error is \"removed\" (for each sample of α), then resolution formulas are developed. An approximate analysis is obtained in closed form and yields an optimum resolution proportional to c1/n for O < n < 2. The exact analysis is given for Gaussian α, and again the optimum resolution is proportional to c1/n. In applications n= 5/3 is of interest, and in the Gaussian case the best obtainable equivalent rectangle resolution is ρ λ)/2π (0.975)c3/5 radians with a corresponding optimum linear aperture of 14c-3/5. When long exposures are considered, imaging without removing beam tilting is of interest, and resolution is degraded by a factor of about 2.5 for a linear aperture. Alternatively, in some applications optimum focus as well as beam tilt should be considered, in this case resolution is improved by a factor of about 1.4 (again for n= 5/3). Finally, joint (tilt corrected) optimization over aperture length and taper is treated; however, as one might expect, the use of taper offers negligible resolution improvement."
"A new technique is described which provides for precision angle tracking of celestial radio sources with a conventional monopulse antenna receiving system. It is shown that this technique is readily adapted to angle tracking radars. The features of conventional monopulse operation are preserved while permitting precise angle tracking of noise sources when signal to noise ratios are much less than unity. Measurements, using a four-horn monopulse feed with a 28-foot parabolic reflector and a \"monopulse radiometer\" produced the characteristic monopulse angle detection functions when using the sun, the moon, and Cassiopeia A as boresight reference sources. Precision measurements were made to 8 arc second under varying weather conditions using 28-foot radio astronomy antennas. The accuracy of the measurements were limited by the antenna angle encoders, consequently no conclusions are drawn with regard to the absolute accuracy of the measurements. The celestial coordinates of four discrete radio sources and the equations for coordinate transformation to local elevation and azimuth are contained in the Appendixes."
"The radar cross section (RCS) characteristics of cavities are considered. Experimental data on simplified models obtained in 1966, but which heretofore have not received very wide dissemination, are reviewed and the results are compared with predictions based on a simplified (and semiempirical) theory for the end-on aspect case combined with a ray tracing procedure for other aspects. This theoretical method for estimation purposes is seen to provide quite adequate results."
"In the RCS analysis of jet aircraft, the engine intake and exhaust ducts present special problems which have not been widely discussed in the literature. In this paper an idealized example of a subsonic type of intake duct is chosen as an example for analysis. The idealization of the intake consists of a terminated circular waveguide, the termination being designed to represent the first stages of the jet engine. Examples of theoretical RCS and glint pztterns predicted with this model are given, showing the phenomenon of compressor modulation and the effects obtained with changes in wavelength and receiver-transmitter geometry."
"An accurate knowledge of the magnetic field distribution is of great importance in finding the best designs for electrical machinery. It is the purpose of this paper to present a new numerical method for the determination of three-dimensional flux distribution in the end zone of a highspeed aerospace homopolar alternator, and for the calculation of end leakage reactance. The new analysis is applied to an experimental 95 kVA, 115/200 V, 3400 Hz, 40 800 r/min, three-phase, wye-connected, homopolar alternator."
"This paper covers some important advances in understanding the problems associated with the VOR system, especially in connection with area navigation. Anomalies arising from airborne equipment, operating in the airborne environment, are described and analyzed. Factors contributing to overall system accuracy are treated with respect to VOR receiver response and to rate-limiting, filter means, with special attention to appropriate noise reduction systems providing zero or minimal time delay characteristics. The use of active filters in the VOR receiver is shown to be of major importance with regard to signal improvement and overall system accuracy. Active filters of the constant slew rate type have proved of significant value, both within the VOR receiver as well as in signal processing."
"Corrections of pointing data provided by gimbal readout transducers can be used to compensate for the errors that arise because of gimbal misalignments and inaccuracies in transducer readout. This paper reviews the sources of pointing error in precision gimbaled pointing systems and describes the techniques for determining them. In particular, a method of calibration that is suitable for systems in which constraints on gimbal travel preclude the use of conventional calibration procedures is presented, and the pointing readout accuracy that can be achieved by this method is evaluated."
"A recent paper1 discusses certain aspects of strapdown attitude error sources. It is pointed out here that the long term effects of these and several additional sources have previously been determined, within the framework of a complete attitude reference [4] and navigation [5] system."
"A pulse compression matched filter is analyzed so that the response may be computed when the pulse width, FM rate, and center frequency simultaneously differ from design conditions. Unilateral and bilateral time domain amplitude weighting for sidelobe reduction is included. A general cross-ambiguity function is defined to include these effects and some basic computed results are presented for the peak envelope response with various degrees of Hamming weighting. Computer evaluation of this cross-ambiguity function allows one to choose a combination of mismatches for signal design trade-off between resolution and detection performance. Since no restrictions are placed upon the mismatch parameters, this analysis may also be used to evaluate the filter discrimination against various interfering signals."
"If accurate first-order corrections for ionospheric delay are applied to VHF ranging signals, the second-order terms become dominant. Only with abnormally large values of ionospheric electron content do the second-order terms lead to serious errors, however. Since these terms can be estimated to within 10 percent, further correction can lead to very small position errors."
"The autocorrelation and power spectrum of spurii arising from periodic random phase injections into a coherent backscatter signal are found. Design considerations of appropriate filters to eliminate spurii noise is discussed."
"This correspondence describes a unique digital Doppler ambiguity resolution technique for a pulsed S-band radar. Whereas conventional methods of resolving ambiguities employ various curve fitting schemes in which the best differentiated range curve fit is compared with the Doppler derived velocity, the method described here uses the opposite approach, i.e., the Doppler derived velocity is integrated and compared with the range change over the integrating interval. The integrating approach offers the following advantages over conventional curve fitting. 1) There are no lag errors due to velocity changes, other than tracker lag induced by jerk. 2) No large storage of past data points and their weighting Constants must be implemented."
"The equations derived by A. J. Rainal for the probability density function of the angle error output of a monopulse radar excited by a Gaussian signal and Gaussian thermal noise are generalized to include the presence of multiple targets. The examples given demonstrate the radar's behavior for various combinations of target and noise parameters."

 "General requirements and concepts for the 1975 space station information management problem are sized parametrically. Because of the need for feasible distribution of data to space and ground users over long-term flight conditions, emphasis has been placed on the preliminary concepts for onboard data processing and autonomous information handling combined with only single-point ground distribution. The requirements for such extensive critical data-distribution capabilities have been established from preliminary estimates."
"This paper is concerned with a high-performance nutation damper for use in dual-spin spacecraft. The damper described here makes use of a wheel of uniform mass distribution. The wheel experiences torques which are produced by inertial forces. Damping and restoring (spring) torques are provided by means of a torsional arrangement built around the center of the wheel. The performance characteristics of the above nutation damper are evaluated by considering the small astronomy satellite (SAS-A) spacecraft parameters, and the results for an optimum design of the damper are presented. Finally, the result for the optimum performance is checked with the help of an approximate analysis."
"The propagation errors caused by the atmosphere are investigated in order to find out the causes of the observed errors in range and range-rate measurements between a ground station and an artificial satellite. The calculations show that the observed errors are mostly caused by the measuring instruments. The propagation errors are mainly caused by increases, decreases, or fluctuations of the refractive index of the atmosphere, and the errors caused by the refraction of the propagation path are about 10 percent of the errors caused by the decrease of the propagation velocity. The tropospheric range errors are less than 150 meters and are approximately expressed by a cotangent function, and they are reduced by about 90 percent through the use of monthly average refractivity profiles of the troposphere. The ionospheric errors are usually negligible at centimeter radio waves (less than 10 cm), and even at decimeter waves or meter waves almost all errors can be removed by the use of two different frequencies on the down-link so that the range can be made independent of frequency."
"A position fix in a passive mode using satellites usually necessitates an expensive computer or lengthy hand calculation. This is the largest drawback of passive navigation and it would be more desirable if the user could find his position by a mere glance at a chart and table, as one uses Loran. The first step toward this goal is to use a synchronous satellite because it simplifies the problem. The next step is to find the position of the user by a Loran type of chart, which is universal, and correct this apparent position by looking at a special table which is made according to the amount of perturbation of both the satellite and the user's position. An example of the position fix along the route between Yokohama to Hawaii is shown. The concept can be extended to orbiting satellites due to the rules which govern the motion of satellites, if the fix accuracy is in the order of 2 to 5 miles. This method should be more accurate than the common sextant and more practical due to the fact that the satellite can be used at any time and in any weather. As a total system, it will be better than Omega because it could provide additional navigation information such as communication or traffic control by using satellites."
"The paper presents a method by which the zeros of the polynomial representing a Huffman (impulse-equivalent) pulse sequence can be chosen so as to exert a degree of control on the form of the energy distribution of the signal in the time-frequency plane. This makes it possible to design Huffman pulse sequences which are suitable for use as radar or sonar signals in situations where significant target velocity occurs."
"The theoretical and experimental work performed since 1960 in the area of high-intensity and high-temperature operation of silicon and gallium arsenide photovoltaic devices is reviewed. Test results for conventional 5-grid silicon cells, for specially designed 13-grid silicon cells, and for a GaAs cell are presented parametrically for the illumination intensity range from 0.07 to 2.8 W/cm2 and the temperature range from 30 to 1 50°C. The data cover the 3 points on the currentvoltage characteristic required to reconstruct the full characteristic in the power-generating quadrant. The 13-grid silicon cells showed much better performance than the GaAs cell."
"The modern digital computer is rapidly permeating all areas of our highly industrialized society-from agriculture to education-from process control to zoology. Printing and publishing and allied fields involved in graphic communications have been changing rapidly in this decade as the digital computer and associated peripheral devices have made rapid inroads in the graphic communications process. This paper describes the nature of the impact which the digital computer has had, and is making, upon today's graphic communications, particularly upon the editing and composition functions. A prediction of future impact is also presented."
"A simple new coding scheme has been developed which increases the transmission efficiency for graphics by a factor of 2, or what amounts to the same, can transmit two documents over the initial channel used to transmit a single picture, while preserving the subjective picture quality. Based on the exploration of polyominoes, the initial message is submitted to a well-defined information extraction process at the transmitter and a corresponding reconstruction manipulation for message display at the receiver."
"In this paper discrete likelihood ratio computational algorithms resulting from recent studies in detection theory are applied to the general radar detection problem in which it is desired to detect the presence or absence of a sinusoidal pulse with unknown time of arrival, frequency, and phase. The resulting optimum digital receiver structure isdetermined and computer simulation results presented."
"Theoretical analyses are made to determine expected relative values of average radar cross section for idealized scatterers above the sea. Horizontal, vertical, and circular polarizations are considered along with various sea states and radar depression angles. The results are considered to be useful for providing insight into effects of the sea on the polarization dependence of rain return. Effects of the earth's curvature and atmospheric refraction are neglected."
"This paper describes the design of the millimeter wave experiment aboard the ATS-5 satellite. This equipment is the first millimeter wave communications equipment in space. The function of the equipment is to provide earthspace propagation data at Ku- and Ka- band frequencies. The designs of the phase locked Ka- band receiver, the Ku-band transmitter, the antennas, and the telemetry and processing equipment are described. Mechanical and environmental problems are also discussed."
"Coherent optical systems, because of their basic similarity to coherent radar systems, can be used to simulate many of the characteristics of the latter. This paper discusses the use of a coherent optical system for the simulation of the range and azimuth ambiguities that sometimes occur in radar systems. The optical configurations for implementing these simulations are described in detail, and extensive experimental results are presented."
"The Doppler frequency shift, and spectral spread, of the radar scattering return from turbulent underdense ionized wakes are explicitly related here to the wake mean velocity, and to the wake turbulent velocity fluctuations and mean velocity gradients, respectively, via spectral moments of the matched-filter receiver response."
"An improvement in high altitude communication with a small, rocket-borne sonde can be achieved by transmitting circularly polarized waves. Signal losses due to cross polarization of linear antennas can be reduced. Measured radiation patterns for instrument mounted linear and several helical antennas are presented. Flight data are discussed."
 "The output response of a matched filter for several cases of combined Barker codes is computed for various amounts of Doppler mismatch. It is shown that combined Barker codes, like conventional Barker codes, are extremely sensitive to Doppler shift."
"The availability and ease of programming for many computer aided design (CAD) languages permits their use where, formerly, bread boarding or analytical means would have been employed to solve specific circuit analysis problems. One of many available CAD languages is the electronic circuit analysis program (ECAP). The ECAP language is divided into three sections, dc-analysis. acanalysis, and transient analysis. The three modes of ECAP together with fast computer access provide a helpful tool for the design engineer. Following is a typical problem of oscillatory transients encountered in line-type modulators. The solution to the problem is a model of sufficient correlation with the observed oscillation as an aid to find a network which will critically damp the oscillation."
"A position determination technique for balloons floating in the Venusian atmosphere is described. Measurements are all made using a single station of the NASA Deep Space Network. One coordinate of the fix is derived from a ranging measurement, and the other coordinate is derived from observation on earth of the polarization of a signal radiated from a linearly polarized antenna on the balloon, aligned to vertical by balloon local gravity."
 "This paper was presented at the G-AES Luncheon, NAECON 1970, Dayton, Ohio, May 19, 1970, where Mr. Hansel received the 1970 Pioneer Award (see page 721 of the September 1970 issue of this TRANSACTIONS). The author offers some personal obserivations on the challenge of compatibility in systems planninig with special reference to civil aviation He discusses VOR accuracy and RF spectrum utilization as typical compatibility problems and also as particularly timely and important challenges to planners who seek compatible evolution toward higher performance goals and efficient use of an important and limited natural resource. He notes several lessons to be learned about the challenge of compatibility in systems planning. 1) Major improvements of mature systems can be accomplished with minimum compatibility impact only if we plan and act boldly and early and with a long range perspective. 2) Many years are required to implement a major change in the fixed plant portion of a large system. This gives us time to introduce design changes in newly manufactured subscriber equipments long before any practicable deadline for full system implementation. By deadline time the relatively few older unchanged subscriber equipments still in service will be a minor fraction of the total in service. These remaining older equipments can then either be used without benefit of higher performance, or can be retrofitted or replaced at a cost which is an acceptable price for essential progress. 3) We have an often unrecognized obligation to the future as we plan both new systems and improvements and extensions of existing systems. This is the obligation to plan, from the outset, for progressive evolutionary compatibility, not only with existing equipments, but also with future performance requirements and with efficient use of the RF spectrum. 4) Near term compatibility requirements need not be and must not be permitted to become a deadening and stagnating constraint on future progress."

   "Plug stopping a low-inertia squirrel-cage induction motor can provide a very quick stop, but the motor draws high peak currents from the power system and delivers high transient torques to the driven machinery. This engineering phenomena is well documented, yet the potential pitfalls of plugging applications are often not appreciated. The induction motor is so widely used in industry that a review of its plugging characteristics may be useful."
"The literature has documented well the characteristics of many different types of inverter circuits. One such circuit is described in detail. A brief theory of operation is given, together with the reasons for choosing this particular circuit and some of the advantages and disadvantages accruing to its use. Finally, a number of optional features will be described which are available to allow the customer to \"tailor\" a basic inverter to his particular application."
"This paper is a first draft of Chapter XI of a proposed publication on preferred practice in system protection and coordination being developed by the Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Committee of the IGA Group. It presents ideas on the application of protective equipment to industrial and commercial power system buses and switchgear."
"The induction heating industry has recently introduced a new high-frequency power source, the static frequency converter. The converter uses solid-state low-loss thyristors to guide currents to the induction heating load generating high-frequency power at high efficiency. Unlike the conventional motor generator, the output frequency of the static converter is variable, being self-controlled from the induction heating load. It follows the load impedance and adjusts itself to maintain preset conditions. This paper describes to the potential induction heating user what a static converter is, how it works, and how it compares with its more familiar counterpart, the motor-generator."
"A power frequency plasma torch is described specifically designed for application to industrial heating processes using a magnetically rotated radial arc for which efficiency and reliability were considered to be the main criteria. Operation at moderate supply voltage with a high overall circuit power factor is obtained by using a separate ignition supply for reigniting the arc at each half-cycle. The design is based on a wide range of preliminary investigations many of which may be applied to both ac and dc plasma torches or other arc operated devices. The operating characteristics of the plasma torch are given, and a thermal balance has been carried out enabling the efficiency to be accurately measured. An efficiency greater than 60 percent has been measured in this way."
"A system is described that provides accurate contact surface-temperature measurement that is free from conduction error and heat perturbation of the measured surface. The principle is one of null heat flow provided by an electronically servoed backup heater. The probe consists of three basic parts: a measuring contact thermocouple, a differential thermocouple, and a heater, mounted in tandem. The measuring junction and one junction of the differential couple contact the surface. The second differential junction is located a short distance behind the first junction so as to have a thermal path between the junctions. The backup heater is located behind the second junction. When the probe contacts a surface that is above probe temperature, the first differential junction rises in temperature above the second junction, producing an EMF which is fed into the electronic servo. This signal is amplified, and quickly energizes the electric backup heater by the amount required to reduce and maintain the differential signal at zero. Under this condition, there is no heat exchange between the probe and the surface; the measuring junction is at the surface temperature. Present temperature capability extends from ambient to approximately 2250°F. Future designs are expected to extend the upper limit to about 3000°F."
"Large single-phase motors (15-50 hp) have been developed. These are capacitor start-capacitor run squirrel-cage induction motors. They are designed with very low inrush current and have low starting torque. Breakdown torque and full-load (FL) performance are normal for single-phase motors. These motors are specifically designed for crop dryer fans, irrigation pumps, forage blowers, liquid manure pumps, any application where low starting torque (50-percent FL) is sufficient."
"Control of first-order thermal plants with inherent time lags by means of hystereitc ON-OFF controllers is investigated. Open-loop pulse-duration-modulation control of the same class of plants is briefly analyzed. A scheme is investigated where the plant is controlled on an open-loop basis by a controller which is included in a feedback loop containing a model of the plant. The parameters of the model can deliberately be made different than those of the process. By a suitable choice of these model parameters better performance criteria can be obtained, especially when they exist due to the distributed nature of thermal processes and to the location of temperature sensing units."
"An important class of fluidized beds has been investigated, those that are indirectly heated by electrical elements inserted in the fluid flow before the bed. They are commonly used for drying, chemical synthesis, mixing, coating, and similar industrial processes. New models have been developed that are simple to manipulate and are determined by tests at only three flow rates. These models have a high degree of accuracy in the initial treatment region that is of importance in control studies."
"This paper presents a method of treating tubular heating elements operating below 550°F so as to minimize the effect of moisture on the impedance between the sheath and the heater wire of the elemnent."
"Integral horsepower motors from 1 to 30 hp are becoming more common on fanns for large feeding, crop drying, and irrigation systems [1]. Multiple-motor loads of 20 to 65 hp or more are being operated on single-phase power [2], [3]. As large motor loads on rural systems become more numerous, the problems associated with their use need more attention."
"The already high ratio of investment to income in rural areas is a big problem. But, the additional investment in selective underground rural distribution (URD) primary is justified where exposure to tree and storm expense is indicated. A bonus result will be found in improved service. The engineer must be ready to substitute insulated overhead construction where unusually difficult soil conditions exist' Savings in operating costs associated with ground installed secondaries, services and transformers, however, are not sufficient to warrant their installation in rural areas. However, URD, wisely applied, is a distinct improvement; economically, URD is worth the additional cost of initial installation when reasonably applied; and we cannot afford to be without a sound underground program, even in our most uneconomical service areas."
"The heating mechanism in a microwave oven results from the interaction of a high-frequency electromagnetic field and the food within it. In most ovens the field is generated by a magnetron which converts dc energy to high-frequency energy at approximately 2450 MHz. This energy is then propagated into the oven chamber which is, in reality, a multimode resonant cavity where the energy is reflected from the walls to create standing wave patterns. To properly design a microwave oven, one must consider not only the magnetron but also the dimensions and resonant properties of the oven cavity. The designer must strive for a uniform energy density within the cavity for uniform cooking of the food and must be sure the cavity presents the proper load to the magnetron. These objectives are discussed, and a procedure for obtaining them is outlined."
"The custom dispenser is an electromechanical system for automatically delivering ice cubes or chilled water through the door of a domestic refrigerator into the user's glass at the touch of a button. This revolutionary product feature is the result of the efforts of many people rather than the idea of one individual."
"This paper presents a simplified method for absolute determination of the perfornance correction for air density variations in a convenient ready to use form. It was developed through the use of computer analysis of data for 14 widely differing vacuum cleaner motors. By acknowledging that a 1-percent error in the vacuum correction factor was acceptable, a single curve was developed. A wattage correction factor curve was also developed. Because of the variance in efficiencies between motors, however, this curve has an error range of 4 5 percent. The curves were then verified experimentally by more than 1000 tests taken in environmental and altitude chambers in the ambient range from 50 to 100°F and 24 to 30 inches of mercury barometric pressure."
"Because of their inherent accuracy and dependability, direct digital controls now find a wide assortment of applications in industry. Their modular nature and simplicity of function make them adaptable in a variety of permutations to an extensive variety of problems. The fundamentals of these digital control systems and how they can be applied in general and specifically in the rubber and plastics industry are discussed."

 "Useful heat for bonding of plastics and organics can be generated by induction hysteresis heating of iron oxide particles at megahertz frequencies. The heat is generated even though the particles are only micron size and electrically insulated from one another in a plastic carrier. The principles and applications of this process differ from other induction methods in that the heat-generating material can be applied as either a solid or a liquid, a flexible bond is achieved, and nonplastic nonmetals can be bonded. Numerous advantages are achieved because the heat is generated directly at and only at the joint interface with no need for heat transfer. Many applications are feasible for heat sealing, bonding, accelerated drying, and other heat-dependent processes applied to wood, paper, plastics, leather, corrugated board, rubber, fabrics, or essentially any electrical nonconductor that can be heat sealed or adhesively bonded. Special coil designs have been developed to help provide the desired intense fields at the typical operating frequency such as 4 MHz."
"This paper discusses the new NEMA suggested standards for future design of ac integral horsepower motors, 1-200 hp where the horsepower ratings have been increased for frame sizes, and compares them with the standards (T versus U frames). Design changes necessary to meet the new standards are indicated."
"The special features of the Duocentric motor are compared with conventional polyphase motors, and typical applications are described."
"A review of basic ac induction motor characteristics establishes the requirements of a static ac variable-speed drive. Both voltage and frequency impressed onto an ac motor must be programmed in correct proportion if required operating torque is to be maintained. The means of voltage control used characterizes the various inverter designs and likewise dictates their limitations. Pulsewidth modulation for variable voltage control eliminates many of the restrictions heretofore placed on inverters. Their operating capabilities, while not economically favorable in every case, are technically equal to or better than those of a dc system."

"A new and improved system of distribution pole-top construction has been introduced under the name of Thortec. Without the use of an overhead shield wire, it provides lightning protection comparable to fully shielded construction, in addition to high immunity to the effect of lightning strokes terminating on objects adjacent to the line. Thortec is extremely effective in combating aerial contamination and has proved its ability to maintain continuity of service in areas heretofore subject to high outage frequency. This new system is free from interruptions caused by accidental contact of birds or climbing animals. Symmetrical, compact design lends attractive appearance to Thortec lines and permits their use, as opposed to more costly underground construction, in many areas where aesthetic values are highly stressed."
"This paper describes the novel open-wye-type phase conversion system which operates three-phase motors on single-phase power. The system is initially depicted in its most basic circuit, with more sophisticated circuits presented as the paper progresses. Circuit voltages and currents are outlined for the basic system. Also presented is the increment (part winding) starting circuit used for large motors, such as a 100-hp 1200-r/min motor driving a rock crusher, operating on single-phase power."
"There has been limited lighting on the farms in the past due to the absence of good lighting recommendations. Recently, the joint ASAE-IES Farm Lighting Committee issued a report which provides authoritative lighting recommendations. By following the general procedure outlined in this paper, a lighting plan for a farmstead can be developed which will provide the levels of illumination recommended in the ASAE-IES report. Adequate outdoor lighting as recommended can provide many benefits to the farmer such as improved security, reduction of accidents, and increased productivity."
"The development of something wholly new in the infrared heating field is very unlikely, since the field has been studied by researchers and development engineers for over two decades. When a new and promising application is developed, even though new in application only and not in concept, a great deal of enthusiasm is generated by the personnel involved. This paper discusses the development of the silicon carbide radiant infrared heating module, the problems incurred in various facets of its design, and its application in industry."
"Arcing ground-fault theories and general history are reviewed and some of the available methods of ground-fault protection on low-voltage systems discussed. The cost of compansons of various methods in common use today are made. An economical ground-fault protective device integral with the solid-state trip device on 600-volt drawout air circuit breakers is presented in detail and the typical coordination and protection possible is illustrated by curves. Thus the ground-fault problem can be overcome and in some cases at only a nominal increase in cost."
"The use of electrical energy as a quantity and the rate of consumption of this energy as a demand rate have often been discussed in terms of horsepower for a given machine in the rubber industry. However, within the past 30 years, there has been no effort to consolidate these data as a measure of the complete process."
"The rubber industry is directing a great deal of attention to the possibilities of improvements in process control of their cure rooms. Due to governmental regulations, it is becoming increasingly important to control more precisely the curing processes to maintain production schedules and a level of quality demanded by today's market."
"This paper describes a new drive tool for the rubber and plastics industries that will save money on operating and initial costs, and provide the reliable service of a squirrel-cage induction motor. The pole amplitude modulation (PAM) motor is a two-speed single-stator-winding induction motor that is ideally suited to many drives, such as mixer drives, pump and fan drives-in fact, any drive where there is an advantage to have a choice of operating speeds. The paper is divided into two main parts. Firstly, some specific applications and the advantages of using PAM motors are discussed; secondly, the theoretical and operating aspects of pole amplitude modulation are explained."
"This paper deals with the design of a digital biaxial contouring control system for a lathe, constructed at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. The system is capable of simultaneous application to both feed and crossfeed by means of an interpolator (in this case a DDA computer). It comprises a speed-control loop governed by the interpolator, and an incremental position-control loop. The biaxial motion may be linear, circular, or combined. The position and speed signals for each step are fed to the system from a command panel comprising a socket matrix with plugs used for \"writing.\" As soon as a given command has been implemented, the system automatically passes on to the next. Transition from step to step is effected through a counter whose output contains a decoding network. The decoder outputs are connected to the command panel, which is scanned row by row. The axis position is measured by means of rotating encoder emitting 1000 pulses per revolution, of which 125 are utilized in ordinary operation. The required accuracy is 1 pulse, equivalent to 0.01 mm."

 "Redundancy is a consideration in modem design practice for electrical power systems that has in recent years become much more a definite requirement. Certain systems used in the design of power supplies for large industrial, commercial, and institutional types of projects and the economical aspects of these systems are defined."
"A correlation is made between serum protein electrophoresis behavior on various cellulosic media and the electrical parameters eliciting the observed behavior. In a standard electrophoresis procedure for human serum employing 1-by 6-inch strips of a cellulose acetate support medium, a tris-barbital buffer having an ionic strength of 0.05 for the combined molarity of its ionizable salts is employed at a constant 250 volts over a period of 45 minutes at ambient temperature (about 26°C). The natures of several polymer support media are correlated with buffer strengths, current densities, and separation times. Variances in electrical operating factors, such as resistivity and heat production, are compared to standard results obtained on a control cellulose acetate membrane. The effects of polymeric structural differences are defined in terms of the adjustments in the standard electrical operating conditions that are necessary to yield control-quality electrophoretic separation. Protein separation characteristics are discussed in terms of the theory involved, the results obtained, and the clinical significances of the findings."
"A strong foundation for the successful implementation of a process control computer system is the result of careful and thorough planning of all physical equipment in the early stages of the project. This was accomplished during installation of the existing float glass process control systems at both the Nashville and Dearborn glass plants of Ford Motor Company."
"Making glass-to-metal seals using RF is actually quite easy, albeit empirical. Preliminary lab work to determine the approximate equipment requirements is both necessary and desirable. This can and should be done at the equipment manufacturer's lab. Choice of metal mass is critical so as to provide a sufficient heat sink. Metal part configuration also affects the interface heat transfer to the glass and, therefore, the glass flow or wetting. Properly done, capillary flow and fillet formation will prevent undesirable reentrant seal shapes with resultant undesirable stress concentrations. Ordinarily, metal chosen should possess physical characteristics (such as coefficient of expansion) which closely match the glass to be used. Cleaning procedures prior to preoxidieing of the metal transcend customary \"routine\" cleaning and so are very fussy, as is the oxidizing. Sealmet no. 4, 430-TI, and Kovar are the three most widely used metals in the electronics glass field. The induction heating (RF) process also lends itself to creation (cutting) of holes in glass prior to final terminal insertion. The holes can be used in their own right (as holes only) so long as cutting is followed by light glazing and stress relief (annealing) of the glass. Provision must exist to control and vary time and power input within reasonable limits in order to finally arrive at a condition of process control which will satisfy the needs of the end product."
"The process of expanding, modernizing, or rehabilitating an electrical power system involves procedures and techniques supplementing those required for new designs. The problems in large buildings and the aspect of the service equipment and main breakers or switches are considered. Several examples of typical expansion, rehabilitation, and modernization are presented."
"The history leading up to the current rules for conduit fill limits in the 1968 National Electrical Code is presented. The current limits for new work and rewiring are reviewed and recommendations made as to what the fill limits should be for industrial plant and commercial building wiring."
"Solid-state electronic instruments have been applied to the glass forehearth, where precise measurement and control of glass temperature are needed to ensure adequate gob weight control for extended periods. Comparative experiments between forehearth systems show that a 3:1 temperature control improvement can be achieved by updating conventional control systems. Front-zone temperature deviation can be used to predict a related weight deviation according to the equation ΔWT = 0.58 ΔT where ΔT is in degrees Fahrenheit and ΔWT is in percent. This model is applied in the analysis of a typical forehearth temperature versus weight control relationship."
"A wound rotor induction machine, actuated by two magnetic fields rotating with a speed differential in a common magnetic circuit, is considered. Continuous machine speed regulation is realized by feeding both stator windings from a variac, each obtaining a fraction of the supply voltage. An equivalent diagram and the torque equation are given, and experimental results are presented."
"Economic and efficient two-speed single-winding single-phase motors of any pole ratio are shown possible using normal coils with only eight terminals taken out from the winding. The rotor is of conventional squirrel-cage type. The new two-speed motors are characterized by good independent starting and running performances at both the speeds. The design is based on a novel theory known as the total pole-amplitude modulation method and is described in full."
"A fundamental characteristic of the salient-pole synchronous motor is a twice-slip frequency torque pulsation during acceleration. Although frequently neglected, sound application engineering requires an understanding of this subject. The way twice-slip frequency torques are produced in synchronous machines is discussed, as are the effects of these torques on mechanical system considerations such as critical speeds and stress buildup in shafts. Finally, specific areas of design coordination between designers of electrical power systems, synchronous motors, and the mechanical components of the system are suggested."
"Until recently motor reclosing problems were thought to be strictly academic exercises. With the testing that has been going on in the motor manufacturing industry and in the utility industry. this problem manifets itself as a real one and one that must be considered during system design. There is mounting evidence to support the fact that reclosing out of phase has damaged many a motor. This damage was usually thought to have been caused by operator error or poor design."
"The application of relays for the protection of large motors is complicated by widely varying motor designs. For this reason, there are many schemes and varying degrees of protection in successful service. Our paper is restricted to squirrelcage induction motors applied at unattended pipe-line substations."
"The objections of the water works industry to the use of water system piping for electrical grounding purposes, and the latest revision of the American Water Works Association policy on grounding are discussed. Electrical engineers engaged in design of grounding protection are alerted to the need for development of new, independent, and reliable grounding techniques."
"An experimental study was made to compare the efficacy of concrete encased grounding electrodes to that of driven ground rods for grounding residential and small commercial electric services. This study extended over 14 months and included a very wet winter and a dry summer. The ground resistances of both grounding systems were monitored for the first 5 months. Current from an isolated 120/240-volt system was then circulated through both grounding systems for the following 6 months. At the end of the 14-month period, fault current from power systems of 2.4 to 20 kV were applied to both grounding systems. The ground resistance variations were recorded in all cases."
"Problems of operating unattended three-phase load systems on rural electric power systems are considered. Emphasis is placed on special fault patterns frequently not detected by simple sensing techniques. Improperly designed or inadequate sensing equipment will permit faulty commercial power to remain counected to the load equipment until catastrophic damage has occurred."
"Charge generation rates have been measured for two halocarbons and their mixtures, having electrical conductivities ranging from 7.5 ×10-12 to 2 ×10-15 Ω-1 ·cm-1. These fluids were passed through a 1.55-mm diameter tube as a liquid and as a mist at high velocity at ambient temperatures. Due to the high vapor pressures of the materials, a closed system capable of operating at pressures up to 30 atmospheres was utilized."

"An interim report of Working Group IV of the Petroleum and Chemical Industry Committee (PCIC) is presented. A review of the group's assignment, the basic plan for achieving its goals, and comments from a survey which sought to find general problems related to enclosures for hazardous areas is included."
"A series of tables comparing the standards of about 40 countries for the requirements for electrical enclosures is presented. In different countries, areas are classified in various ways leading to different types of enclosures. Dimensional data and test requirements change from country to country. These comparisons of standards help to show the real need to review and revise the National Electrical Code and Standards for electrical enclosures."
"Difficulties in obtaining approved equipment for use in designing electrical systems for hazardous locations, as well as types of equipment modification or installation sometimes utilized when approved equipment is not available, are discussed. Applications are referenced to particular sections of the National Electrical Code. The authors recommend that approvals of the various testing agencies be reciprocal where possible, and furthermore that standard tests or a set of testing standards be established so that professional testing laboratories could perform many of the tests."
"Reliable operation of on-line computers requires an uninterruptible source of electric power; some computers are sensitive to power interruptions as short as one half-cycle of line frequency. Two static-type uninterruptible power systems that have been purchased by the Federal Aviation Administration for installation at air route traffic control centers are described. One, built by the General Electric Company, represents commercial design and construction; the second, built by the Garrett Corporation, represents design and construction to comply with the Federal Aviation Administration specification prepared for uninterruptible power system equipment."
"The findings of Ufer that concrete-encased metal objects were effective in providing improved grounding under adverse soil conditions suggests that the reinforcing framework of footings for the columns of structural steel buildings would provide effective grounding function and means. Ensuing tests in high, medium, and low resistivity soils indicate that the grounding capability of such reinforced foctings (per unit) is equivalent to that of conventional electrodes under low and medium soil resistivity conditions and superior to them under high soil resistivity conditions. In addition, the much larger number of column footings required for structural reasons does, when used, provide much more effective grounding under all soil conditions than previously used systems. The steel framework of such buildings, if electrically connected at each column base to an inherent grounding electrode, then functions as a very efficient grounding network for system, lightning, and static grounding. Fault grounding should always employ a return conductor following the routing of the faulted conductor. The use of new types of grounding electrodes is becoming obligatory due to the widening unsuitability of water pipe systems for grounding purposes. This unsuitability is due to the use of nonconducting joints in the water piping and to the use of nonconducting piping for the water system."
"Cycloconverter-type commutatorless motors having shunt and series characteristics are treated. Though their principle of performance is almost the same as that of a polyphase separately excited inverter, there is commutation due to source voltage at the ac power source which does not exist with a polyphase separately excited inverter. Theoretical equations for rotational speed of the shunt-type and the series-type motors are derived, and it is shown that these characteristics are the same as for dc machines. Factors affecting commutation due to induced EMF, which is a key point in this type of commutatorless motor, are overlapping angle and armature reaction. In summary, for the shunt type these two increase as load current increases until commutation failure occurs. On the other hand, for the series type these two are independent of load current if the iron does not saturate. So the commutation failure cannot occur with the series type. These phenomena are treated in detail theoretically, and are proven by measuring the effective controlling angle γ by means of new methods. Other basic characteristics are shown theoretically and experimentally."
"It is the problem of the inverter designer to design a unit whose cost is low and whose reliability is high, consistent with all other application requirements. This suggests that a minimum of major switching elements be used, that conservatively rated components be employed, and that circuit redundancy be incorporated in the design. Another major problem facing the inverter designer is that of maintaining the output voltage of the inverter within an allowable band of values. This problem arises due to the normal voltage drops within the inverter. It also is aggravated by the voltage drops in the rectifier supplying power to the inverter or by the battery voltage variation. Multiple pulse modulation provides more than one polarity reversal per half-cycle. The amplitude of the input voltage to the inverter is equal to that of the source and is essentially fixed for small intervals of time. The freedom to reverse polarity is the freedom to change the harmonic structure of the output. By selecting the number and location of the reversals in polarity, the fundamental amplitude may be varied while eliminating low-order harmonics. This technique offers a unique utilization of power handling components."
"The trend in the field of silicon rectifier plants is, for economic reasons mainly, toward ever increasing current ratings. As preferred construction for high-current units the compact type has emerged. The principle of cooling the rectifiers with deionized water already favorably applied is described in detail. Special design features necessitated by strong magnetic fields are pointed out. A description of existing plants and a report on operating experience are given."
"Electric power consumption for economic studies of oil-producing operations is generally overestimated by 30 to 70 percent. Methods for making more accurate estimates are given, and test data that will be helpful when detailed information is not available are provided. A general discussion of making power cost estimates is followed by specific discussions of beam pumping units, submergible pumps, water injection pumps, and long-term projections for combined operations."
"The float glass process at Ford is a continuous process running 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. Like most of the continuous processes, it is pretty well automated and operates continuously, with manual intervention on exceptions basis. It consists of three major areas using three different types of automatic control equipment. The first section is called \"batch house,\" in which predetermined amounts of raw materials are weighed, mixed, and conveyed to the second step. The control logic here is all prewired and uses relays and stepping switches. The second stage is melting and forming where the batch is converted into molten glass and finally into a flat ribbon of float glass. The control system for this portion is a real-time process control computer using direct-digital control philosophy for control. The third stage is cutting and unloading of brackets. This system is driven by a General Electric hard-wired numerical-control cutting machine using transistor technology and hydraulic as well as electric power to drive the equipment. Thus Ford has automated its float process using all three generations of control equipment."
"Most static power converters are nonlinear systems which produce undesired harmonics in the three-phase input lines of the supply power system. These harnonics cause distorted voltage waveforms and must be reduced specially in large power applications. The methods of reducing undesired hannonics with special emphasis on designing input filters to reduce the undesired harmonics are discussed. The design of the input filters in general affects the performance of the converter. These effects are discussed for a single-phase voltage controller with an input filter."
"The control circuit necessary for the operation of an automatic elevator which starts and stops at specified places and at specified time is presented. At present the elevator operations are generally controlled by electromechanical relays with a large number of contacts and limit switches. Here it has been tried to dispense with relays and their contacts, limit switches etc., by the introduction of semiconductor logical and switching devices. Electronic counting technique has also been suitably used. Different logical and switching schemes to be used have been developed by writing all the logical and sequential operations in the form of constraint equations, then solving them with the help of Boolean algebra. Boolean operations are performed by different logical and switching circuits. The entire control circuit has been constructed and tested, and the results were found to be in conformity with the predicted operations. All the facilities provided in an operatorless automatic elevator are also provided by this static control circuit. It is not, however, claimed that this is the only static control circuit possible or that the circuitry used is optimum. The authors only feel that such an approach will help the elevator engineers in finding out the easiest solution to any elevator operation problem. This is surely not possible by looking at different operations as completely isolated and their circuit arrangements mutually independent."

 "A quantitative reliability and availability comparison has been made of three common circuit arrangements used in industrial power distribution systems. This includes a simple radial system, a primary-selective system, and a secondary-selective system. Published failure rates and outage duration times were used for the reliability data of the electrical equipment. Probability of failure and statistical analysis were used in making the quantitative calculations of the reliability and availability of the three power distribution systems. The simple radial system analyzed had an average forced hours downtime per year that was between 5.9 to 9.0 times larger than a secondary-selective system. The importance of two separate power supply sources from the electric utility has been identified and analyzed. This paper contains an approach that could be used to assist in cost-reliability tradeoff decisions in the design of the power distribution system."
"A brief review of the history of Underwriters' Laboratories in the electrical field is presented, including the reasons and importance for its existence, how standards are developed and submittals are handled, and what factory follow-up services means to the manufacturer and the user under the new advance program concept. There is special emphasis on the progress in the development of requirements for and the recognition of high-interrupting capacity overcurrent devices, as well as related power control equipment, including switches, industrial control devices, busways, and related assemblies, such as panelboards and switchboards."

Items discussed include intemational standards, test procedures, modifications, special acceptance procedures, and new programs."
"The necessity of employing special electrical equipment in hazardous areas where gases, vapors, and dusts of an explosive nature are handled or encountered is explored. Tests conducted on such equipment to demonstrate that it can be operated safely in such hazardous areas are described. The general procedure for submitting the equipment to Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc., for the investigations is described as well as the follow-up service conducted at the manufacturer's plant on the production devices. Some of the questions which arise with respect to possible self-certification by a manufacturer are also discussed."
"The fundamentals of induction heating, the basic heater design, its heating capabilities and characteristics, the power system, and a general arrangement of heaters designed to feed a large hot strip mill will be discussed."
"Harmonic analysis of direct ac-to-ac frequency converters has been discussed in a few publications. A method of applying Fourier analysis and Boolean techniques to predict the harmonic content of the input and output currents of cycloconverters is described. The method is used to analyze an idealized threephase to single-phase frequency converter whose output frequency fo is a multiple or nonmultiple of the input frequency fi. The results obtained by this method are essential for the design of input filters and in determining amplitudes of subharmonics and beat frequencies with various cycloconverters."
"High-voltage power fuses today include improvements in their performance characteristics that are virtually as impressive as the rapidly increasing use of higher distribution voltages in industrial and commercial power systems. The capabilities of modem high-voltage fuses are highlighted. Their sphere of utilization in industrial electric distribution systems with the attendant benefits of 1) minimized cost, space requirements, and maintenance of fault protection equipment; 2) minimized disturbances to the power supply system and limiting of the interruption of power to only the faulty component of the system; and 3) maximized security for personnel is illustrated."
"The performance of a process computer installation, which was implemented in 1963, is given. Since a computer is not productive in itself but only production supporting, a word of caution is given not to rely too much on systems experts but on the performance of the company personnel who are responsible for the installation. The use of a small computer installation for raw-mix blending and final-mix control is explored along with the question of which will probably pay the most return in a cement plant. A critical view is given of the status of cement machinery in the United States as compared to Europe with a plea to the machinery industry to improve their performance."
"Industrial noise (a pollutant) can cause various kinds of health damage, including temporary or permanent hearing loss. By obscuring conversation it can be a safety hazard. Laws protecting workers consider only audible sounds, intensity, and duration of exposure. However, hearing damage is also influenced by frequency. Infrasonic and ultrasonic noises may be damaging as well. Cement plant noise up to 106 dBA comes mainly from crushers, mills, kiln burners, and compressors. Control measures, including damping, enclosing, and insulating either source or workers, or providing workers with ear-protective devices are illustrated. Mill noise can be damped by massive foundations. Rubber liners can be used to arrest mill noise up to a 10-dBA noise reduction, and other advantages can be achieved. Properly designed enclosures may surround either the source or the workers. Control rooms have noise levels as low as 66 dBA. Expert help is advised for the successful control of cement-plant noise."
"In deciding to replace the existing plant facilities at Greencastle, Ind., Lone Star Cement Corporation's management was determined to take advantage of all the modern control techniques available in designing a four-million barrels per year facility which would produce a high level of reliable and profitable chemical quality control with dynamic regulation of the process at minimum operating cost. With these objectives in mind, all efforts were directed toward development of the centralized computer control system discussed."
"An analysis of a three-phase ring inverter for purely resistive loads is presented. The initial voltages on all of the six condensers have been taken into account. The instantaneous output voltages and the harmonic content of the output have been obtained. The analysis can be easily extended to circuits with more than six stages, to circuits using a ballast inductance in series with the dc source, and for inductive loads. Experimental results are presented for comparison with the predicted results. In addition, a modified form of circuit, which was found quite adequate for operation on the highly inductive load presented by an induction motor on no load, is presented."
"A model is presented for a simple induction-heating system consisting of a coil constructed from a rectangular conductor and charged with a nonmagnetic billet of the same length. The unique feature of the model is that prediction for losses, efficiency of heating, power factor, and temperature distribution are possible from a knowledge of the coil voltage, coil and billet geometry, and materials parameters. Results from a sample application are compared with experimental data obtained in the course of the study."
"An important control variable for cement kiln process control is material temperature in the various processing zones. Temperature measurements in the calcining zone of the cement kiln utilizing thermocouples becomes impractical because of the corrosive action of the hot gases on the thermocouple protective sheath. The results of the development of a kiln interior temperature sensor which can be utilized in those sections of the kiln which are too hostile for thermocouple installation is described as are the air-purging system, pyrometer, port box, and sight-tube components of the sensor. Sensor-output charts are analyzed, and examples of data output from an on-line computer data-reduction program are discussed. Methods are discussed for determining the optimum sensor location along the rotary kiln."
"The nature of equipment in cement plants requires a maintenance system that prevents costly downtime yet is not unreasonably expensive. An effective system of preventive maintenance sustains production, protects investments, and reduces maintenance production costs."
"Under no-flow conditions, the energy required to maintain a given temperature on a pipe line is directly proportional to the product of the line temperature above ambient and the time that the temperature is maintained. Since outside ambient temperature varies as a sine curve about the average temperature, the amount of heat required is also continuously changing. On a line traced to prevent freezing manually, controlled, or uncontrolled, steam will expend over 700 percent more energy to maintain the temperature than will electric tracing. With flow in the pipe, the heat wasted by steam can be even greater since the flowing material acts as a heat sink. Since the flow conditions affecting heat loss vary greatly, each installation must be calculated separately. It is quite possible that a steam tracer will expend energy at its maximum rate under conditions that would not require any heat. Steam tracing is more efficiently used on lines requiring a temperature approaching that of the tracing steam."
"The first gearless mill has recently been put into service in Le Havre, France. This is probably the world's largest cement mill. The cement output is rated at 200 ton/h, and the motor rating is 8700 hp (7400 kW) at 15 r/min. For the first time in the history of tube mills the driving motor has been built directly on the mill, i. e., the mill drum is also the motor shaft."

  "Of the major problems in the design of oil production facilities is the selection of prime movers for power-driven equipment required in the production and transportation of crude oil. The economic reasons behind the trend in the more widespread use of electric motors from the historical use of gas engines for the large percentage of installations are summarized. Comparative characteristics of electric motors and gas engines are described, and the economic considerations which should be taken into consideration when making a study to select or change prime movers are outlined."
"The equipment grounding system concerns itself with the interconnection and grounding of nonelectrical conducting material which either encloses or is adjacent to energized electric power conductors. Its purpose is to assure that the building containing the electrical system, or the occupants of that building, are not subjected to a dangerous or objectionable environment condition incidental to the use of electrical power. The items of chief concem include: 1) freedom from electric-shock exposure to building occupants; 2) freedom from exposed sparking, arcing, flashing, or other fire ignition origin incident to operation of the electric power system; and 3) freedom from unnecessary electrical noise within the building space resulting from the presence of the electric power system."
"Phase-controlled thyristors connected back-to-back can be used to control the speed of induction motors. The motor windings carry a discontinuous pattern of current. The extinction angle of the thyristors is a function of the firing angle and the motor parameters. The α--β--0 transformation has been used to obtain a complete solution of the voltage equations for a constant speed of the motor. An approximate solution as well as the experimental results are presented."
"Instrument transformers serve an important role in the protective circuits of industrial and commercial electric power systems. They are auxiliary devices that are used in the measurement of current and voltage. They reproduce in their secondary circuits, in a definite and known proportion suitable for use in protective devices, the current or voltage of their primary circuits with the phase relations substantially preserved. They are used to protect personnel and apparatus from high voltages and to permit the use of reasonable and standardized insulation levels and current-carrying capacities in the protective device circuits. The high degree of accuracy required for meters and instruments is not essential for protective purposes. Since system protection and coordination is the subject, the aspects of high accuracy for metering are not covered. The two general types are 1) current transformers, used in current measurement; and 2) potential transformers, used in voltage measurement."
"A theoretical analysis of pulsewidth control in three-phase pulsewidth-modulated inverters, is presented. Two general classifications of commutation schemes are discussed with respect to controllability of output voltage and commutation requirements. It is shown that for one scheme the output waveform is always defined regardless of load conditions but for the other scheme the output waveform is dependent on the load. A method of analysis is described whereby the output voltage, in the latter case, can be determined for sinusoidal load currents. Another method is then introduced whereby these results can be extended to applications with nonsinusoidal load currents."
"The underground fueling system at John F. Kennedy International Airport provides for handling as many as 28 segregations of fuel. These fuels are transferred from a main or bulk storage area, laid out to accommodate 90 large tanks to a satellite or day tank area which is 2 miles closer to the terminals and consists of 40 small tanks. Identity of product by supplier and grade must be maintained in transferring fuel from the bulk to satellite tanks in five pipe-line transfer systems. Reassignment of tankage in both areas and pipe lines is made possible by flexible arrangement of mechanical equipment and piping. Control of the transfer requires automated valves, pumps, tank gauging, and other equipment in both tank farms. To provide supervision and control of this complex system, a data control system was designed, consisting of a GE 412 digital computer, solid-state supervisory system, and backup manual control. The real-time program incorporates many safety checks and alarms and the capability of matching the flexibility of the mechanical system without program changes."
"When spot networks are used to supply large commercial building loads, the utility system and the building wiring must be coordinated in order to provide a high degree of service continuity. The critical point is the service bus and the equipment immediately adjacent. The utility system and the building wiring are discussed and recommendations on how to achieve overall design coordination are made."
"Arcing tests conducted in the electrical laboratory indicate that the most probable value of resistance of the low-voltage arc in ohms is equal to 40 divided by the arcing current to the 0.85 power. It is believed that this equation is approximately correct for 120 to 600 volt, 60-Hz ac stable arcing as ir a typical arcing burn-down in a panelboard or switchboard in which the arc length is approximately 21/2 inches. At any point in the low-voltage system having an impedance of R + jX, the most probable value of arcing current is equal to V/(Rarc + R + jX). The calculation is made by a process of iteration starting with the bolted fault value of current. Curves of arcing current versus bolted fault current simplify the problem of calculating the arcing-current value."
"The modem control using solid-state circuit elements as used on electric mining shovels in the 4-to 20-cubic yard capacity range is described. The basic feedback principle is discussed and how this is used to obtain the desired characteristics required of a modem shovel control system is demonstrated. Maintenance and trouble shooting of the control system are discussed stressing that a logical approach in locating any malfunction must be followed in order to return the machine to productive work as soon as possible. The circuit elements not usually encountered, except in this type of control, are described in the Appendix."
"Studies were made of the characteristics of the plasma flame in trial-manufactured 60-to l00-kW metal-cutting apparatus of the transferred-type nitrogen plasma-jet system. First, the enthalpy of the plasma flame was measured, and the mean temperature was sought. Next, the line spectra radiated from singly ionized ions of nitrogen were utilized to measure the temperatures of the plasma flame. The maximum temperature was about 30 000°K. The speed of flow of the plasma flame was also sought using a high-speed streak camera. The maximum speed was approximately 5000 m/s."
"Several computer-controlled test stands had been designed and built to monitor and contral life and performance tests on most of the control components which are used in major laundry appliances today. In the process, some of the problems associated with using a real-time process control computer for approval testing were solved while still taking full advantage of the computer's inherent capability to perform complex logical operations quickly and effectively. Most of the computer-controlled component test stands were designed specifically for testing components used on the clothes dryer, but the concept of designing a generalized system of control hardware to interface with the computer is applicable to other products. The resulting test stands, therefore, can be used to test automatic washer timers, solenoids, water valves, and switches as well as the relays, switches, and gas valves commonly used on the dryer. In designing the test stands the functions performed by the various components were identified, and components requiring similar control hardware were grouped together. From this grouping it was apparent that only three different types of computer-controlled test stands had to be constructed, one test stand to control thermally actuated components, one to control impulse or step actuated components, and one to test rotary actuated components. The problems associated with obtaining and conditioning the analog and digital signals being transmitted to the computer, and the means by which low-level control signals from the computer are used to control the functioning of the test stand are discussed."
"Some aspects of the use of kinetic energy at the present state of technology and some new solutions are described. The fundamental element is shown in an operational diagram of an asynchronous motor (induction motor) with a static-frequency converter. A machine designed for manual electric welding, which admits electric arc powers sensibly higher than the power of the supply source, is presented as an application. This machine, acting in succession as motor and frequency converter when it rotates due to the kinetic energy accumulated in operating as a motor, is a unique machine, having the construction of an asynchronous motor with wound armature. Theoretical aspects as well as experimental results are presented. Electric arc welding machines using independent low power sources are mentioned. Conclusions are drawn, concerning present possibilities and prospects."
"The noncontacting thermometer for surface temperature measurement of rollers utilizing the radio frequency eddy current effect is described. A type of bridge is employed in this thermometer. The bridge detects a change in the resistivity of a roller material through the radio-frequency measuring coil. This thermometer has considerably improved accuracy with no time lag. The ambient-temperature influence is also compensated for. For example, the sensitivity of this thermometer is in most cases about 10 μA per °C, and the error in temperature was kept to less than 1 °C. Control of any arbitrarily desired temperature is possible through the use of this device."
"Laundry-appliance motors have displayed considerable evolution through the 1960's, and this has led to more critical demands on the thermal protector. This evolution is forecast to continue with still increased efficiencies in the utilization of active materials and the development of advanced insulating materials. These demands were understood by engineers experience in designing thermal-protection systems to be the signal for the development of an advanced generation of laundry-appliance thermal protectors. Application conditions relevant to the design of a thermal protector forlaundry-appliance motors, the interpretation of the effects of these conditions, and the conception of a new thermal protector are described. This protector is then examined in an actual application to a motor and in its operating characteristics; it is also examined in the light of possible changes of application conditions."
"A completely solid-state control system for domestic appliances has recently been developed at the D&M Research Laboratories. While this system was developed specifically for dish-washers, it is readily applicable to all appliances that exhibit complex control problems. The heart of the system is a large-scale custom metal-oxide semiconductor integrated circuit measuring approximately 0.1 inch on a side. This digital circuit, which comprises nearly 600 circuit elements, performs all of the timing and logic functions of the control system. The logic circuit provides for seven different cycles and three distinct temperature modes. However, a greater number or complexity of cycles can readily be incorporated on the logic chip at little additional cost. The integrated circuit controls the electro-mechanical devices in the appliance (such as motors, heater, sole-noids, and lights) through a set of triacs (i.e., bidirectional thyristors). The logic chip and the triacs are mounted on a single printed-circuit board measuring less than 5 inches on a side. The board also accommodates a noninductive regulated dual-level power supply and a novel circuit for electronically contralling the motor-start windings. The all-solid-state approach to appliance control becomes increasingly attractive as new and more sophisticated features (such as motor-speed control, water-level sensing, dryness sensing, etc.) are added to appliances and as the demand for greater reliability increases throughout the appliance industry. It now appears that the solid-state control system described will be economically competitive with comparable electromechanical systems in 1 to 2 years."

"Over the past ten years a number of single and double-layer insulator structures have been studied for passivation of semiconductor device surfaces. This paper reviews the various charge instability mechanisms associated with these structures. These include ionic drift, polarization, slow electronic trapping, and double-layer effects. The known dependence of these effects on processing and material parameters is discussed and the current state-of-the-art for controlling these instabilities is reviewed."
"The effects of mobile ions at insulator surfaces on integrated circuits are reviewed. The published literature is reviewed and recent experimental results are presented. Recent data are given on inversion voltages and surface recombination velocities both in regions under aluminum metal and in regions not covered by metal. Other data include measurements of surface conductivity on different types of surfaces, and a demonstration of the existence of mobile ions at an interface between two insulator layers. Techniques are described for minimizing surface-ion effects on integrated circuits."
"The results of switching measurements on directtunneling mode MNOS (metal-nitride-oxide-silicon) memory transistors in which the thickness of the silicon dioxide layer varies from 15-27.5 Å are presented. The reliability of charge storage effects in these devices is discussed."
"To assess its role in the stable A12O3/SiO2 IGFET's, the conduction properties of pyrolytic A12O3 on silicon have been studied using a combined I-V, C-V 6 technique. Above 2×106 V/cm, barrier limited current is a serious reliability factor, but the polarization current found at low fields should not cause failures."
"MIS structures consisting of a deposited film of A12O3 or Si3N4 on thermally grown SiO2 were studied to determine the effect that charge accumulation at the deposited film-SiO2 interface has on the threshold voltage stability. In order to study the effects of metallization, aluminum, gold and titanium field plates were evaporated on the deposited film. The experimental data indicate that Al forms a lower potential barrier on the deposited film than any of the other metallizations tested. For a given applied bias the shift in the flatband voltage is always greater for samples contacted with aluminum. Ti contacted and Au contacted slices show similar but much smaller shifts in the flatband voltage. It was determined that the charge accumulation is a result of Schottky emission from the metal-deposited film interface. This was determined by the field dependence and supported by the bias asymmetry of the accumulated charge. As a result of this investigation it was determined that the metallization plays an important role in determing the stability of MIS devices under applied bias. However, the use of proper metallization and the selection of low operating field will reduce the accumulation to a point where it will not present a serious reliability problem."
"Recently digital bipolar LSI arrays employing Al-Si Schottky barrier devices have become commercially available. The introduction of a novel semiconductor component in a complex array can raise special reliability questions; the purpose of this work is to investigate the reliability of Al-Si Schottky barrier devices and LSI arrays employing such components. The Schottky barrier devices in these new arrays are primarily employed as clamps on the collector-base junctions of n-p-n switching transistors. In this way, significant forward biasing of the collector-base junction is inhibited, and so minority carrier injection and storage in the collector region is prevented. Thus, the need for lifetime control by gold doping is eliminated; amoung the significant advantages thereby resulting are: - Availability of a much greater variety of device types in the same array. - Simpler and more reproducible processing. In this paper the characteristics and fabrication of Al-Si Schottky barrier devices are first reviewed; then, the results of reliability studies are presented in detail."
"A room temperature ionic instability has been observed on p-channel silicon gate MOS devices processed in a specific manner. This instability appears as a rapid and substantial change of threshold voltage at room temperature consistent with a fast moving ionic species in the gate oxide region. The diffusion constant of this species, measured over the temperature range from 0°C to 75°C is consistent with extrapolated data for H+ ions in SiO2. The magnitude of the room temperature threshold shift is voltage dependent and exists independently of any Na+ contamination. Correctly processed silicon gate devices are completely stable."
"The general characteristics of gradual degradation of III-V compound electroluminescent diodes are reviewed. Seven possible degradation models are considered: high local temperatures, electric-field drift in the junction, electric-field drift in the bulk, optical flux effects, current drag, the extended-Longini mechanism, and the Gold-Weisberg mechanism. Only the last two mechanisms are found to be consistent with the data. At low current densities, the extended-Longini mechanism appears more reasonable, while at higher current densities the phonon-kick mechanism might be dominant. To further clarify the degradation characteristics, additional data is required at low temperatures and also at higher current densities."
"The external quantum efficiency of red GaP light emitting diodes degrades under forward biased operation. The degradation is a complex phenomenon which in the long run is dominated by changes in the bulk semiconductor. This paper is restricted to the discussion of bulk degradation. The symptoms of the degradation are as follows: 1) For a given forward current, the activation energy of the degradation is 0.5-0.8 eV, 2) for a fixed foward voltage, the light output is virtually unchanged while the forward current increases; the non-radiative excess current responsible for the degradation is identified as a tunneling current. The introduction of metallic impurities such as copper into the semiconductor material does not appreciably change the initial quantum efficiency of the device. On the other hand, it shortens the life-time of the device by several orders of magnitude under forward biased operation. The symptoms of the degradation for the copper contaminated devices are identical to those of the noncontaminated devices including the activation energy of the degradation. It is inferred therefore that fast moving impurities such as copper are the major cause of the bulk degradation. Liquid gallium is a known getter for metallic impurities such as copper. For junctions grown in the LPE process using high purity gallium, the longer life can be preserved by the careful elimination of metallic impurities during material growth and device processing."
"The expectation of large volume usage of solid-state lamps, using the GaAs-P system, has generated tremendous effort in this infant field. Data on factors affecting the lifetime of GaAs-P devices will be presented. Several conclusions can be derived which yield valuable criteria for the design and operation of long-life expectancy LED's."
"Life test data on the degradation characteristics of GaAs and GaAlAs light emitting diodes are presented. The GaAs data show the effects of diode processing and impurity concentration on degradation. The AlGaAs diodes prepared during the early stages of their development were tested at various current densities and aged up to 14,000 hours."
"The peak optical power at which catastrophic damage occurs in heterojunction lasers has been investigated. The allowable peak power is shown to decrease significantly with increased pulse length and representative values are given. No significant temperature dependence of allowable peak power was seen. The use of antireflective films is shown to increase the allowable peak power. For a given pulse length and shape, the power level at which damage occurs in the lowest threshold current density (2000-3000 A/cm2) double heterojunction lasers is 2-3 times lower than for single heterojunction devices. Scanning electron microscopy of the damaged lasers suggests fracture and localized heating and melting at the surface. It is postulated that the local surface heating might be caused by the surface absorption of acoustic phonons generated by stimulated Brillouin scattering."
"Associated with plastic encapsulation for micro-circuits is a set of failure mechanisms which may make these devices unsuitable for high reliability use. Various experiments, as well as conventional environmental testing, have been performed on a wide variety of plastic encapsulated ICs, as well as on equivalent ceramic types. The results elucidate fundamental limitations of plastic packaging, reveal mechanisms of failure, and suggest departures from conventional military screening and qualification procedures which would be essential to assurance of acceptable devices."
 "A summary of the proposed conditions for control or evaluation of each feature of a design for a plastic-encapsulated device is as follows: 1. Screening and life testing for siliconchip surface problems, with high confidence of achieving the required reliability and with reasonable times, requires junction temperatures of the order of 175-300C, with reverse bias. This dictates the use of a silicone molding material, or other material which wi stand the test temperature. 2. For assurance against alkali ion contamination, the chip should be protected with a barrier, such as silicon nitride, over the usual thermally-grown oxide. Testing with deliberate sodium contamination can serve to determine the resistance of a product to sodium ion effects. The plastic should not, however, contain fillers which can provide sodium ions to the chip surface since that would place an additional burden on assuring the perfection of the barrier material. 3. Gold metallizing should, be used in order to avoid intermetallic compound growth at internal lead bonds (with gold wires) and to avoid the electromigration and chemical and electrolytic corrosion problems of aluminum. The lack of an hermetic seal increases the necessity of this protection against corrosion 4. The shape of the plastic mold and the choice of lead-frame material and dimensions should assure lead seal integrity at all conditions of test and field use. This assures freedom from introduction of gross amounts of water vapor to the areas of closely-spaced metals at the chip surface. 5."
"The influence of processing on the moisture resistance of epoxies and silicones used for packaging semiconductor devices is investigated. Conditions are assumed analogou to a capacitor charging up through a series resistance, and it is shown that this model applies with sufficient accuracy for optimally processed plastic compounds. Deviations indicate incorrect procecsing. Based on the model, characteristic values for moisture permeability and moisture capacity are defined and their variations with the processing conditions discussed. It is shown how the moisture capacity and moisture resistance influence semiconductor devices, and the relationship between moisture parameters and other characteristic values of the plastic is indicated."
"Hydrogen gas, the foaming agent in RTV-5370 silicone foam encapsulating plastic, caused resistance increases in thin film Evanohm resistors. The hydrogen is a byproduct of the polymerization of hydrosiloxane groups with polymeric hydroxy functional siloxanes. The hydrogen gas is produced over an extended time period and trapped in the sealed circuit box. The gas then diffuses through the silicone resin coating and protective vinyl shrink tubing surrounding the metal film, with a rate which is proportional to pressure and temperature. The polymerization reaction of the foam can be driven to completion by heating in air at 100°C for 24 hours. Outdiffusion of the hydrogen gas from the affected resistors will occur on heating in air at 100°C for 48 hours or more. By fitting analytical solutions of the diffusion equation to the observed in and out diffusion data, the diffusion coefficient for the encapsulant surrounding the resistor film was found to be D = 2.82 × 10-4 exp (- 0.28 eV/kT)cm2/sec The resistance increase is caused by the high solubility of hydrogen in nickel. The hydrogen increases the residual resistivity but not the TCR of the film. The sensitivity of nickel containing resistor materials, such as Evanohm or Nichrome, to hydrogen suggests that hydrogen producing encapsulants should not be used with non-hermetic devices, and that no hydrogen should be included in the protective atmosphere of hermetically sealed devices."
 "This late news paper presents the results of the examination of the screening effectiveness of steam pressure and boiling water stresses for rapidly evaluating potential failures on long term, accelerated humidity life testing. Studies such as these should allow the development of standard accelerated evaluation tests for assessing device design capabilities on a periodic basis and for acceptance of groups of devices. Also, it could be possible to determine the relationship between these accelerated tests and application environments."
"A current induced \"open\" in an aluminum stripe is caused by an accumulation of vancancies at some point in the film, i.e., by a nonvanishing divergence in the ion flux. Work reported in the literature has dealt predominantly with electromigration damage resulting from a nonuniform temperature profile. This paper concerns damage sites related to structural irregularities at grain boundary intersections. The nature of these structural irregularities was studied in fine-grained films having preferred orientation. We show that in a film where a high degree of preferred orientation exists, the diffusivity is considerably less than in a film of mixed orientation. When boundary mobility is more or less uniform, i.e., in highly oriented films, the predominant damage sites are at points where abnormally large grains statistically are found along the stripe length. Damage here arises mainly from the difference in effective grain boundary area at the junction between the small equiaxed structure and the large grains. In films that have a mixed orientation, another mechanism becomes of considerable importance. Flux divergences can now result from the intersection of boundaries having different diffusivities associated with them. This may manifest itself as a local change in the activation energy for diffusion or as a change in the number of available diffusion sites per boundary. We have made steady state calculations of the local vacancy supersaturations to be expected at each of the divergent sites mentioned above, i.e."
"A theory is presented which predicts the time required for a metal film conductor on a silicon substrate to fail as a result of electromigration. The failure time depends inversely on the current density, J, and on the temperature gradient. For a self heated conductor this may be simplified to a dependence on J-3. Experimental results for aluminium films show a failure time of 125 hours at 106 A cm-2 and 200°C in agreement with theory."
"The magnitude of current crowding and its effects on failure mechanisms at aluminum-silicon contacts have been studied by using an enlarged contact. Current was found to decrease exponentially with distance from the leading edge of the contact. Joule heating in the contact when stressed at high currents caused diffusion of silicon into the aluminum metallization. Accelerated testing at low currents to minimize this effect resulted in diffusion barrier type failures."
"The parameters governing void and whisker growth in aluminum thin metal conductors have been well defined in the past several years. Studies have also been conducted to define these parameters in other metal systems such as composite molybdenum-gold stripes. Nearly all of these studies have examined the test vehicle before and after stressing but rarely during the stress period. This paper interprets the results obtained when thin metal conducting stripes of molybdenum-gold and aluminum were current stressed while being viewed at high magnifications through the scanning electron microscope. To facilitate this, photographs were taken at a rate of one per minute and then used to produce a motion picture. When viewed, this allows real time study of reactions which occurred over extended periods of time. The study of these motion pictures confirmed some of the existing theories of void formation but has also resulted in a reevaluation of the subsequent movement of the voids along the conductor. The overall result of the experiment has been a greatly enhanced understanding of mass transport in conducting stripes."
"An analysis of the open metallization problem at oxide steps at the surface of planar devices is described. This failure mechanism is essentially based upon the presence of a film discontinuity which grows during the evaporation process at the interface of coarse and dense crystal structures of the evaporated film. The growth rate of the coarse surface is somewhat larger than that of the normal surface. This mismatch in growth rates gives rise to the film discontinuity due to the self-shadowing effect by the former surface. The film discontinuity is apt to occur at the sharp step of phosphosilicate glass because of the following two reasons: a) a large vapor-incidence angle to the perpendicular side wall; b) a spontaneous growth of the coarse surface at the sharp edge of the step. Techniques investigated to improve the interconnection reliability include: a) evaporation at elevated substrate temperature (~ 300°C), b) reduction of the thickness of phosphosilicate glass, c) perpendicular vapor incidence to the substrate and d) protection of thle discontinuity against corrosive agents."
"Minute cracks have been observed in semiconductor device metallization at the edges of contact windows. The cracks are formed during deposition of the aluminum and not during subsequent processing, although subsequent processing can aggravate the effect. The cracking is shown to be caused by shadowing, aggravated in some instances by angle-of-incidence effects, and can be expected to occur with many different evaporation source geometries. The problem can be avoided by correct shaping of oxide steps or by reducing the height of the oxide step. The effectiveness of heating the substrate during evaporation in eliminating certain types of cracks is discussed."
"Step coverage of metal stripes over high angle steps on integrated circuit wafers is-necessary to produce reliable multi-level metal interconnect circuits. In order to determine the optimum deposition geometry for obtaining good step coverage a mathematical model has been developed which applies to all deposition geometries using straight line deposition. The model has been programmed to give a profile of the metal across steps or troughs. It takes into account the oblique incidence shadowing and gives the thickness uniformity across the wafer holder. Assumptions include a sticking coefficient of unity, pressure in the molecular flow range, and negligible mobility of depositing atoms on the surface of the substrate. Various evaporation and sputtering systems using point sources (filaments) and small area sources (boats) have been evaluated using the model. Step angles from 60° to 90° with various orientations on the substrate have been theoretically investigated. Profiles were plotted from the computer data for 90° steps and will be presented and compared with some actual cross sections representative of the assumed conditions for applicability of the model. The major problem areas defined by this work are self-shadowing at the edge of steps due to the oblique incidence necessary to obtain good step coverage and the necessity for the use of rather complex planetary motion type systems in order to obtain good step coverage."

"The areas in which perhaps most is at stake concerning economy and reliability of semiconductor components is that of attaching devices and integrated circuits into packages. The most common situation involves a single component, per package, although multi-component encapsulation and hybrid integrated circuits represent rapidly growing fields. A great many bonding techniques and geometries have evolved and are in use today--thermocompression and ultrasonic wire bonding (wedge and ball), welding, soldering, eutectic brazing, organic adhesion, flip chip bonding (solder and ultrasonic), beam lead, and spider. From the standpoint of reliability physics, the number of problems inherent in this multiplicity of bonding techniques is considerably expanded by the number of materials commonly utilized with each technique, and by the variety of package environments that are in use. All of this is further modified by the controls exercised on bonding and packaging during manufacture."
"Ultrasonically bonded interconnects have been made to semiconductor devices with both 1% SiAl and 1% MgAl wire. This investigation indicates that 1% MgAl wire is not a dominant cause of electrical degradation in any device studied. On the other hand, the effects of annealing time ue to 1000 hours and annealing temperature up to 300°C on the strength of the wire demonstrate the mechanical superiority of the 1% MgAl wire. The two types of wire have a similar behavior in relation to the effects of ultrasonic power and time on wire deformation and bond strength. A critical amount of energy input, as evidenced by wire deformation, is necessary for a strong bond, and further deformation weakens the interconnection. This investigation indicated that the one mil, 1% MgAl wire has potentially higher reliability than the 1% SiAl wire."
"The production of devices with highest reliability is the result of optimum specifications on equipment and piece parts together with a process which has been selected from knowledge of how the operating variables affect the bond. This knowledge must be developed on each bonding system by a series of test samples, with suitable curves developed, which enable the engineer to select the process."
"Intermetallic formation in gold-aluminum systems has been studied at 200°C to 460°C using butt-welded diffusion couples. The predominant intermetallic phase was found to be Au5Al2, but all five equilibrium phases of the system were present in the couples after annealing at long times. The kinetics of the process were measured and the activation energy for overall intermetallic formation was found to be 15.9 kcal/mol. The effect of silicon on intermetallic formation was also investigated. It was found that while silicon had little effect on the growth rate of AuAl, Au2Al, Au5Al2, and Au4Al, it substantially increased the amount of purple phase in the couples. An electron microprobe traverse indicated that this purple phase contained 6 wt% Si. The relative tensile strengths of the intermetallics were determined indirectly by measuring the tensile properties of the diffused couples. It was found that all the intermetallics were stronger than gold or aluminum. However, appreciable voiding occurred in Au5Al2 after long times above 300°C and in AuAl2 after long times above 400°C weakening these phases catastrophically. The voiding was greatly accelerated by intermittent aging."
"It has been observed that gold-aluminum bond degradation is dependent upon the ambient gas that exists in an integrated circuit package. Hermetic samples, which characteristically exhibit severe bond degradation when subjected to a stress of 250°C for 50 hours, were found to have an order of magnitude improvement in time-to-failure when subjected to the same temperature stress, but with the bonds exposed to an open air ambient. A bond pull strength of less than 1.0 gram was used as a failure criteria. Significant metallurgical effects were observed to correspond to the bond strength data. Mass spectrometry techniques were used to gas analyne both degraded and unstressed samples in an effort to determine the gas which causes the severe degradation. Although many residual gases were observed in the hermetic samples, none could consistently explain the observed effect. The analysis leads to the conclusion that there was no gas in the hermetic samples causing the degradation. Rather, it was concluded that the presence of oxy, gen substantially extends the life of gold-aluminum bonds."
"The reliability of 150Å thick Ni-Cr films used for resistors was studied. It was found that these films deposited on SiO2 were continuous, void-free, and not susceptible to intermetallic formation with aluminum during normal device processing. No evidence of electromigration was found in these films after continuous powering at current densities up to 5.9 × 106 amps/cm2 for 1000 hours; nor were failures found for power cycling at these current densities for up to 7.2 × 109 cycles."
"The degradation of Au/Al contacts on semiconductor devices as a function of process parameters and environment has been studied. Test samples were bonded under variable conditions of temperature and pressure and tested in atmospheres of N2, O2, Air, H2O at 200°C and 300°C. Bond strengths and bond degradation were evaluated by bond pull tests and metallographic and SEM techniques. The two major failure modes are found to be ball lift-off at the pad and wire break immediately above the ball. The effect of process parameters, especially temperature and pressure are evident after exposure to 200°C and 300°C bakes. The effects of environment can be qualitatively correlated with the bond process. To define the failure mechanism precisely is difficult. The role oxygen may play in enhancing aluminum-gold bond degradation is argumentative at best. The presumably simple oxidation of a metal such as iron or aluminum is actually not that simple. It consists of several steps with intermediate stages as metal to metal bonds are disrupted and the oxygen molecule itself is disassociated. It may well be that during this oxidation sequence when aluminum-aluminum bonds are disrupted, intermetallic formation with gold is accelerated. If such an accelerating mechanism does exist, a nitrogen ambient would not show the sane effect. However, it is quite probable that smrall amounts of water vapor would act similarly to oxygen."
"This report evaluates and compares two electrical screening tests for integrated circuits, functional and pin-to-pin, over a period of 5,000 hours of operational life testing. Of a sample of 1,000 integrated circuits, 71% were initially identified by the functional screen as high qua'lity devices as opposed to 28% by the pin-to-pin screen. In addition, only 10 devices from the sample were commonly rejected by both tests. Further analysis revealed that 18 functional unacceptable devices were classified as pin-to-pin high quality devices and that 31 pin-to-pin unacceptable devices were classified as functional high quality. In general, the number of test failures observed remained constant during the first 5,000 hours of life testing. However, in the case of the load resistor test (pin-to-pin) and the output current test (functional), the number of test failures decreased as the testing time increased. An examination of the screening data after 5,000 hours of life testing showed essentially no change in the quality distribution of the sample as measured by the functional tests. However, the pin-to-pin screen showed a significant change in the sample distribution, with a number of circuits going from the high quality grouping to the commercial grouping."
"A multiple phase, high reliability test program for discrete semiconductor devices, recently completed for the Polaris missile program is described. The role of the electronics subcontractor as equipment designer and manufacturer, test and failure analysis laboratory, and technical liaison during concurrent supplier, subcontractor, prime contractor testing is discussed. Approximately 400, 000 production parts comprised of twenty-two discrete device types, were assigned as the subcontractor's responsibility for procurement of screened parts, evaluation of fest results, verification testing, failure analysis and lot disposition. These parts included NPN and PNP transistors, general purpose, zener and reference diodes, varicaps, SCR's and dual junction FET's. The basic concept of using only a precap visual, environmental screening, and subsequent assessment testing to bring common parts up to a high reliability level is discussed. The relative effectiveness of each test phase is evaluated in terms of yield and early detection of failure modes."
"To insure the reliable operation of electronic components under the different environmental conditions encountered in the field, IBM has established an environmental reliability program. The intent of this program is to first simulate field conditions and then to develop. accelerating laboratory conditions. This paper deals with the required hostile environment engineering. Emphasis is placed on simulation techniques, environmental guidelines and types of degradation mechanisms which could result in equipment malfunction. The experimental dosages are based on the concentration range of gases and particulates which are present in polluted city atmospheres. The requirements. and considerations used in designing and choosing simulation systems will be briefly discussed. The requirements include the ability to vary the dosing concentration by at least three orders of magnitude in the parts per million-parts per billion range, and to use 'in situ' pure gas dilution rather than prediluted gas mixtures. An additional requirement is to use as many as six or more dopant gases. These requirements and the difficulties inherent in simulation systems have caused us to adopt certain design criteria. These include dynamic mode of operation rather than a static mode, as well as a modular dosing technique. This dynamic mode of operation permits on-line concentration adjustments and periodic or semi-continuous automatic monitoring. The dosing technique used allows us to use two dosing devices - permeation tubes and a dynamic serial dilution device as building blocks for achieving multi-gas dilution over a wide concentration range."
"A technique is introduced which optimizes the selection of parts for system application by reliability/quality levels through systematizing the compilation and processing of necessary data. The comparative influence of systems cost or performance parameters such as repair cost, storage time, cost of failure, and mission duty cycle are discussed. Promising approaches to parts optimization at the subsystem level are reviewed. A means for evaluating the system impact of items of uncertain failure rate is illustrated."
"The reliability of a large scale integrated circuit chip is an aggregate of the reliability of each of its constituents. Therefore, the total failure rate is determined by simply evaluating the contribution of each constituent individually and independently. This is achieved by subjecting each part (e.g. a devrice or a conductor) to stress testing and subsequently translating its failure rate to machine-use conditions. Such tests, however, cannot be performed on a complex product chip because it is impossible to isolate a desired area. The only answer to this problem is to design a test pattern for each of the necessary tests. To illustrate the effectiveness of this vehicle, a special test chip designed to evaluate the reliability of Cogar's high performance read-write memory system is described in detail."
"High volume production of sophisticated equipment combined with high reliability requirements, using Mil-Spec parts, has necessitated the development of comprehensive failure analysis techniques for solid tantalum capacitors. Detailed studies have resulted in an increased understanding of manganese dioxide integrity and the silver paint-solder system."
"The use of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) as an in-line, quality control tool to selectively sample-screen semiconductor devices for metallization anomalies is recommended in future procurements. Experiences with failed devices at GSFC have led to development of an inspection technique and a subsequent specification which are discussed in this report. Criteria (with typical demonstrative photographs) are proposed for distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable units and the viewing parameters necessary to effect meaningful examination are given; viz., the angle of sample tilt relative to the primary beam, the proper sample rotation relative to contact windows, and the necessary magnification range. The proposed sampling and inspection procedure is designed to create minimum perturbation in the normal manufacturing process and to detect, at an early stage, those metallization anomalies which affect device reliability and which cannot be resolved by the optical microscope during preseal visual inspection. The procedure, as well as lot acceptance plan, is outlined pointing out both the advantages to the user and the manufacturer. Preliminary results and manufacturers' acceptance of this plan will be discussed."
 "Charge storage in single (SiO2) and double-layer (SiO2: Al2O3) insulating films has been investigated by observing the thermal annealing of the radiation-induced space charge in IGFET structures. Evidence presented indicates that the anneal in both films is characterized by a two-step process. The first appears to involve a spatial redistribution of the space charge. This is followed, at a somewhat higher temperature, by neutralization of the added space charge induced by the radiation. Observations on the single-layer insulating films of SiO2 yield activation energies for both processes on the order of 0.3 eV. Experiments on the double-layer films of A1203, pyrolytically deposited on SiO2, indicate that the dominant activation energies for both processes lie in the range from 0.6 to 0.7 eV. However, there is evidence of a small admixture of lower energy processes."
"The main features of the behavior of bipolar and MOS transistors under ionizing radiations are first briefly reminded and the physical origin of degradation is then analyzed by the authors. They propose a model in agreement with experiments. The results obtained are introduced in equivalent electrical models of planar devices in order to evaluate the reliability of complex circuits, if computer aided design is used."
"The susceptibility of Insulated Gate Field Effect Transistors (IGFETS) to ionizing radiation (neutron and gamma) has been exhaustively studied in the past few years1-3. Furthermore, it has been established that most of the damage, and hence degradation, is due to positive charge generation and accumulation in the insulating region. It has also been determined that the thermal stability and intrinsic reliability of an IGFET is strongly dependent on the physical characteristics of the insulating layer. The purpose of this paper is to report on the results of an effort which successfully established and demonstrated a correlation between the intrinsic reliability and radiation susceptibility of IGFETS. Both commercially available units and specially fabricated devices were tested. The commercial units included General Instrument's 2N4353 p-channel MOS FETS, Fairchild's FI-100 and 2N4067 dual p-channel MOS FETS, Motorola's 2N4351 and 2N4352 n- and p-channel MNOS respectively, and Hughes' HRN1030 p-channel, low threshold, MNOS. The custom fabricated units were supplied by Hughes and were electrically similar to HRN1030 units but differed in oxide thickness and the absence of a nitride layer. Each ensemble of units was divided into two subassemblies. One-half the units were irradiated and the remaining devices were temperature cycled. Irradiation was carried out using a Van de Graaff accelerator with a peak electron energy of 1.7 MeV. In the gamma mode, a bremsstrahlung spectra was obtained with a mean energy of 1 MeV. The dose rate varied from 300 to 3000 rad/sec, and the maximum total dose per irradiation was 106 rads."
"The \"batch conceptl\" used in modern semiconductor device processing can lead to a degradation of silicon wafer-perfection during device fabrication. Such a degradation may result in low or zero yield of good devices around the periphery of the wafer. It is shown that peripheral yield loss can be avoided or minimized whenever temperature gradients arising during cooling of a \"row of wafers\" are eliminated."
"DEPOSITED DIELECTRIC PROFILES-IN COMPLEX SEMICONDUCTOR CIRCUITS Oxide profiles are a critical parameter in a production of reliable multi-layer monolithic circuits. These deposited dielectrics serve to insulate overlapping metal layers while simultaneously allowing fabrication of high density circuitry within a minimized die area. Foremost among the desirable qualities of these dielectrics is their ability to adequately cover both metal and oxide on the flat surfaces of the die as well as over the steps. Poor coverage can result in a variety of catastrophic electrical problems which lead to both expensive and inefficient processing. Until recently the direct observation of integrated circuit surfaces has been limited to optical and metalographic methods. Scanning Electron Microscopy provides a useful means of obtaining the detailed and descriptive information necessary to characterize oxide and metal profiles. Three phases of oxide coverage were studies in this program using the Scanning Electron Microscope: (1) Deposited oxide over thermal oxide (2) Deposited oxide over metal patterns (3) Growth profiles of deposited oxides Phase I has shown how deposited oxide replicates its thermal counterpart. Phase II, on the other hand, has yielded valuable information about the effect of underlying metal profiles on oxide deposition. The details of how deposited oxides establish their final configurations have been demonstrated by varying oxide thickness and observing surface profiles in Phase III."
"Carbon-like interface films exert both a metallurigical and electrical effect on Semiconductor products. Test devices without contamination have uniform silicon to aluminum diffusion, Rc approximately 3 × 10-7 ohms cm2, and Vbe(sat) = 0. 84 v. Similar devices with massive interface films have restricted silicon to aluminum diffusion, Rc greater than 10-6 devices recover during operation."
"Degradation of hFE in bipolar transistors has been a recurrent problem with all makers and users of solid state devices. To date, three distinct mechanisms have been identified with hFE degradatiofi and are the subject of this paper. The first and most important hFE degradation mechanism, that associated with positive ion migration within the passivating device oxide, requires total protection of that oxide if device reliability is to be assured. The second mechanism, that associated with emitter-base reverse bias avalanche, is due to the introduction of fast surface states. While these two mechanisms affect hFE primarily at low collector current levels, a third mechanism has been identified which affects hFE at moderate current levels as well."
"To achieve good high-power performance, power transistors are often constructed having a fine interdigitated structure. These transistors are very susceptible to second breakdown, however, particulary at high voltage. A simple method of estimating the temperature distribution in the transistor chip made it possible to design structures with up to seven-fold better pulses power handling capability."
"Emitter avalanche stress is of growing importance for the study of dielectric coatings on semiconductors and for the investigation of the reliability of devices. In particular certain similarities between the behaviour during high temperature reverse bias testing and B-B avalanching indicate that a study of the failure modes occurring during E-B avalanche stress can provide information on the phenomena occurring during cut-off testing of the same device. This study was done by means of npn transistors with a field plate above the emitter-base junction. The dagradation phenomena occurring during E-B avalanche stress could be described by the generation of recombination centres at the Si-SiO2 interface and by the trapping of negative charge in the oxide. Experimental relationships governing these phenomena were found."

"The purpose of the analyzer is to save time and effort in determining the following basic MOS-FET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) parameters: the performance factor ß, the corresponding threshold voltage VGS(T), and the transconductance gm. The MOS-FET analyzer comprises a square-root calculator whose output is displayed on the x-y system of a scope, and thereby offers a readout of the above three quantities of the MOS-FET."
"An electronic system is described for controlling a semiconductor laser, which is convenient for measuring semiconductor carrier lifetimes of 500 ns or greater by the photoconductive decay method with the laser providing the sample illumination. Particular attention is given to the circuit of the power pulse generator, which was designed to operate the laser above threshold and to provide a means of controlling the output intensity of the laser radiation."
"An accurate delay-time measuring equipment operating in the 50-GHz region has been developed. The equipment can measure wide-band delay-time characteristics of millimeter wave component and waveguide line. Sweep frequency range is variable from 0 to 1.5 GHz at any of the 46 to 52 GHz. The measurement method employs the usual comparison method and a newly developed rapid automatic switching method. The accuracy of the equipment is 0.1 ns at 20-dB insertion loss. Finally, some measured results are described."
"A wide-band (8.2-12 GHz) microwave interferometer was developed to measure the complex transmission coefficient of samples inserted in a waveguide system. Amplitude A and phase shift ϕ of a signal are presented either as A sin ϕ, A cos ϕ versus frequency, or in polar coordinate form Aeiϕ as frequency is swept. The attenuation range of measurement is 0-50 dB; phase shifts between n·2πand (n + 1)·2π are given as ϕ - n·2π (n = 0, 1, 2,···). The unique feature of this system is its ability to measure broad frequency bands in a simple way. The system was tested with components with known characteristics and used to measure transmission of a sheet of water."
"The problem of adaptor evaluation is of considerable interest in the UHF and microwave art where, because of the several different types of transmission line in common use, there is a frequent need to extend an established measurement capability in one type of line to other types of lines, e.g., from rectangular waveguide to coax. In power and noise calibrations, it is the adaptor efficiency which is usually of interest, and one indication of the adaptor losses may be obtained by connecting an identical pair \"back to back\" and measuring the insertion loss of the combination by the usual techniques. If, then, the losses are assumed to divide equally between the two, the efficiency is thereby determined. As a practical matter, the losses do not, in general, divide equally, which leads to an error whose evaluation is the subject of this paper. In particular it is shown that the method is capable of good accuracy provided that the assumed identity of the two adaptors is satisfied."
"Precision microwave insertion-loss measurements are an important part of the evaluation and calibration of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory-NASA low-noise deep-space communication systems. A study of cooled transmission-line components was initiated with the Rantec Corporation in July 1966. The preliminary work at Rantec involved WR 430 waveguide insertion-loss calibrations using a microwave cavity Q technique. JPL verified the technique by repeating the calibration using a direct insertion-loss measurement technique between matched components. The JPL measurements are described in detail, and the critical areas identified. The difference between the reported JPL (0.00427 dB) and Rantec (0.00414 dB) measurements of 0.00013 dB is within experimental accuracies and adds to the confidence factor of both measurement techniques."
"Two generalized criteria for minimums and maximums of essential nonlinearity of a phase-sensitive detection system are presented. Minimums and maximums are calculated and plotted by a digital computer over a wide dynamic range of operating conditions, assuming that the input signal is in the narrow-band Gaussian noise."
"An accurate power measurement technique is described, which makes possible the determination of the net power delivered to a load of arbitrary impedance over a wide power range. A standard power meter is employed to fix a reference power level. Subsequent measurements consist of dimensionless ratios that can be obtained from precision attenuators. The method is applicable to a very wide range of frequencies and was demonstrated at a frequency of 30 MHz with power measurements extending from 10-2 to 10-14 watt. Maximum uncertainties ranged from ~0.5 to 1.5 percent. This technique is applicable in the measurement of the sensitivity of very-low-level detectors, receivers, radiometers, etc."
"In the determination of absolute frequency, conventional approaches have been either frequency or period counting, both of which are subject to resolution-bandwidth tradeoffs and frequency distortion. This paper presents a new technique that avoids such tradeoffs and separates the filtering and sampling functions, giving greater flexibility and enabling one to work down to the limits established by the noise included with the signal. The technique is the use of a commercial frequency synthesizer as the local oscillator in a phase-locked loop. The paper describes this approach, discusses certain modifications that must be made to the synthesizer if it is to work in this configuration, and discusses the design of a type 2, sixth-order feedback system that produces a better approximation to ideal filter response than is obtained by conventional second-order designs."
"A new technique is presented for establishing a standard of electric field strength using a highly conducting sphere. An analysis is made to determine the current on the sphere as a function of the electric field strength of an incident plane wave. A method of measuring that current using electronic circuitry and an optical indicator within the sphere is described, and an intercomparison is made with an independent field-strength standard. This technique is a significant improvement over previous ones in that it permits the absolute determination of field strength with a maximum uncertainty of 1 percent or less at 30 MHz and is applicable to a broad range of frequencies and field strengths."
"A dc output voltage proportional to the phase angle between any two accessible points in an ac system is generated by the circuitry described in this paper. The transient response of the output voltage involves delays of less than one ac cycle, which represents an advance upon established techniques, and the linearity is of the order of 1 percent. The device has been used for alternator load-angle measurement and in sensing for control of excitation of an alternator in response to load-angle changes. Essentially, a flip-flop is turned on by one of the ac input waveforms and is turned off again by the waveform derived from the other point in the system with respect to which the phase angle is to be measured. To achieve the fast transient response there are six such flip-flops and thus six output pulses per ac cycle, which are then passed through a T-section m-derived filter with band rejection at six times the basic ac frequency. Discrete transistors have been used and their number has been kept to a minimum by the use of circuits with three and six stable states."
"A new power and energy-to-frequency converter is described. Its operation is based on two closed-loop mean-square value-to-frequency converters of new conception in which a direct digital feedback is used. Error analysis is carried out and performance data of an experimental circuit using indirectly heated thermistors are given. The instrument is suitable for digital power measurement for both dc and ac wide-band signals disregarding its waveform."
"This paper is concerned with the measurement of the mass of electrode material released by the electrodes during a high-vacuum breakdown. The techniques used in the experiment described in this paper for quantitative measurement of material released from the electrodes are neutron activation analysis and gamma-ray spectrometry. The method permits determination of the small masses released during the discharge. The threshold energy density required for material release is 15 J/mm2. An empirical equation is given for the material erosion for copper and a curve is given that relates mass erosion versus stored energy for copper electrodes. The experiment indicates that the mechanism responsible for current transport between the electrodes in a vacuum breakdown is a highly ionized plasma formed from the released electrode material."
"The noise in the FM telemetry channel may decrease significantly the accuracy of accelerometer readings. The noise effects in both digital and analog accelerometers are examined in this paper. A maximum-likelihood estimate of the accelerometer output is made and the mean-square error of the estimate is evaluated. It is shown that the digital accelerometer is superior to the analog accelerometer in the presence of noise. Two methods of reducing the mean-square error are suggested."
"A current regulator for the operation of gas discharges is described, capable of delivering peak currents up to 1 ampere and average currents of up to 0.5 ampere with voltage excursions to 9 kV. Completely floating two-terminal operation accomodates different load configurations. By means of externally supplied timing pulses the output current can be programmed to generate rectangular or trapezoidal current waveforms. For rectangular output pulses, switching speeds of 5 μs into low-impedance loads and slewing rates of 500 V/μs for high-impedance loads can be obtained. The output resistance is in excess of 107 ohms, shunted by 50-250 pF, depending on regulator configuration."
"This paper presents a circuit system functioning as a capacitance meter suitable for very-high-loss material with a wide range of application in various fields of scientific research and industrial operation. The minimum equivalent parallel resistance of the specimen to be measured reaches as low as 50 ohms and the measuring range of capacitance is from about 0.1 ~ 1000 pF at 2 MHz. Some experimental data are given for the appreciation of its characteristics."
"A common problem in industrial processes, particularly those involving electroheat, is the holding of metallic charges at their solid/liquid state interface temperature. A transducer has been developed that achieves this by plunging and widthrawing a probe in an induction-heated metallic charge. The probe is driven by a servomotor whose armature current senses the state of the charge. Successful results have been obtained with induction-heated metals and alloys. In many cases the degree of control is so precise that the limit cycle amplitude is undetectable. Preliminary investigations into nonmetallic charges have also been conducted. These can be successful provided the induction heater output is low. The new transducer is simple, rugged, inexpensive, and constructed from items readily available in industrial instrumentation laboratories. The presentation is intended for the professional engineer concerned with the control of industrial processes."

"The response of the Doppler radar speed meter was analyzed when there were two or more targets in a radar beam. When there are two targets of equal size and equal speed there is a fading condition and under a special condition, the radar becomes inoperative. When many targets with various speeds and sizes appear in a radar beam, the speed-meter output will fluctuate and the output represents either the speed of one of the targets or the average speed of all of them or something else. The speed meter is not likely to register the speed of the target with the highest speed as commonly believed. There is no theoretical assurance that the speed meter is registering the wanted target's speed. The fading condition, the fading period, the speed-meter fluctuation frequency, and the speed-meter response to the actual target speeds were theoretically analyzed. Traffic-police radar was mainly used for examples."
"In pomology, besides developing a high yield and good tasty fruit (such as the apple), the appearance or color of the fruit is very important for marketing purposes. This paper describes an integrating spectrophotometer that senses the incoming and shade energy of the electromagnetic spectrum continuously in the region between 3840 and 8960 Å at eleven different wavelengths. The energies of these selected wavelengths are amplified, stored, and integrated. Thus, at the end of a growth period of any fruit to be studied, a total energy of each bandwave reaching the fruit will be available. The filters are placed in a Teflon dome and shaped and hung on the tree of the fruit to be studied."
"This paper is a survey of methods of high-impulse current and voltage measurement. Typically, such measurement techniques must now include capabilities for measuring high-energy impulses having peak powers as high as many megawatts, currents as high as many mega-amperes, or voltages as high as several megavolts, with rise times as short as a fraction of a microsecond (even as short as the subnanosecond range for moderately high-energy impulses). These capabilities had to be attained in recent years to meet the needs of various areas of scientific research employing such high-energy impulses. This represents a significant extension in the state of the art of such measurement techniques beyond their more traditional role in development and testing of high-voltage bulk power system equipment. The three most commonly used methods of high-impulse current measurement are the magnetic probe, current transformer, and \"pure\" resistive shunt methods. These methods are treated in considerable detail. High-voltage capacitive dividers, resistive dividers, and reflection-type attenuators are covered as the principal methods of high-impulse voltage measurement, with some added discussion of the means of insulating such devices. A brief description is given of schemes involving use of laser light sources to measure high-impulse currents and voltages by means of magnetooptic and electrooptic effects. Diagnosis of the complete properties of high-power pulses is also discussed. The emphasis throughout the paper is on a review directed toward practical measurement considerations and techniques."
"An experiment is described in which broad-band pseudo-noise modulation and tracking techniques were used to measure precisely the range from an earth station to near-synchronous satellites. Range measurements of approximately 22 000 miles were performed with a total error of less than 120 feet, with rms jitter errors of about 3 feet, and with readout resolution of 1 foot."
"The slowly moving arc has been instrumented for position and velocity. A practical arc model has been used that has particular application to the needs of industry. Analog circuitry has been developed that interfaces the arc plant with a digital computer. A computer strategy has been applied for time-average filtering without losing the resolution capability of the computer's A/D converter. Through digital differentiation, arc velocity signals are obtained of a quality adequate for industrial control. The entire system is oriented towards the low-priced computer increasingly available in industry. Appendix I contains the flow chart for implementing this instrumentation on a computer. Appendix II presents a simple mathematical model of the instrumentation system."
"Bridge methods are the most accurate means of determining the parameters of quartz vibrators, particularly in the VHF region and above. Present and future crystal requirement specifications point to the increasing use of such methods to obtain the accuracy necessary for both filter and oscillator applications. A practical difficulty that arises is that the ranges of any given bridge are not compatible with every immittance characteristic encountered with the various crystal types in use, particularly if measurements are to be made over substantially different portions of the region of resonance. One means of obviating this difficulty is to augment the crystal with another impedance element in series or parallel so that the behavior of the combination is accommodated within the bridge ranges. A capacitance in parallel with the crystal is suitable for reducing the variation in impedance bridges that consider the unknown as a series combination of resistance and reactance; a series element reduces the variation in admittance bridges that represent the unknown as a conductance and susceptance in parallel. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the applicability and limitations of this latter procedure and to describe how the crystal parameters are extracted from measurements of this type."
"The optimal solution of perturbation signal waveform used to linearize the nonlinear transfer characteristic of the receptor array for an image sensing is sought through approximation. A completely linearized characteristic is obtained for the one-dimensional square-element receptor array without dead space by introducing this optimal perturbation signal to the system. Therefore, a zero sensing error is achieved. The result is extended to linearize one-dimensional receptor arrays having specific dead space and two-dimensional receptor arrays."

"Current-transformer (CT) saturation due to primary dc transient offsets presents a problem with regard to fast and predictable operation of protective relays. In this paper, a method is devised and tested for detecting the presence of saturation by sampling the output of the current transformer every millisecond. Successive sampled values are compared and a large difference between these values is used to indicate that saturation has occurred. Results are given that show the circuit operation when actually connected to a CT that is subjected to a transient primary current. Finally, some possible applications of the saturation detector in protection and other areas are suggested."
"The condition of resonance for a signal with FM is defined in this paper as the condition of maximum power transfer by the resonant device. It is shown that if the width of the signal spectrum is small compared to the resonator's linewidth, then the frequency error is proportional to the third moment of the instantaneous signal frequency about its mean. One expects that this treatment should, at least, give the leading term for a precise treatment of atomic resonances. Experimental results with a cesium beam frequency standard confirm this expectation and add caution to the idea that higher Q atomic resonances make better absolute frequency standards."
"A voltage-controlled time-delay arrangement with a duty cycle equal to unity is described. This performance of the circuit is based on the use of a new monostable switch with complementary transistors. The monostable switch, derived from a free-running multivibrator with very small mark/space ratio is employed as the trigger time base generator, the recovery time of which is very short. Such a time base generator is suitable for various applications in the measurement instruments. Connected to the Schmitt trigger, this timing circuit is very useful in the design of wide-range time-delay arrangements. The experimental performance of the presented time-delay arrangement is as follows: the delay-time variation in one range from about one microsecond to several milliseconds; the delay time/control voltage linearity better than ± 0.15 percent for the control voltage greater than 0.5 volt; the temperature stability of about 0.2 percent in the temperature range from 25-100°C."
"The National Bureau of Standards Frequency Standard, NBS-III, a cesium beam with a 3.66-meter interaction region, has been in operation since 1963. The last published (1966) accuracy capability for NBS-III was 1.1 × 10-12(lσ). Recently, several new solid-state broad-band frequency-multiplier chains have been constructed. Reduction of the random phase noise by more than 20 dB compared to the previous state of the art has been obtained consistently. In addition, a solid-state servo system has been installed to control the frequency of the 5-MHz slave oscillator. Comparisons were made between NBS-III and one of the commercial cesium standards in the NBS clock ensemble. The relative fractional frequency stability σ(N = 2, T = 7 days, σ = 1 day) = 1 × 10-13 was observed for nine weekly comparisons. The very-long-term frequency stability for this recently improved NBS-III system has not been evaluated fully. Due to the improvements both in electronic systems and evaluative techniques, however, an accuracy of 5 × 10-13(1σ) for a single evaluative experiment is reported. Substantial effort is being expended toward improvement of the accuracy and figure of merit (presently 10) of the NBS cesium standard. The modified system, to be called NBS-5, is expected to be in operation in the latter half of 1970 and to exhibit a figure of merit in excess of 500."
"Four different direct reading ratio-error sets, capable of generating measured complex fractions of an input reference current to a nominal accuracy of 1 percent of reading for such applications as current-transformer calibration, are described and analyzed. Construction and performance details for actual sets with 3 or more digit resolution in both direct and quadrature components from 0.1 parts per million to 10 percent of input currents up to 10 amperes at 50, 60, and 400 Hz, are given."
"Measurements with a negatively pulsed probe in an atmospheric-pressure high-density plasma over wide ranges of ionization density (1015-1018/meters3), probe voltage (10-400 volts), and flow velocity (5-40 m/s) have confirmed previous results obtained by Thomas, working at a single voltage and flow velocity in which the current initially falls off with a t-y dependence where y ≈ 0.58 and t = time. The results together with those of Thomas show good agreement with a theory based on a physical model involving space-charge controlled expansion of the sheath towards its final position. It is expected that this technique of probe operation will afford a simple and sometimes unique method of measuring ionization density with excellent spatial resolution, under high-pressure conditions where the plasma velocity relative to the probe is not accurately known (for atmospheric-pressure dc measurements this factor often becomes significant with flow velocities > 0.1-1 m/s)."
"An improved bias supply for tunnel-diode (TD) picosecond-pulse generators is described. The supply is stable with temperature and, in a commercial 35-ps (nominal) risetime tunneldiode pulse generator/sampling oscilloscope system, has produced a 4:1 reduction in time-base jitter and 2:1 reduction in time-base drift. Also described is a tunnel-diode pulse generator, which, when used with the bias supply, produces a stable pulse having a flat-top sag of no more than 2 percent in 1 μs."

"The results of a joint experiment aimed primarily at the determination of the frequency of the H1 hyperfine transition (F = 1, mF = 0) ↔ (F = 0, mF = 0) is reported. In terms of the frequency of the Cs133 hyperfine transition (F = 4, mF = 0) ↔(F = 3, mF = 0), defined as 9192 631 770 Hz, for the unperturbed hydrogen transition frequency the value υH = 1420 405 751.768 Hz is obtained. This result is the mean of two independent evaluations against the same cesium reference, which differ by 2 × 10-3 Hz. We estimate the one-sigma uncertainty of the value υH also to be 2 × 10-3 Hz. One evaluation is based on wall-shift experiments at Harvard University; the other is a result of a new wall-shift measurement using many storage bulbs of different sizes at the National Bureau of Standards. The experimental procedures and the applied corrections are described. Results for the wall shift and for the frequency of hydrogen are compared with previously published values, and error limits of the experiments are discussed."
"In microwave spectroscopy and in atomic frequency standards, the atomic resonant frequency is often determied by the use of harmonic frequency modulation of a microwave signal. The effects of line asymmetry and modulating-signal nonlinear distortions are investigated by the use of an analytic approximation of the resonance line by means of an algebraic polynomial. The coefficients of the polynomial are determined experimentally and also derived theoretically. Detailed numerical results for a Ramsey resonance line in a cesium clock are given."
"The test set described here is capable of measuring the spectral density of phase noise on carrier frequencies from 1 to 500 MHz, for offset frequencies from 20 Hz to 50 kHz. Measurements to 50 MHz are described. The test set has a residual single-sideband phase-noise-power-to-signal-power ratio of -142 dB/Hz at 20 Hz offset from the carrier, which decreases to a floor of -172 dB/Hz at offset frequencies greater than 5 kHz. The estimated calibration accuracy achievable is ±0.8 dB, exclusive of random reading errors due to the Gaussian distribution of the phase fluctuations being observed. The estimated 1 σ repeatability of a measurement is 0.7 dB (70 percent of the observations on a given test will fall within ±0.7 dB of the average value). This test set is capable of characterizing the phase-noise performance of existing atomic frequency standards, crystal oscillators, frequency synthesizers, and other high-quality sources more accurately than has previously been possible. The increased accuracy has been achieved by a system design that minimizes readout fluctuations, allows for the accurate measurement of correction factors used to reduce systematic errors, and minimizes the possibility of operator error and bias."
"The Office National d'Études et de Recherches Aérospatiales has devised a method of time synchronization by what is described as \"simple overflight,\" relying on a high-precision airborne timepiece, without the need to go close to the clocks under comparison. The method has repeatedly been tested, and the results show the accuracy of synchronization to be better than 50 ns. A comparative experiment between the observatories of Paris, France, Hailsham, England, Ottawa, Canada, and Washington, D. C. will be carried out in September 1970."
"A simple technique for clock synchronization uses signals included in normal television transmissions as time markers. By use of automatic equipment built in the laboratory, it has been possible to make regular comparisons of time scales. Remote time laboratories can also be intercompared by this process. Accuracy of a fraction of a microsecond can be obtained easily. Numerical results of different experiments and comparisons with other methods are presented."
"The greatest inaccuracy in making a microwave power measurement is usually the uncertainty of the calibration factor or the effective efficiency. These terms account for the RF losses and substitution errors in the bolometric or electrothermic mount. A new method for transferring calibration from a standard mount to a mount to be calibrated has production line speed and simplicity; yet its accuracy rivals standards laboratory techniques. This method uses an automatic network analyzer to measure the quantities required and to solve the mismatch equation in transferring calibration from the standard mount to the one to be calibrated. A technique is also described to evaluate the errors of the transfer measurement. An accurate method of measuring the complex reflection coefficient of a stabilized source is another result of this work. The present implementation measures effective efficiency, calibration factor, and the magnitude and phase of the reflection coefficient of a mount at six calibration frequencies in 60 seconds. The uncertainty in transferring calibration factor and effective efficiency is about 0.5 percent."
"The theory, techniques, and apparatus that are used to perform an automatic self-certification of a computer-controlled calibration system are described. This process determines the linearity and bias deviations of the instrumentation of the system. These deviations are stored in the digital computer for subsequent use as corrections to the nominal instrument values when the system is applied to external devices. Dc measurements and stimuli, the uncertainties of which are of the order of 0.001 percent, have been achieved using this technique, exceeding the specifications normally associated with the uncorrected instrumentation. A similar reduction in uncertainty results from the self-certification process in ac voltage and resistance measurements. Using a 1-volt dc source, 1000-ohm resistor, and ac-dc thermal transfer as references, the scales of measure are automatically reestablished over a wide dynamic range in less than five minutes. Laboratory applications of this computer-controlled system have been made to classical metrology problems that include measurements of standard resistors, saturated standard cells, and resistance thermometers. Semi-automatic calibrations of test and measuring instruments have been performed to demonstrate potential productivity and accuracy."
"An automated system for Stokes parameter-polarization analysis over the HF-VHF range is described. Axial ratio, orientation angle, polarization fraction, and polarization sense are determined by amplitude measurements using a conventional fieldintensity receiver. Six amplitude measurements from four crossed nonresonant dipoles, including quadrature sum and difference, eliminate the requirement for phase measurement. The antenna does not use active components and is adaptable for mobile or stationary operation. VSWR measurements on the antenna output cables show less than 1.2:1 (50 ohms) over the 2-70 MHz range. The antenna aperture increases from 1 × 10-5 square meters at 2.0 MHz to 0.019 square meters at 70 MHz. A solid-state sequencer processes each amplitude measurement separately through the receiver and digital conversion circuits (providing BCD output) to an incremental tape recorder. The Stokes parameter analysis is performed by an off-line digital computer using the magnetic tape data. This analysis permits computation of total received power from either set of orthogonal element measurements. When combined with the measured antenna aperture, power density (or field strength) also can be derived. Polarization fraction measurements for locally controlled signals show a mean of 1.02 as compared to a theoretical value of 1.00 (standard deviation of 0.1) over the 2-70 MHz range and polarization results consistent with propagation predictions."
"Capability and accuracy of microwave measuring methods and instruments can be substantially improved by the use of general-purpose digital computers. One of the fruitful applications is concerned with redundant measurements and their evaluation. In a redundant measurement more data are measured than would be necessary for a singular evaluation and the excess information is used to reduce measurement errors. Redundant measurements are advantageous for sophisticated microwave measurements where the final results can be determined only by tedious graphical or numerical transforms of measured data. Redundant measuring methods also can be used to verify network or device models and, to determine the parameters of these models. The evaluation of redundant measurements can be carried out in simple cases by averaging and generally by fitting the hypothetical parameters to the measured data (e.g., by least-square error method) or by using integral transform (e.g., Fourier transform) techniques. Digital computers enable one to make fast and accurate evaluations."
"Dissemination of the volt is complicated by the complex temperature response of standard cells. Discribed are the design and performance characteristics of an experimental standard-cell airbath specifically optimized for transportable voltage-dissemination service. Salient features of this bath are 1) ±0.001°C control of the cell temperature in the laboratory, ±0.02°C maximum variation around 28°C in shipment; 2) exposure capacity from over 8 hours at 0°C or 45°C to over 72 hours in moderate temperatures; 3) shipping package weight 14.5 kg, size 20.3 × 22.9 × 30.5 cm; and 4) electrical power drain 0.8-0.2 watt. Cell temperature is determined primarily by an ambient-temperature-biased on-off heater system. Immunity to external environment is achieved by a unique secondary control, which employs the energy storage capacity of two heat-of-fusion alloys, which are reset simply by exposure to laboratory temperature. Experience with this bath has shown that the average value of cell voltage is reproducible to 0.1 μv within a few hours following shipment. This time delay is significantly shorter than the days-to-weeks for most air baths and the weeks-to-months for cells shipped without temperature control."
"This paper describes a highly stable, guarded dc voltage-ratio standard and the measuring network and techniques used to establish the values of its ratios to an accuracy of 0.2 ppm. The entire system is housed within a dry-air enclosure whose temperature is maintained at 23 ± 0.05°C. Discrete ratios from 1:1 to 1000:1 are provided, with maximum rated voltage set at 1000 volts. The design of the standard was chosen so that a redundancy of measurement could be incorporated in the system. Thus each successive ratio is measured by a substitution or \"bootstrap\" method and by satisfying the conditions of the series-parallel principle, the 10:1, 100:1, and 1000:1 ratios are measured by a second independent method. The design also admits additional checks on the validity of the measurements. An analysis of measurement errors and a discussion of their possible origin are included. Since the intent also was to design the ratio standard for low-frequency operation some preliminary data are included on its ac performance."
"A 10-kV stabilized supply with a dc capacity of 10 mA has been constructed. Its drift rate measured over time intervals greater than about 1 minute and extending to times of more than 10 hours is about 1 part in 107 per hour. For shorter times from 1 second to 1 minute the peak-to-peak deviation from the mean is about 2 mV at 9.2 kV or ±1 part in 107. This performance has been achieved by the use of an initially well regulated commercial 10-kV supply in a closed-loop control system. High dc loop gain has been achieved by the use of a chopper-stabilized amplifier, and a guarded resistive divider of special design. The reference voltage is made up of a bank of unsaturated standard cells enclosed in a temperature-controlled air bath whose short term temperature stability is ±0.001°C. The control resistive divider, together with a measuring divider and a guard divider, are enclosed in an oil bath whose temperature is controlled near ambient to within ±0.01°C."
"A highly stable (± 1-ppm) 500-kV power supply is being developed for use in a high-resolution (~1-Å) electron microscope. One of the critical components in such a power supply is, of course, the feedback element, which, in this case, is a resistive voltage divider. A dual 150-kV divider has been constructed to determine the stability of such devices. The dividers are compared in a guarded Wheatstone bridge circuit and appear to be stable to within a few parts in 108 when operating at 150 kV. The high-voltage section of each divider consists of 150 1-MΩ resistors."
"This instrument uses pulsewidth modulation techniques in which a crystal oscillator, frequency divider, and preset counter replace the resistive divider to form a precision potentiometer. The smoothing of the time-division intervals to a steady-state direct current without introducing prohibitive time constants is solved by a \"sectional average\" integrating circuit. This utilizes a short time-constant integrator combined with a switched unity-gain buffer amplifier in the feedback to integrator input. This switch, integrate, and sample-and-hold circuit provides output within ±0.1 percent of the eventual steady-state value in less than 400 ms after a step change and within ±0.001 percent in 600 ms. The system provides digital compatibility with tape, cards, digital voltmeters, etc. An engineering prototype has 7 decade dials covering a 0-100.0000-volt range with ±(0.1 ppm + 5μV) voltage-ratio accuracy and, ±0.05 ppm/50°C temperature coefficient and ±0.05 ppm/ 10-week long-term stability, and it is expected that this may be improved."
"The design, construction, and performance of a dc bridge that covers the complete range of both platinum-and germanium-resistance thermometry in four ranges, 0-11 up to 0-11 000 ohms, is described. The bridge uses a potentiometric method based on the current comparator. In the design, emphasis has been placed on reducing the noise level, on obtaining a single-balance operation, and on providing a recorder output. Detector sensitivity and noise level (with a three-second time constant) permit full eight-decade bridge resolution to be achieved at a thermometer current of I mA on all ranges except the lowest, which requires 5 mA. Bridge errors are believed to be less than 10-7 of a reading or one step on the last dial, whichever is larger. A facility is provided for measuring the self-heating effect of the thermometer, even if the measured temperature is not constant. The bridge is also suitable for the measurement of four-terminal standard resistors over the same ranges."
"A new horizontal cross capacitor was constructed to achieve higher accuracy in the determination of absolute capacitance values. To eliminate some major causes of the uncertainty that had been found in the earlier capacitor, the bars were finished more precisely and new mechanisms were adopted. These are a fine adjusting mechanism for alignment of the bars and a supporting mechanism of the bars that prevents them from bending because of gravity. A nonrotating guard-tube driving mechanism was used. The bars could be aligned within 0.1 pm or less. The alignment was inspected with capacitance-type electronic micrometers. The bending dip of the bars was estimated to be negligibly small. The uncertainty in the absolute determination of 0.2 pF with this capacitor is estimated to be of the order of 10-7."
"New instruments have been designed to bring to standards laboratories the improved accuracy of capacitor calibrations developed by the National Bureau of Standards. The new 10-and 100-pF reference standard capacitors, based upon an NBS design, use a fused-silica dielectric with gold electrodes to provide the time and voltage stability required for calibrations to parts in 107. To maintain the capacitor temperature constant to within 0.01 °C, one model of the capacitors is designed for use in an oil bath, the other model is fitted with a new, stable, thermostatically controlled air bath. The system to measure these capacitors with a precision of parts in 108 consists of a bridge, detector, and oscillator. For these special measurements and for the general calibration of a wide range of capacitors, the new transformer-ratio-arm bridge has 12 capacitance decades and a range of 10 MAF-10-7 pF, and five conductance decades and a range of 103110-10 tmho. The new phasesensitive detector and power oscillator provide high sensitivity to bridge imbalance over the frequency range 10 Hz-100 kHz."
"A transfonner-ratio-arm bridge is described that combines the high sensitivity of equal-power bridges with the immunity from lead errors of ac bridges analogous to the Kelvin double bridge. The latter apply either equal current or voltage to both impedances being compared and suffer a reduction in sensitivity when the impedance ratio is high, while the sensitivity of bridges that apply equal power (or voltamperes) to both impedances is independent of this ratio. The new bridge has two transformers in addition to the two of the usual equal-power bridge to reduce lead-impedance errors. Two current loops are formed around each of the two impedances being compared making four-terminal connections to both. The auxiliary transformers couple between loops on the two sides of the bridge and act to maintain accurate current and voltage ratios in spite of series impedance. The expression for the error due to lead impedance is given and is compared with those for other four-terminal bridges and with measured results. A lead-impedance-balance procedure is given that reduces lead errors still further."
"A high-precision isolated-section inductive divider, designed for self-calibration, has been developed. In this new design principle, the two major sources of ratio error, excitation current and current through stray capacitance between sections of divider windings, have been greatly reduced by the use of a separate excitation winding and a guard for the divider winding. In a self-calibration divider ten divider winding sections are electrostatically isolated from each other by their guards. The divider can be calibrated by internal exchange of the winding sections and comparison with an auxiliary divider having a fixed nominal ratio of 0.1, similar to the calibration of a resistive divider. The design principle is also applied to another divider in which a second winding is added. This divider can be used for a high-precision multidecade divider and for the calibration of other ininductive dividers using a \"boot-strapping\" method. Construction details of the dividers, sources of errors, results of self-calibration, and evaluation of uncertainties are presented. The uncertainties of the self-calibration are estimated to be ±3 X 10-9 of the input at 100 Hz to 1 kHZ, and ±30 X 10-9 at 10 kHz."
"A unique new type of RF ammeter is described. The ammeter combines broad frequency coverage with broad current range and is designed for use in a 50-ohm coaxial transmission line. The ammeter consists of an elliptic-cylinder silver reflector of infrared energy with a cylindrical thick-film heater along one focus and a heat-sensing thermopile along the other focus. Advantages over older ammeter designs include a shielded construction with inherent electrical isolation between the RF and dc circuits, a large dc output (approximately 1-100 mV) corresponding to a decade dynamic range (0.25-2.5 amperes), and a frequency range from dc to about 1 GHz. This coaxial ammeter is believed to be the first to have very low standing-wave ratio (SWR) (1.03) in a 50-ohm transmission line. Ammeters of lower current range can be built, but at a penalty of increased SWR due to the larger heater resistance required."
"The Bolovac is a novel device for the standardization and measurement of TEM voltage, current, and power from below 1 MHz through 18 GHz (potentially through 36 GHz). It can be used for attentuation measurement and as a superior impedance termination at all the above-mentioned frequencies. To date it is the first and only practical means of calibrating microwave current indicators and of evaluating oscilloscopes displaying 25-ps or shorter risetime pulses. It is felt that application of the Bolovac will radically improve power measurements. It reduces the problems arising from mismatch-error uncertainties, one of the major present sources of concem in power measurement; measurement of complex reflection coefficients; complex computations; use of error-limit charts; and measurement of effective efficiency and calibration factors. Its application should radically increase optimum accuracy and measurement-time efficiency in calibration facilities outside the National Bureau of Standards. The Bolovac together with an RF generator can be used as a source of known voltage. It can also be used as an absorption power meter. It needs no RF calibration. It has a range as high as 40 dB depending on the desired precision and on whether one or more sensors (special bolometric disks) are used. Voltages down to 0.1 volt with accuracies of 0.5 percent and better (and corresponding power in 50-ohm systems) have been measured. The paper describes the general features and application of the Bolovac and lists references to more comprehensive papers on the subject."
"Immittance-measuring facilities have been developed that yield high accuracy over a wide immittance range at frequencies up to 20 MHz. The achievement of accuracy at high frequencies required that the errors resulting from residual immittances be kept small, which in turn required development work in bridge design, calibration techniques, measurement methods, and the intercomparison of measurement results. These activities included the design and calibration of unity-ratio admittance bridges, the use of additional circuitry with these bridges to measure small impedances, and the modeling of the impedances of small-valued inductors. Examples of the resulting accuracies for the values assigned to high-Q inductors are at 1 MHz, approximately ± t(0.1 percent+0.5 nH) in inductance and ±(0.01 Q percent+0.3 mQ) in resistance for 50-nH to 100-μH inductors; and at 10 MHz, ±0.5 percent in inductance and ±0.5 Q percent in resistance for 0.5-μH to 3 IH inductors."
"A new lumped-circuit directional coupler is described for the 1-30 MHz frequency range. Directivity greater than 50 dB is achieved over this frequency range for coupling ratios of 30, 40, and 50 dB. Greater directivity can be achieved over a narrower frequency range, and the coupler can be tuned for essentially infinite directivity at a fixed frequency. The couplers, although resistive, can pass 100, 300, or 1000 watts for the coupling ratios of 30, 40, and 50 dB, respectively, with less than a 0.01-dB change in coupling ratio. The coupling ratios are constant with frequency to ±0.25 dB. Equations and curves are given for obtaining component values needed to design a resistive-divider-type coupler with any coupling from 3 to 60 dB."
"Although the use of noise figure or noise temperature to characterize amplifier performance is a well-established practice, it is also recognized that this parameter provides only a partial description of the amplifier noise properties. In general, the noise figure (or temperature) depends upon the generator impedance and is thus a function of the signal-source and amplifier combination. Typically, the noise figure is measured by the Y-factor method using hot and cold noise sources that are nominally matched (reflectionless). The result of this measurement is of value as a figure of merit; however, if optimum performance is to be realized, the applications engineer must know whether to adjust the signal source impedance for maximum power transfer, minimum noise figure, or some other criterion, and he must know the deterioration in performance that results if this is not done. It is the purpose of this paper to present an alternative method of characterizing amplifier noise performance in terms of parameters that provide ready answers to these questions. In addition, the measurement of these parameters via a simple extension of the Y-factor method will be described."
"Variation of insertion loss with connect-disconnect cycles was measured for mated pairs of the following types of connectors: GPC-14 [3], GPC-7 [3], type N, and SMA. Two versions of each of the type N and SMA connectors were tested versus life at intervals of 2500 connect-disconnect cycles over a total of 10 000 operations. Measurements were made with a resolution of 0.0001 dB between 2 and 18 GHz. The variations expressed in the standard deviation cr ranged for new connectors from σ <0.002 dB on the best to a maximum of 0.008 dB and increased as much as three times after 10 000 connections. Some causes of the increase are considered for the different connectors."
"A 70-GHz microwave phase-measuring system, capable of detecting small as well as multiradian phase changes, is described. The use of programmable, digital dividing circuits permits phase changes of up to 20 π radians to be measured without ambiguity. A 2μs rise time of system output permits rapid phase changes to be detected. The output voltage, which is directly proportional to phase change, can also be monitored by a digital voltmeter or a chart recorder for long time measurements. Signal limiting makes the measurement relatively insensitive to a 20-dB change in microwave signal level."
"A precision slotted-line measurement system is described that provides rapid impedance measurements over a wide dynamic range for both active and passive devices. Phase accuracy of 0.1° at 7.0 GHz and magnitude accuracy of 0.5 percent are obtainable for high VSWR measurements. Phase-locked sources used for both the slotted-line drive and the receiver local oscillator provide greater than 70 dB of dynamic range for an incident power level of -50 dBm at the unknown. A micrometer positioner for the slotted-line probe provides an order of magnitude improvement in probe-position accuracy over that obtainable using the conventional slotted-line scale and micrometer. A computer program simulates the slotted line and its associated connector by several sections of lossy transmission line together with appropriate discontinuity capacitance and contact loss. This form of model has the advantage that frequency dependence is implicitly included. Impedance measurement is simple and rapid. The only data required are the frequency, the position of an unknown null, either the width of the minimum or the VSWR, and the desired reference plane extension. The corrected data may be plotted directly on a Smith chart. Printout is in a convenient format for data evaluation."
"The measurement of high reflection coefficients is rather difficult. Several methods have been described for this purpose, mostly using slotted-line techniques. The knowledge of the reflection coefficient of standard waveguide short-circuits is especially useful when the reflectometer method is used for impedance measurements. In this case the error due to the non-ideal behavior of the reference short circuit is one of the most important factors that influence the accuracy of the measurement. The paper analyzes several methods of measurement with particular consideration to sources of error. Special reference is made to a calorimetric method that is capable of high accuracy. Some experimental results obtained on standard λ/4 short circuits fabricated at the Istituto Elettrotecnico Nazionale (Turin, Italy) are shown and compared with calculated values found in the literature."
"The design of an electromagnetic survey meter is discussed together with an analysis of the errors associated with near-field measurements. The meter provides accurate measurements of near-field radiation emanating from leaking microwave power devices at 915 and 2450 MHz such as consumer ovens and industrial heating devices. Measurements are not subject to polarization of the incident wave, ambient temperature, or infrared radiation. Fail-safe indications are provided in the event of damage to the sensor. The range of measurements is from 10 μW/cm2 to 200 mW/cm2."
"The perturbation method is most suitable for the experimental determination of electromagnetic field patterns in closed regions. The analysis of Slater's theorem proves that systematic errors as well as method errors committed while determining relative field distributions are of the order of 1 percent or less if the volume of the perturbing element, for instance a thin metal needle, is of the order of 10-6 - 10-7 of the resonator volume. In this case the corresponding change in the resonant frequency is of the order 10-4 - 10-5. In order to achieve high precision of measurements, a sensitive phase-equilibrium bridge and a digital frequency counter were used. Two problems have been discussed in this paper. The first concerns the experimental-mathematical method for the determination of the field pattern, which consists of measuring the field distribution in the plane of the iris and obtaining the field pattern in the whole resonator through analysis of the measured distribution. Using this method the field distributions of the H1,0,1 mode rectangular resonator with an iris were investigated and the congruity of the calculated results with the experimental ones was within a few percent. The other problem concerns the design of equivalent circuits for resonators with heterogeneities. On the basis of the known field distribution an equivalent circuit of the rectangular resonator in the H1,0,1 mode with a capacitive post was developed. With given geometrical dimensions, it was possible to calculate the resonant frequency with an accuracy of a few percent."
"In this paper a method is presented for determining the complex permittivity and permeability of linear materials in the frequency domain by a single time-domain measurement; typically, the frequency band extends from VHF through X band. The technique described involves placing an unknown sample in a microwave TEM-mode fixture and exciting the sample with a subnanosecond baseband pulse. The fixture is used to facilitate the measurement of the forward- and back-scattered energy, s21(t) and s11(t), respectively. It is shown in this paper that the forward- and back-scattered time-domain \"signatures\" are uniquely related to the intrinsic properties of the materials, namely, ϵ* and μ*. By appropriately interpreting s21(t) and s11(t), one is able to determine the real and imaginary parts of ϵ and μ as a function of frequency. Experimental results are presented describing several familiar materials."
"This paper describes a method for generating fractional nanosecond pulsed waveforms of known shape thereby providing an a priori means for establishing reference waveform generators or standards to be used in pulsed measurements and other applications. The method employs the band-limiting properties of a lossy uniform transmission line to produce a known waveform and generator impedance. A theory for generator characterization and application is presented that defines a given generator in terms of time-domain or frequency-domain functions. A new term called the \"available\" waveform is defined. Rms error is employed as the error criteria. An example of generator design is given that employs planar skin-effect loss and provides an output response having 0.2 percent rms error over the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 600 ps referred to the inherent step response of the waveshaping line. The input transition generator is assumed to be a 30-ps unit ramp generator. Also, an application example is given that employs a reference waveform generator to evaluate a sampling oscilloscope. The reference waveform generator uses a Debye dielectric lossy transmission line. The rms error of the oscilloscope time-domain response is determined as a function of time."
"Conventional sampling techniques yield minimum risetime in the oscillography of repetitive electrical waveforms. However, system timing uncertainties introduce drift and jitter errors, which are typically comparable in magnitude to the cathode-ray-oscilloscope risetime. By using two sampling oscilloscopes in cascade it is possible to reduce the drift by a factor of 10-3, down to a level of 10-14 seconds (during an averaging and recording time interval of 2 minutes). Successive sampling also allows accurate jitter filtering. With the aid of a tunnel-diode step generator the total system has a 10-90 percent risetime of 25 X 10-12 second, a step response that is closely integral Gaussian, a time-measurement uncertainty of about 10-13 second, and amplitude accuracy of 0.2 percent. Absolute time calibration is possible with a 3 X 10-14-second resetting capability. Applications include the measurement of the impulse-response functions of coaxial two-port networks in the 10-11-second range. Finally, it is shown that amplitude averaging of a sampled waveform with time jitter causes convolution error and loss of resolution."
"Use of the Kerr electrooptical effect for time-resolved pulse measurements is extended to the 300-kV level. Pulse durations are as short as 5 μs. The performance of systems equipped with Kerr cells of various designs is investigated under a variety of operating conditions. Calibrations are achieved using both pulse-divider and high direct-voltage techniques. Methods are devised for measurement and correction of errors resulting from the fringing electric field at the ends of the Kerr-cell electrodes. Measurements of the temperature coefficient of the Kerr-cell constant are also included. The pulse waveform is reconstructed from typical Kerr-system results by automatic computation and compared with simultaneous time-resolved pulse-divider measurements. Comparisons at the peak of the pulse, where a \"slideback\" technique is used to enhance the resolution of the divider measurement, demonstrate agreement to better than 1 percent. In addition, a novel technique is developed for measurement of the pulse magnitude from photographs of the Kerr-effect fringe patterns produced by passing an expanded, pulsed laser beam through the system. By this approach, voltage is measured optically without use of sophisticated electrical metering instrumentation."
"Current stringent demands for high-accuracy measurements in low-noise technology have created a need for cryogenic noise standards, usually of liquid refrigerant type. However, implementation of this type of standard in large earth stations imposes problems where measurements must be performed for arbitrary antenna inclination angle and during active communication phase between a satellite and an earth station. A cryogenic noise standard utilizing helium gas refrigerant has been developed, installed, and made operative for continuous operation with minimal maintenance service without the aforementioned constraints."
"Nuclear spin systems follow the Curie law down to far below 1 mK and can provide an accurate standard of temperature below 0.5 K. Pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques are used to measure the susceptibility to an accuracy of one part in one thousand in a copper sample below 4.2 K. The method has been found experimentally to be useful down to 25 mK; the theoretical limit is much lower."
"Microwave instrumentation is being developed to measure densities and flow rates of nitrogen or hydrogen in either the single-phase liquid state or the liquid-solid (slush) state. The dielectric behavior exhibited by these fluids is the basis for using microwave systems for the measurement. These methods can also be applied to the measurement of fluids at ordinary temperatures. The three density instrumentation techniques discussed here require that the microwave signal be propagated through a column of cryogenic fluid (from the top to the bottom of a cryostat, for example). All of the fluid in the column influences the behavior of the microwave signal, thus the sample is representative of the fluids at all levels within the cryostat. A Doppler flowmeter is also discussed. Its main advantages are that no moving mechanical parts are involved and no probe need be installed in the flow stream. The flowmeter may give simultaneous density and velocity measurements so that the mass flow rate can be determined."

"The design of an educational system to develop design capabilities in young graduate engineers is described. The system emphasizes the concepts of design, the application of engineering theory, interdisciplinary fundamentals, design problems, and an actual finished design project. The effectiveness of the system was evaluated using creativity tests, self-administered attitude questionnaires, and peer ratings. A control group of peers was matched with the system group to provide a measure of relative improvement. Exposure to the system developed factors in the students that are exhibited by experienced design engineers."
"An experiment with a low-cost \"teaching machine\" is described and evaluated from the standpoint of effectiveness in an electrical engineering course given to practicing engineers at their plant. In the new teaching method the instructor is not present at two of the three weekly sessions. The method replaced a 3-hour session held once each week and was found to be more effective and convenient for the students. When compared with television systems, its advantages are low cost, ease of recording the lectures, and freedom of scheduling. Both the equipment required to conduct the course and the operation of the in-plant and corresponding oncampus classes are described. A thorough evaluation by the two groups of students and the instructor is presented, and situations in which the teaching method is useful are discussed."
"The problem of stimulating interest and creativity in an introductory multisection laboratory course is a formidable obstacle when it is taught semester after semester. A method of cooperative instruction involving all laboratory instructors in the presentation during the lecture period is reported. Additional means for stimulating student interest and creativity are also outlined."
"A case study of an undergraduate research project is presented. The account is written from two points of view, one of the student and one of the professor. It describes the authors' individual and personal experiences before, during, and after the project. Some of the technical aspects of the project are included, but the primary emphasis is on the values to be received from participating in an undergraduate research experience."
"The growing interest in the United Kingdom in educational technology is reflected in the creation of a number of new organizations. The present interest in some devices is outlined; the author describes the rise and fall of programmed instruction, the reasons why early hopes were not realized, and the lessons to be derived. An educational television service and the Open University, both the world's largest systems of their kind, are described. Many teachers are reluctant to accept educational technology; this might be overcome by introducing teachers to the technique in a teaching situation, through local \"workshops,\" the use of audiovisual aids in selected educational establishments, and instruction in the management of equipment. This will require industry's cooperation."
"The National Study of Mathematics Requirements for Scientists and Engineers is concerned with establishing the best mathematics course selection for the many specializations in science and engineering, such as organic chemistry or electrical engineering. An Instruction and Course Content Sheet and a Course Recommendation Form were sent to over 9000 scientists and engineers. They recommended courses for the Ph.D. in their specialization and filled in additional information concerning their age, place of employment, and orientation of work. Forty mathematics courses were selected by the consultants; and the respondents rated each course on length, level, applied-theoretic orientation, their knowledge and use of the course. Those selected for the study were all nationally known specialists or were very productive in reporting research to the major professional journals. Some of the general conclusions of the study were as follows. 1) Mathematics courses should have a fifty percent emphasis on theory and fifty percent emphasis on application. 2) There were few recommendations for courses such as the functional analysis sequence, modern algebra sequence, and mathematical logic. 3) High recommendations were for applied courses such as vectors, the many types of differential equations, matrix theory, and machine computation. 4) Comparisons of categories within each specialization showed little differences in recommendations for most specializations. However, applied electrical engineers used much less mathematics than those who were theoretically oriented."
"The lack of sufficient formal education in the field of reliability is an accepted fact by both the engineering educator and reliability manager. This paper describes this problem in some detail and contrasts the state of reliability education with other more established disciplines. Some of the previous ambitious attempts to remedy this situation are discussed and some more limited and perhaps more feasible suggestions are presented."
"An elementary analysis of the difference amplifier is presented in this paper in a form that is easily understood by undergraduates. Basic operation of the amplifier, the significance of the \"common-mode rejection ratio,\" the maximum allowable input signal level, and the use of \"balancing resistors\" in the emitter circui'ts are the principal topics covered. In addition, a practical difference amplifier using balancing collector-coupled transistors is analyzed."
"This paper presents a method for realizing sampled-data compensators for discrete control systems. A canonical representation that requires a minimum number of delay elements is selected for the realization of sampled-data compensation functions. A hybrid implementation of this canonical form is presented that uses analog elements for multiplication and summation, and digital elements for storage (time delay). The hybrid controller is programmed to compensate two sampled-data systems. For one system (an accelerometer control loop), open-loop frequency characteristics of the hybrid controller are displayed along with time domain curves of the closed-loop system performance."
"A computer program is presented that is intended primarily as a teaching aid for the design of transmission networks. It permits the student to select intuitively a set of reflection zeros or natural modes and attenuation poles and to evaluate several selected performances as the result of this selection."
"Time-domain matrix methods coupled with convenient linear transformations are used to obtain expressions for the winding currents of a synchronous machine subjected to a symmetrical three-phase short circuit. For the case of a rotor having two windings in quadrature, the system matrix eigenvalues are found in terms of winding-time constants. For this particular machine, the nature of the short-circuit modes and the relationship between them is demonstrated and the effect on these modes of winding-parameter variations is examined."
"Through use of vertex matrices and a path inversion-induced duality between paths and loops, it is shown that the work of finding additional graph formulas from a given formula can often be reduced."
"A series solution approach to solving partial-differential equations can be based on difference-differential equations. The approach is explained and used to obtain an analytic solution in examples. Computational methods can be used to obtain a finite number of the series coefficient functions, and hence an approximate solution. The concepts of this paper should be of interest in classes in computer applications, simulation, and hybrid computation."
"The numerical integration of discontinuous functions is best carried out by integrating each continuous portion of the integrand separately. Through the use of a simple example, it is demonstrated that integrating through a discontinuity (by blindly applying a standard technique such as Simpson's rule) increases the computation time and the sensitivity to round-off error."
"In this paper the transmission-line equations and their solutions are presented in terms of Fourier transforms. This approach is particularly useful in presenting transmission lines to undergraduates, yet provides a tool that can handle any load and source impedance with any Fourier transformable waveform."
"In the analysis of transmission-line transients, it is customary to assume a frequency-dependent distributed-parameter transmission line and to approximate the propagation constant as a rational function in order to simplify an otherwise complicated analysis. This paper focuses on the validity of these approximations and derives some definite conclusions."
"Circuits that provide a transient and steady-state measure of slip and speed for rotating machines are described. A basic stroboscope consisting of very few components, all solid state, is also described and this can be used for the measurement, under steady conditions, of synchronous machine load-angle, of speed, and also, to a limited extent, of slip. The circuit designs are modular in character and where possible integrated circuits have been used, so that students may reasonably be able to understand not only the principle of the equipment but also, when educationally desirable, something of the circuitry as well. A further objective in developing these measuring devices has been simplicity of construction and economy of components so that multiple facilities can be provided for power teaching laboratories at a minimal cost."
"This paper presents a simple derivation of the general form of impulse responses corresponding to strictly band-limited networks, showing that all such responses must decay in an oscillatory manner."
"Instantaneous switching off of magnetic fields usually involves some analytical problems concerning the instant t= 0. It is shown that this is due to the fact that disrupted electromagnetic circuits are systems with \"a half degree of freedom.\" The correct answers are obtained only if the displacement current is taken into account, although its absolute value is negligible in conductors."

"Although not its main purpose, this paper takes issue with certain criticisms of the \"Goals of Engineering Education\" report. The main thrust of this paper is, assuming that the general goals are sufficiently well established within the minds of most engineering educators, to develop specific methods for improving education rather than to further refine and distill our definitions. Two specific suggestions are offered in this paper: one in the area of professional education and one in the area of general liberal studies. These are not completely definitive and it is hoped that this paper will serve to stimulate further dialog in the pages of this TRANSACTIONS relating to many aspects of engineering education."
"The course and laboratory discussed in this paper offer students an opportunity to gain realistic experience in the engineering of digital computers. The laboratory provides a sufficient number of logic elements to allow students to construct general purpose digital computers of modest design; only a few assemblies of fixed design are provided. The course progresses from work with basic combinational and sequential circuits through the design and testing of digital subsystems, to a project in which groups of students are challenged to specify, design, test, program, and demonstrate their digital computer. Two years of experience indicate that students are willing to enthusiastically expend a great deal of effort to meet this challenge."
"Over the last few years an integrated circuit fabrication laboratory intended primarily for use by undergraduates has been developed within the School of Electrical Engineering at Purdue University. Operating under the principle that integrated circuit design and laboratory practice are inseparable, the main objective was to allow the undergraduate student to acquire a working knowledge of how transistors, thin- and thick-film circuits, MOS field-effect transistors, and integrated circuits are fabricated. The emphasis is on how to fabricate the device in the laboratory and then to evaluate the device both electrically and metallurgically. This paper describes in detail how a device laboratory was organized for undergraduates with a minimal background in experimental technique."
"The construction details of a simple, inexpensive television system that permits display of any waveform produced on a conventional 5-inch oscilloscope are described. The system requires no electrical connections to the oscilloscope whose waveform is to be displayed, and is limited in bandwidth, sensitivity, and versatility only by the 5-inch oscilloscope employed."
"The choice of media for instruction or communication will be influenced by its potential for stimulus recognition, this being an essential part of the perception of the message. Audio stimuli and audio stimuli with visual reinforcement from television are considered, and the conclusion drawn from tests performed is that the visual reinforcement has a considerable beneficial effect. Tests involving repeated stimuli and the recognition of stimuli in the company of other subjects are also described. Again the conclusion is drawn that both conditions of stimulus presentation have a beneficial effect on correct placement scores for recognition."
"A novel approach for undergraduate teaching is proposed in which the instructor will meet the students for a three-credit-hour course only one hour a week to discuss and interact with each other instead of giving the monolog-type of lectures. The new approach has many potential advantages. Theoretically it should benefit the students and the instructors, as well as the college administrations. Should the new approach prove successful, it will have far reaching effects on many levels of education: the university undergraduate classes, the technical institutions, the junior and community colleges, the cooperative programs, and the continuous education programs as well as high school teachings. It may also help to solve the staffing problem of many black studies departments."
"Linear graph theory has received wide application in electrical network theory. This paper extends the well-known methods of network analysis by exploiting the linear relationship between current and carrier density that exists in the lumped (large-signal) model of the bipolar transistor. The lumped model is described briefly and a linear graph is drawn for the lumped model. Relations between the trees and two-trees of this graph and the incrementals α, Ico, and Ieo are then derived. A lumped model for a double emitter transistor is also considered and its graph is drawn. Linear graphs are then used to determine the lumped parameters of a and reverse currents for two conditions: 1) emitter one as the input and emitter two open circuited and 2) emitter one as the input and emitter two shorted. Each condition leads to its own graph which may then be used to find the applicable a and reverse currents. Methods for determining the circuit parameters are fully outlined and some sample calculations are given."
"It has been found that, for linear networks, both Thevenin's and Norton's theorems are special cases of the compensation theorem. To illustrate the interdependence of these network theorems, Thevenin's theorem is proved using the compensation theorem. Norton's theorem can be derived by using a dual form of the compensation theorem."
"Particularly in the field of control systems, a large amount of computation is required for analysis or synthesis of even very simple systems. Most all electrical engineers vividly remember the effort required for hand computation of the transient response of a third-or fourth-order system driven by some polynomial or trigonometric function. The advent of high-speed, low-cost computers with FORTRAN compilers promises relief for virtually all engineering undergraduates, if they desire it. A \"one-time\" effort is required to write a computer program, probably in FORTRAN, which will automatically compute the information required for linear system analysis or synthesis. Here, the computer computation of the time domain response of linear systems is discussed in some detail. The technique used is that of state space or state variable analysis. The concepts are not difficult and are quite appealing due to their generality."
"An ancient \"chestnut\" of circuit theory is the energy discrepancy associated with the switching of a charged ideal capacitor. It is suggested that the problem of interest should instead be that of an ideal capacitor structure, for which a field analysis results always in energy conservation and is of practical significance."
"The United States Military Academy at West Point, N. Y., has used a time-shared computer system in support of the academic program since 1965. The requirement has existed, however, for a highly flexible, portable access terminal-one more portable than the bulky communication or video units normally labeled as portable. It was felt that a terminal that could be used in any classroom or auditorium where the students could view both input and output would be far more suitable to the teaching environment. Such a terminal would allow instructors at West Point to use computers for reinforcement of teaching points and as a medium of demonstration. This requirement has been met through the integration of a PDP-8/I, a DF-32, and a video-display generator with the time share system and the instructional television system. Now the only equipment that has to be moved into the classrooms is a keyboard-entry device built into a 22-, by 16-, by 5-inch case. Since each classroom and auditorium has receivers placed to cover a maximum audience, the input and output is distributed via the instructional television system (ITV). The system is now fully operational. For in-class instructional support, it has proven itself an extremely flexible means of gaining access to the time-share system."
"A difficulty in applying scalar Kirchhoff diffraction theory to the individual components of the vector electromagnetic field is pointed out. For example, the method, if applied incorrectly, does not account for the cross-polarized radiation from a circumferential slot on a cylindrical structure."
"Return difference and sensitivity with respect to a parameter can be easily evaluated when the first power of the parameter occurs as a unique branch transmittance. The method has been extended to cases when the parameter and its higher powers occur as transmittances in more than one branch."
"An important problem in the design of a closed-loop control system is the selection of an open-loop system gain to match an allowable damping ratio. This paper presents an analytical method for determining the open-loop gain for a given damping ratio. A derivation of the method, a few points of note in the computer program, and some numerical examples are discussed."
"Analysis of the stability of amplifier circuits by the method of examining the signs of the input and output resistances is often beset with pitfalls, compared to other methods of stability analysis. Some representative instances are quoted from the literature and the precautionary measures to be taken are stressed."
"Some pedagogical aspects pertaining to the algorithms that are used to compute the discrete Fourier and the Hadamard transforms are considered. Elementary matrix partitioning techniques are used to illustrate the manner in which these algorithms work and how they are related. It is felt that this approach can be used to good advantage to introduce the student to this class of algorithms before proceding with more rigorous developments."
"Taylor expansions and subsequent arrangement in linear simultaneous-equation form lead to matrices for the numerical application of the bilinear transformation z=(s+1)/(s-1). The matrices are somewhat similar to those previously reported, but the proof seems more adaptable to the classroom."
"Closed-form expressions for various powers m periodic nonsinusoidal steady state are derived, and conditions insuring their existence are given. These powers are related to the class of powers possessing conservation properties-the generalized powers-and it is shown that of all powers defined in the nonsinusoidal steady state, only active power and reactive power are generalized powers."
"A recently established undergraduate microwave laboratory at the University of Massachusetts is playing an important role in the instruction of electromagnetic and microwave theory. The laboratory, which includes many modem instruments, permits students to work with state of the art equipment in performing planned laboratory exercises and special projects. The use of sophisticated microwave equipment allows the students the opportunity of learning measurement techniques that are presently being used in industry and research. In addition to increasing the students' interest in microwave theory and techniques, the new laboratory has increased the teaching efficiency by reducing the time spent performing tedious and repetitious tasks."

 "In recent years, much effort has been expended in trying to adapt the computer to the education field. Under the title computer-assisted instruction (CAI), many research projects have designed systems to assist in teaching a wide variety of subjects. Although experiences appear to be broad, the effectiveness of CAI is not clear. In addition, almost all researchers have avoided the question of cost and hence practicality of using CAI. A comprehensive survey of the CAI field, in addition to an outline of the application of CAI to a police departnent, is presented."
"The Arizona remote teaching system (ARTS) provides an inexpensive means of teaching regular college courses wherever and whenever desired. ARTS is described in terms of its three component subsystems: the manuscript generator, reproduction equipment, and playback equipment. The unique record and local playback features of the manuscript generator are emphasized. These features, along with the short programming time required, greatly facilitate the production of software. Different modes and uses of playback equipment are also discussed in some detail. Past, present, and future uses of this remote teaching system are described."
"A low-cost educational tool involving the use of cassette tape players and accompanying visual material to provide lectures on demand is described. The advantages and limitations of this tool as well as some operating experiences are discussed."
"The oral communication needs of contemporary engineers show a definite desire for training in technical speaking. Project reports, professional meetings, and oral briefings are integral to the engineer's work. Since most colleges and universities do not offer the specialized training that engineers need in this area, industry itself is called upon to implement such courses. Tektronix, Inc., of Beaverton, Ore., has taken this course of action. In the \"oral briefing\" course we attempted to do several things: 1) discuss the principles underlying effective oral communication; 2) conduct in-class oral briefing practices; 3) critique the oral efforts of the class members. As a result of this first course, additional classes are now being taught and others are being planned for the future."
"By using driving point impedance (DPI) techniques a systematic approach to the analysis of electronic circuits can be developed which helps the engineer gain insight into circuit action. The answers, representing the circuit's currents, voltages, gains, and driving-point impedances, are written down by inspection of the original circuit diagram without resorting to equivalent circuits of flow graphs. The resulting answers are in a most simple form which can be easily interpreted by inexperienced persons since the relative magnitude of each factor is known. Thus, the student rapidly obtains a \"feel\" for electronic circuits. The method can also be used to complement a computer-aided circuit design and analysis. A tutorial treatment of the fundamental methods is presented and two examples are given. The simple example, which is complex by ordinary standards, has five input signals and three active elements; yet the output signal voltage is written out by inspection with each step explained. The second example, a two-stage transistor feedback amplifier, is used to demonstrate how the fundamental concepts are applied to complex feedback circuits. The gain, input impedance, and output impedance of the feedback amplifier are found and approximations are used to compare the answers to ordinary solutions given for such amplifiers. The answers obtained by DPI analysis methods are also compared to equivalent answers found by node analysis."
"Electromechanics, not in the confined traditional sense, but rather as the broader subject of interactions between mechanical media and electromagnetic fields, represents an opportunity for teaching both mechanics and electromagnetic field theory to electrical engineering undergraduates. Over the past six years, text material, films, and demonstrations have been developed at M.I.T. for an undergraduate course which, in a fundamental way, serves the diversity of interests held by electrical engineers: interests that range from rotating machines to plasmas and from control systems to image processing techniques. A sumnmary is given of the philosophy, content, and organization of the course with emphasis given to \"threads of continuity\" and motivational material. The observations are made with the benefit of discussions from a workshop sponsored by the National Science Foundation, and held in the sunmmer of 1968. This workshop brought together interested faculty for discussions related to a course of the type described."
"The following paper describes the use of a simple FORTRAN computer program that may be used to determine course grades. The program is based on processing a set of IBM punched data cards. Each card contains the name of a student and all of his grades, including the final examination grade. The program may also be used to predict the final examination grade, based on previous quiz grades, and then, in turn, to predict the final course grade. It is thus possible to use this program periodically throughout the entire semester in order to provide the student, as well as the instructor, with a measure of his progress."

 "This paper describes an industrial training program designed to bring continuing engineering educational programs to several thousand engineers, distributed in plants over a wide geographical area, on a flexible time schedule, using a practicing engineer's time effectively and efficiently, while utilizing good teaching and learning techniques. Using video tape as the teaching media and supplementing this with textbooks, especially developed studying guide materials, visual aids designed for TV presentations, and an associate instructor at the plant location to act in a resource capacity, a successful engineering personnel educational program has been developed economically that can be used at any plant location. The techniques described could be utilized by other industries to bring quality engineering updating programs to the majority of their engineers and by universities to bring graduate-level programs to locations distant from the campus at a time convenient to the engineers involved."
"A sophomore laboratory project of growing a piezoelectric crystal for use in the construction of a loudspeaker is described. This project was quite successful in stimulating student interest and imagination and also has the advantages of being inexpensive and requiring only standard laboratory equipment."
"The thin-film and thick-film technology of fabricating hybrid integrated circuits has become of increasing importance as requirements for precision components, such as in active filters and digital to analog converters, are imposed on present circuit designs. This paper describes a series of experiments used to demonstrate this technology at the undergraduate level. The main objective of these experiments was to allow the undergraduate student to acquire a working knowledge of how the two hybrid integrated circuits were fabricated. A secondary objective was to allow him to evaluate the two techniques in terms of the equipment used and the electrical results obtained. In addition, the equipment and techniques used for monolithic I-C fabrication were introduced by these experiments. The methods used to fabricate photomasks, copper-beryllium evaporation masks, thick-and thin-film conductors, and resistors are described."
"Effective teaching for effective learning is of basic concern to everyone involved in the process of teaching. Yet, a reminder is often necessary to focus attention upon objectives and techniques to achieve such effectiveness. Points of views are presented to stimulate concern with the teaching function. These views are attempts to summarize a vast body of literature generated by individual efforts and group efforts. In this regard, special mention should be made of the initiatives being exerted by the American Society for Engineering Education through its regional Workshops on Effective Teaching to promote awareness, an initiative which began in 1960 as a Summer Institute."
"Active education might be defined as a system of instruction in which the student himself plays an active role in his education. The author expresses a certain number of suggestions, mostly based on his experiences, in order to help the achievement of active education in engineering. Theoretical lectures should raise active discussions, comparisons, and applications of theories; approaches different from those traditionally pursued are thus required for carrying out class work and for evaluating students. Applied research in universities should be primarily aimed at attaining educational goals; improving quality of instruction, obtaining the active participation of students in their education, stimulating a professional interest, making them aware of society and its problems. The last-mentioned objective might be easily achieved in communities of few natural resources in a developing country. Suggestions are made for obtaining a profitable use of the time to be dedicated to graduation thesis and for organizing in effective ways, works of students in laboratories. Finally, it is emphasized that experiences of students in industries, carefully organized, can help to make an active education as earlier defined. Furthermore, field experiences can serve to orient the students on their work aptitudes as well to enhance their knowledge of social environments."
"A generalized electromagnet suitable for use as an introductory educational tool is described which performs realistically the functions of a wide variety of electrical devices such as transformers and rotating machines. Performance tests indicate that simple and straightforward experiments can be performed with the apparatus which demonstrate many of the basic phenomena of electromagnetic equipment. The essential advantages of this introductory educational tool are its simplicity, ruggedness, versatility, and realistic performance."

 "This article analyzes the characteristics of the multiple-image technique of audiovisual communication and emphasizes its advantages over the more usual sequential presentation of supporting visual images. The features of the multiple-image technique are assessed and the production techniques peculiar to the method are examined. Audience reaction to this type of presentation is then considered. Evidence is presented to support the premise that this technique offers exciting potential for the presentation of technical papers, an area of communication which has received little attention for much too long a time."
"Words, long the sturdy base of communications, have entered a new dimension far beyond the realm of the printed page. New media and new communications techniques are replacing or supplementing many printed messages. TECHNICAL communications become technical COMMUNICATIONS, and a communicator who can master all media fills a new and expanding role in crossing all scientific boundaries. In this new age of communications, effectiveness of the media and the message through impact assessment become more important than scientific dogma, and ethics move the resulting benefits of presentation into the realm of working for the overall public good in the process."
"Criteria for situations in which writing is more effective as a communication tool compared to other media are discussed in this article. Emphasis is placed on \"when\" writing should be used instead of \"how\" to write. Survey-based guidelines are expressed in terms of administrative interrelation between people. Communication failure caused by implementation of the wrong medium is also discussed. An extended bibliography on oral communication, written communication, and the art of communication is included."
"A speaker may formally address an audience in the form of a speech, a presentation, or a lecture. The distinction between these forms is explained, and suitable applications for each are discussed. A great many of the requirements for effective communication by means of any of the three are common. A comprehensive breakdown of the factors involved and the choices available to the speaker is presented in diagrammatic form, supported by descriptive text."
"The quality of a technical presentation is related to the degree that the author understands the effective use of visual display media. These should supplement, not substitute for, portions of the oral presentation. The author must first recognize the the difference between the techniques of preparing a written report and a corresponding oral presentation. The oral-visual presentation using slides is, in itself, multimedia in character, but it is more effective if taken a few steps further. Good multimedia presentation implies that, by analysis and planning, the most effective medium is used for the type of information to be conveyed, so that maximum overall effectiveness is obtained. Our technical advances in systems, products, and services have been made possible by our own ability to analyze the end result sought; then to select, evaluate, and integrate a myriad of subsystems, components, and concepts from a multitude of disciplines. The multimedia presentation of technical information demands no more than the same considerations and applications."

 "This paper is a glossary defining several of the basic terms germane to information retrieval. Data-processing terms are also explained emphasizing their relationship to problems in information retrieval."
"The introduction of the remote real-time time-shared computer terminal, in the last decade, has ushered in the future era of computerized dissemination of information. The inter-active remote terminal brings the new dimension of dialoguing with the heretofore written word and opens the door to other information services and economies. The expected forthcoming era of \"paperless books,\" the computerized electronic fast transmission of books, magazines, etc., is the major topic of this paper. Its technology, application, benefits, and concerns are outlined for easing the information explosion problem engulfing all of us. Steps are discussed for evolving into common use during the next decade the computerized dissemination of information."
"Since many alerting and other information services rely very heavily on the use of titles to transfer information to the potential user, it is essential that he be aware of the proportion of the information contained in the complete document which will not be deducible from the title and which he will therefore miss. Methods will be discussed for analyzing the relative information content of the titles of engineering papers and results presented for the amount and type of information lost through scanning title listings only. Between one-third and one-half of indexable terms are not retrievable from article titles even if all possible synonyms and related terms are used. If all synonyms are used instead of one keyword, the amount of information retrieved is increased by about 70 percent. The problems of dealing with synonyms and with syntactical variants in searching titles indexes are discussed. The possibility of using keywords in journal titles as supplementary retrieval tags is suggested since they were deemed useful in nearly one-third of the sample of papers analyzed."
"part of the idea introduced is presented through the TYPOGRAPHy of this abstract. as OPTICal READers, SPEECH COMPRESsion, external VIDEO-FILE or MICROForm STORage, ANALOG-DIGITal-analog conversion, and free-TEXT SEARCHing are gradually combined with parallel processing COMPUTers, there is a growing need for SOURCE INDEXing and TEXT COMPRESsion of ABSTRACTs or the original full DOCUMENT RECORDs. a methodology is described which will meet these trends as well as shorten human READing time and facilitate BROWSing, SCANning, and INFORMation RETRIEVal within DOCUMENTs themselves. a simple PEDAL SWITCH device is used to bestow efficient functioning of CAPITAL and SMALL LETTERs. the outlined technique can be used in practical applications to speed up INFORMation RETRIEVal by most general-purpose DIGITal COMPUTers, but also implies design concepts for a special-purpose STRING PROCESsor, and units for ALPHABETic INPUT SORTing, WORD-STEM STORage, ASSOCIATive CONCEPT LINKage, and FILE ORGANIZation. in this context ALLOCATion of internal MEMORy and external STORage is discussed. the technical procedure and the rule of thumb for FORMATing may be regarded as a game of SEMANTic OPTIMization within the frame of certain criteria similar to ORIENTal WORD CHAINing such as HAIKU and RENGA. high INFORMation density and ENTROPy reduction is also anticipated while the basic principle is merely practical. GRAMMArless TEXT handling as described is reminiscent of ORWELL's NEWSPEAK in the year 1984."
"Encyclopedic storage is a method of storing knowledge that avoids unnecessary duplication and provides convenient access to the stored materials. This paper discusses a particular approach to encyclopedic storage of scientific and technical information which can now be implemented. Motivation for this approach is developed here by considering first some of the basic properties of the process of knowledge transfer via the written record, leading to the development of a unit of knowledge. In terms of this unit, the \"size\" of scientific and technical knowledge, and of electrical engineering knowledge, is estimated. This unit also becomes the basic building block for the proposed encyclopedic system. A very small experimental version of such a system is now in existence."
"Comparison was made between the natural language words and phrases contained in titles and full abstract text and the indexer-assigned, thesaurus-controlled, descriptors used to define information contained in articles abstracted for inclusion in Petroleum Abstracts. Exact as well as word synonym and phrase concept synonym \"matches\" were recorded. The study indicates that for the system as a whole only 40 percent of the total assigned descriptors was contained in the title and text of the abstract. This amount of the optimum information needed for retrieval is considered to be an unacceptable level of recovery."
"The current technology of the exploration and production segment of the petroleum industry is comprehensively reviewed by the Information Services Department of The University of Tulsa, and abstracts of pertinent articles and patents, domestic and foreign, are published in the weekly Petroleum Abstracts bulletin (approximately 15 000 abstracts per year). Format of the bulletin is such as to allow reprinting the abstracts on card stock for filing. Supplementing the current awareness aspects of the bulletin, an elaborate indexing system. based on controlled-vocabulary concept indexing, facilitates information retrieval from back files. Descriptors used to describe abstracted documents are listed together with extensive cross-indexing and hierarchical designations (broader or narrower terms) in an Exploration and Production Thesaurus. Monthly Alphabetic Subject Indexes are computer generated as searching tools, in which each abstract is cross indexed under multiple suitable subject headings. Supplemental alphabetic author indexes and numerical patent indexes are included. Cumulative indexes for the year are issued in June and December, the latter a hard-bound reference volume. At four-month intervals Dual Dictionary Coordinate Indexes (cumulative during the year) are published for retrieval by coordinate searching techniques. These same retrieval data are distributed on magnetic tape for automated computer searching."
"The information generators and receptors within a society and their connecting links constitute a complex network whose growth pattern must be understood in order to project future data communications needs. To attack this problem a model of society was constructed and categorized according to types of economic activity. Within each division of economic activity were individual units having similar inputs, outputs, and internal operating patterns. The nodal points of this framework were businesses, households, educational institutions, and governments tied together by linking information flows. The volume of all types of communications media, together with the growth patterns in the divisions of economic activity, can provide indications of future data communications parameters."
"As part of a field experiment conducted in three military laboratories, 85 scientists and engineers, comprising a sample group, were asked to provide data concerning their use of journals and technical reports. In addition to reporting what they did with respect to nearly one thousand documents over a four-week period, they provided individual data on their facilities for reading, handling, and storing documents; their reading habits; sources they use; the perceived efficiency and accuracy with which they handle documents; and the characteristics (i.e., title, abstract, etc.) of a document which help them in deciding whether or not to read it. These data confirm, in part, the results of prior user studies, but provide, in addition, a more direct evaluation of the interaction of the individual scientist and engineer with the \"natural queue\" of documents which come across his desk."
"This paper condenses the results of a detailed survey of 100 SDI systems throughout the world, conducted this year by the American Society for Information Science. The text develops the concept of SDI as a computerized method to provide for the effective flow of technical information among scientific workers. The current status of SDI in university, industrial, and government environments is analyzed and placed in historical perspective, with possible future trends developed particularly those that might affect the form of tomorrow's technical information media."
"For the past eleven years, a most unusual communications program has been taught at IBM's Electronics Systems Center. This program employs updated communications techniques that were utilized by the author when he organized the first (in industry) creative dramatics, children's theater, and adult drama groups at IBM. The development of the senses-listening, observing, and remembering-defines the course. This includes: 1) developing the senses to a keen degree, 2) observing with all the senses, 3) being consciously aware of using the senses. Listening retention and comprehension has increased from a documented 50 percentile level before training to a 90 percentile after training, an improvement of 80 percent. A two month retention survey shows a 25 percentile before training and a 60.5 percentile after training, an improvement of approximately 140 percent. The results of this pioneering effort in listening comprehension and retention far exceeded expectations."

"Contrary to a widespread notion that only leukemia plus certain rare cancers are radiation-induced in man, the evidence now points strongly to the induction of all forms of human cancer plus leukemia by ionizing radiation. These data amply justify the following three general laws of radiation-induction of cancer in man."
 "The types of Ge(Li) detector spectrum degradation due to \"trapping effects\" are first considered, and a model is presented which explains this degradation in terms of specific phenomena. Then two detector evaluation techniques which utilize infrared light for studying these phenomena are outlined and the significant results obtained using these techniques are presented. The infrared absorption measurement yields information concerning apparent strain in the crystal which can be related to localized trapping effects in the detector. The detector response to monochromatic infrared light determines the presence of localized lithium precipitation (a major cause of spectrum tailing) and permits a quantitative measurement of the important carrier traps in germanium such as the lithium-defect trap, copper, nickel, and iron. Utilizing these measurements, it is possible to completely characterize the performance of a crystal and determine the source of detector degradation in one day. Very good correlation is consistently obtained."
"A study of the main characteristics of boron ion implanted N-type silicon detectors is presented : a FWHM of 3.1 keV has been obtained at 77°K for 1 MeV conversion electrons. Special emphasis is given to the window thickness of these counters, which is deduced from the pulse height defect observed for low energy protons as compared to γ-rays of the same energy. The variation of the window thickness with the applied bias voltage is studied for different values of the following parameters : starting material resistivity, crystal axis orientation, dose, annealing temperature. These measurements allowed the determination of the implanted impurity distribution profile down to eight or nine orders of magnitude below the maximum of this profile ."
"Some of the more desirable features of large volume coaxial and smaller volume planar detectors are combined in a planar pair configuration of planar lithium drifted germanium diodes. The present work examines some of the more important considerations involved and presents data obtained using a 27 cm3 planar pair with energy resolution of 3.0 keV FWHM at 1.33 MeV."
"Variations in the value of the effective Fano factor, F', have been observed in Ge(Li) detectors using a collimated beam of γ-rays to irradiate selected areas in the sensitive region between the n+-and p-contacts. For regions near the n+-contact where the trapping of electrons is minimized, F' was found to be statistically less than 0.11."
"The response uniformity across the entrance window of a 1 cm diam funnel electron channel multiplier has been increased by installing a high transparency grid in front of the multiplier and operating at the same potential. The funnel surface was scanned by a 1/8 diam 1-20 keV hydrogen atom beam. With either a negative potential applied to the front edge or positive potential to the collector, the response as indicated by the counting rate, was flat over the central 8-9 mm multiplier aperture. Measurements of the multiplier gain indicated maximum gain near the outer edge and minimum gain in the channel region."
"Inproved utilization of incident x-ray quanta in medical x-ray image intensifier tubes will allow operation at reduced x-ray dose levels and/or yield pictures with higher signal-to-noise ratio. This paper describes the characteristics and performances of experimental screens and image intensifier tubes using La2O2S(Tb) and Gd2O2S(Tb) phosphors. Inproved quantum utilization by a factor of 2 to 3 is observed relative to screens and image intensifier tubes made with conventional ZnCdS(Ag) phosphors. Accordingly, reduction of patient and operator dosage by a factor of 2 to 3 is found to be possible."
"Two rare earth materials, La2O2S:Tb and Gd2O2S:Tb, have significant potential as inputscreen phosphors for x-ray image intensifier use. These materials exhibit high luminescent efficiencies and high x-ray absorption. In this paper we present a detailed discussion of the properties of these new phosphors and suggestions for further improving their performance in image intensifier tubes."
"An improved method for fabricating a thin-window planar detector was developed at Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, Livermore. This detector is designed to analyze spectra of low-energy as well as high-energy gamma and x rays. The detector has a planar configuration with a relatively large gold surface barrier entry window. The main advantage of this detector is its faster drifting time coupled with minimum waste of material. This method of fabrication has significant advantages over earlier techniques."
 "The radial profile of ionized impurities concentration was determined in different high purity silicon wafers, used for manufacturing solid state detectors. The measurement was carried on by determining as a function of radial position the depletion voltages of surface barrier dE/dx detectors made on the samples under study and whose circular useful surfaces were concentric with the wafers. The ratio bet ween the diameter of the detectors useful surfaces and the diameter of the wafers was between 0.75 and 0.85. The point-by-point depletion voltages were measured by means of ionizing particles sent on the back side of the detectors. All the samples considered showed a maximum of ionized impurities concentration at the center of the slice and the variation between the center and the edges was of the order of 60% with respect to the maximum value. These radial non-uniformities can remarkably change the performance of detectors with respect to the uniform concentration case. Particularly in nuclear spectro metry, if possible radial variations in the depletion region depth are not taken into account, worse resolving powers and pulse height defects can result."
"The gains of seven units of a commonly used channel electron multiplier model have been observed as a function of total accumulated counts in a clean, ion-pumped vacuum station at 3 × 10-10 Torr. After decreasing by a factor of two to three during the first 5 × 107 counts of operation, all gains remained relatively constant until the channel multipliers had each accumulated about 1010 counts at which time a continual degradation began. A typical channel electron multiplier degraded from a gain of 1.25 × 108 at 1010 counts to 7.0 × 107 at 1.4 × 1011 total accumulated counts, The effects of gain fatigue on high count-rate capability, on resistance, and on the output pulse-height spectrum shape are also presented, Less extensive data showing the long-term stability characteristics of a newer model of channel multiplier with longer life are included."
"Approximate methods are presented for calculation of intrinsic total-absorption-and double-escape-peak efficiencies of Ge(Li) detectors. These methods utilize \"average\" characteristics of gamma-ray photon interactions with matter, and, while developed in this paper for specific application to the Ge(Li) detector efficiency problem, should be applicable to any gamma-ray detector or absorptive medium. The technique for total-absorption-peak efficiency determination includes the use of an \"average-photon energy-degradation curve\" and of the Dirac chord method for calculation of collision probabilities. The average-photon energy-degradation curve is obtained from differential Compton collision cross sections and detector material total-crosssection characteristics; it is independent of detector size and shape. The Dirac chord method is then used to determine the probability of further collisions for photons \"generated\" within the detector volume. In the model these probabilities are functions only of a characteristic detector dimension, sμ, where s is the average chord length and μ is the total linear attenuation coefficient. Double-escape-peak efficiencies are determined through the calculation of the average probability of occurrence of the following three phenomena: (1) pair production, (2) electron-positron absorption, and (3) annihilation-photon double escape. Complete working curves and expressions are included to enable convenient utilization of these techniques. Example results are compared with efficiency determinations made experimentally and by Monte Carlo calculations."
"A hybrid particle spectrometer possessing high-sensitivity and high-time resolution for the measurement of precipitating protons, electrons, and alpha particles during Polar-Cap-Absorption (PCA) events has been successfully operating in space aboard the OV1-18 satellite since 23 March 1969. Detection of protons in the energy range 1.2 to 46 MeV and integral above 70 MeV, electrons in the range 0.4 to 1.9 MeV and alpha particles in the range 7 to 20 MeV is performed with sensitivities as high as 0.1 particle/cm2-sec and with a dynamic intensity range of six decades through the use of a transmission solid-state detector in conjunction with a total-energy, plastic-scintillation detector. Acceptable pulses from each detector, as determined by various combinations of coincidence logic, are analyzed with separate 15-channel pulse-height analyzers of the analog-to-digital type. A detailed description of the spectrometer, including a unique biasing technique which maintains a constant potential across the solid-state detector, independent of leakage variations due to temperature and radiation damage, will be given. Some typical characteristics of the particles measured during several PCA events will also be presented."
"Proportional counters have been developed for use in satellite X-ray astronomy experiments. The counters are all beryllium with 2.5 mil (63.5 micron) windows, using epoxy seals. They are shown to have excellent long-term stability and resistance to environmental stress, except for 100% humidity."
"This paper describes the design techniques used in producing two magnetic-core memories for space-flight applications. The design stresses low power, dense packaging and wide operating temperature range. Data showing secure operation for temperatures between -50° C and +80°C are presented. Typical power consumption exclusive of programming logic for a 1024 × 8-bit core array is 57 mW plus 9.8 μJ per readwrite cycle and for a 4096 × 10-bit array is 72 mW plus 12.8 μJ per cycle. The 4096 × 10-bit array has been assembled as a dual-cycle 2048 × 20-bit memory and packaged using soldered cordwood modules. The time required for a single read-add-one-write cycle is 4 μs."
"This paper briefly reviews some in-flight calibration systems used on satellite particle detector experiments and gives a detailed description of the technique used to calibrate the IMP-I Solar Proton Monitoring Experiment (SPME). A short discussion of each calibration technique is presented in an attempt to inform the reader of the potential uses of in-flight calibration systems. The SPME in-flight calibrator illustrates the trade-offs made in the design of a calibrator for an experiment which uses silicon solid state detectors. A meaningful measure of detector performance is obtained by use of a noise monitor which measures the effective average noise of the detectors with ± 2% accuracy over a 10:1 dynamic range and a 5 MHz bandwidth. In addition, the SPME incorporates a pulser which makes a ± 2% check of amplifier gains and discriminator level settings by applying a piecewise linear envelope of charge pulses to the charge sensitive preamplifiers."
"A high counting rate particle detector is described to measure trapped protons from 18.5 MeV to 400 MeV and electrons from approximately 1.2 MeV to 10 MeV. The instrument is a directional dE/dx - E telescope composed of solid state and scintillation counters with an acceptance angle of 450 and an energy independent geometric factor of approximately .4 cm2 sterad. The dE/dx detectors are fully depleted silicon surface barrier detectors of 500 micron thickness and 3 cm2 area. The energy detector is a sodium activated cesium iodide crystal of 100 MeV thickness for protons. A plastic scintillator is used as an anticoincidence shield. The detector design, electronics system, and calibration data for protons are presented in this paper."
"The operation of a closed-loop, in-flight calibration system is described. This system utilizes a Cesium Iodide crystal with a grown-in Am241 source as the calibration reference and a programmable photomultiplier dynode supply as the gain-change element. Through the use of this system, the overall gain of a particle spectrometer is expected to be kept accurate to within 3% throughout the changing orbital environment. Approximate power consumption of the system, including the dynode supply, analog section and digital sectoring and control is 415 milliwatts."
"A system of generating and controlling high voltage D. C. potentials for use with photomultiplier tubes is described. Emphasis is placed on simplicity of electrical and mechanical design through the use of modern miniature components and thick film technology. The photomultiplier power converter was designed to supply the potentials required by the P. M. tube in a particle spectrometer for high counting rates.(1) The high voltage is programmable over a limited range (100V) for automatic experiment calibration adjustment.(2) The prime parameters to be considered in the design were: voltage stability, high load current capability, low ripple, programmable, multi outputs for the dynodes, low power consumption, small size and weight, and direct package interface with a round P. M. tube housing."
"The application and methods of in vivo neutron activation analysis to measure the chemical composition of the major elements in the human body are still in the early stages of development. However, the technique is being used routinely to measure total body calcium which cannot be accurately measured by any other method at the present time. The instrumentation required for determining the total body content of major elements in humans after exposure to a low level neutron flux includes an automated system to provide a safe, precise, and uniform neutron irradiation throughout the entire body and a sensitive whole body counting system for measuring the gamma rays from the radionuclides produced in the body."
"Liquid scintillators, proportional counters, nuclear emulsions, etched track detectors, and thermoluminescent crystals have been used to measure the enviromental neutron flux from thermal to 10 MeV energies, below ground, at ground level, at an air-water interface, on a tower, and at an airborne altitude of 20,000 feet. Results are compared with calculations based on a modified program for reactor computations."
"Potential benefits to man from the use of nuclear explosives for excavation are considerable. Proposed applications actively being studied under the Atomic Energy Commission's Plowshare Program include construction of canals, harbors, and dams. Potential economic advantages of nuclear explosives over conventional chemical explosives and excavation machinery are so great as to permit consideration of projects otherwise entirely unfeasible. However, the use of nuclear explosives in excavation projects implies the potential release of radioactivity into the biosphere. The biological implications of such releases must be evaluated before any nuclear excavation project can be seriously considered. The Bio-Medical Division of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory of Livermore is pursuing investigations intended to systematically analyze the effects on the biosphere of the release of radionuclides from experimental Plowshare cratering events. Data from these studies will be used to evaluate and refine existing predictive methods."
"The AEC and the nuclear industry have historically been committed to environmental control of nuclear effluents. A valuable tool in this control is a sophisticated aerial radiation detection and tracking system operated for the AEC by EG&G, Las Vegas, Nevada. The components and applications of this system are described, and typical missions are illustrated."
"The application of nuclear engineering discussed in this paper relates to digital processing of images formed by the detection of gamma radiation retained in various organs in the body after the injection of radio-pharmaceuticals. These images are presented in a color photograph display to aid diagnosis and minimize system artifacts."
"Stable and radioactive daughter products produced from nuclear disintegrations of uranium have proved useful in fundamental studies of the geochemistry of uranium in igneous rock and sedimentary environments and in ore deposits. Information gained from geochemical studies of uranium migration has been used to develop models for attempts to date archeological, geological, and oceanographic environments represented by samples of bone, wood, charcoal, continental and marine carbonates, marine sediments, and glacially derived soils. Recent improvements of nuclear instrumentation and techniques allowed accurate measurements of natural radioactive isotopes, and it is now believed that radioactive equilibrium between the long-lived isotopes of the two uranium decay series is more the exception than the rule in nature. It was assumed that the 234U and 238U isotopes were in equilibrium until Thurber confirmed that considerable separation between 234U daughter and 238U parent exists in nature. It now has been documented that the 234U content may range from 60% deficient to 500% in excess relative to 238U. An excess of 15% of 234U isotope in sea water is well documented. A summary of previous work has shown that geochemical fractionation of the radioactive nuclides in 238U and 235U decay series takes place in the hydrologic environment, resulting in depletion of 230Th and 231Pa with respect to their parents, 238U, 234U, and 235U, in water and a complementary enrichment of these daughter nuclides in some sediments. Subsequent assimilation of Uranium, essentially free of radioactive daughters, occurs in some specific types of deposits such as carbonates and phosphates."
"A system was developed to transfer digital nuclear data and position control data from a high altitude balloon to earth for experiment control and monitoring purposes. The system was designed to be operated and maintained by personnel without access to, or familiarity with more complex military-aerospace telemetry data systems. Low cost, accessibility to the equipment and versatility are emphasized. Simple interfaces connect varied data sources and monitoring instruments to standard transfer units on the balloon and on the ground. A multiplexer-interface was designed to transfer data, recorded during a balloon flight, from a magnetic tape to a small computer which produces an IBM-compatible tape suitable for analysis by a large computer."
"A review of factors affecting air-sea gas exchange suggests that the exchange rate may be more dependent upon the rate of sea surface renewal than upon the boundary film thickness. In either case wind velocity dominates the exchange rate. Both the gas exchange rate and the rate of vertical mixing can be evaluated by measurements of the radon profile in the upper 100 m of the water. Radon is extracted from eight depths in the profile using a set of continuous flow extractors which efficiently remove radon and other dissolved gases at flow rates of 1-2 1/min. Radon measurements in the Atlantic suggest gas exchange rates corresponding to a transfer velocity of 0.005 to 0.010 cm/sec (film thickness 10-20 μ) at wind speeds of 10-20 knots."
"The techniques used to radioassay for fallout nuclides, in particular 137Cs, by gamma ray spectrometry are described. Details are given of the computer analysis of the spectra, of the internal energy standardization by the 0.511 MeV annihilation and 40K photopeaks, and of the use of smoothed background spectra. Agreement is shown between the computer method and a previously-used freehand graphical method."
"Large samples of fallout cesium can be collected for surveying oceanic distributions by absorbing upon certain types of ferrocyanide granules contacted with sea water. Sample size is conveniently normalized by reference to the natural nuclide also collected. Surveying and analytical techniques have been developed and much of the Pacific has been surveyed."
"A set of consecutively executed computer programmes have been developed for the quantitative interpretation of gamma ray spectra obtained with Ge(Li) detectors. The method compares spectral information with catalogued nuclear data and yields least squares fitted sets of activity which subsequently may be converted to parent masses. Results are presented for samples of unknown trace element composition and for spectra synthesized from the spectra of neutron irradiated high purity samples of elements and their oxides."
"A brief description of the optoelectronic feedback system is followed by an account of some interesting aspects of low-noise preamplifiers and detectors revealed by this work. These include the following items: 1. The observation of hole collection at the gate of a FET analogous to ion collection at the grid of a vacuum tube. 2. Mechanical failure modes of light-emitting diodes when cycling their temperature to and from 77°K. 3. A counting-rate effect due to the mean current in the feedback path. This naturally leads to a philosophical discussion of the equivalence of resistor and light-coupled feedback systems. It also suggests the potential advantages of using a pulsed, rather than dc, feedback system. We also report the use of the optoelectronic feedback system for the observation of a Fano factor of .08 or less for a germanium detector."
"The emphasis of this paper, in which a systematic approach to nuclear pulse shaping is presented, is on the power, versatility, and practicability of lumped-element transfer functions and their associated networks. The approach consists of first determining a suitable theoretical, but realizable, lumped-element transfer function for the problem at hand -- pulse height analysis is the example used in this paper -- and of then synthesizing this transfer function in a way that minimizes the sensitivity of the final output-pulse shape to network element variations. Finally, the network is built and tested using elements having tolerances determined by a sensitivity analysis of the chosen circuits. The unipolar transfer functions and networks discussed in this paper have better signal-to-noise ratios than any other published lumped-element transfer functions or networks. One unipolar pulse function has a signal-to-noise ratio that is only 0.5% worse than that of the delayline-produced triangular pulse. Since the bipolar pulses discussed in this paper are more symmetrical about the base line than those of any other published lumped-element network, spectral peaks at high count rates obtained with these networks will be more symmetrical than those obtained with any other lumped-element network. Furthermore, these symmetrical pulses will produce smaller countrate-dependent base-line shifts than will less-symmetrical equal-area pulses. Although the networks that are discussed in this paper are extremely useful for pulse height analysis, the systematic approach that is presented is more important because of its obvious extensions to other pulse shaping problems in nuclear physics."
"A comprehensive control theory of digitally stabilized nuclear spectrometers has provided a quantitative basis for the optimal selection of various system parameters. The theoretical predictions are compared with measured resolution functions for a stabilized Ge(Li) photon spectrometer. Implications for stabilizer design will be discussed."
"A new charge sensitive preamplifier permits state of the art timing with semiconductor detectors without compromising energy resolution. The compromises that are involved in previous methods of obtaining amplitude and time information are avoided by using a single input FET followed by fast, low noise circuitry. With the same input transistor the noise in the \"energy\" channel is the same to within a few per cent as for the best room temperature preamplifiers. There are two timing outputs. The faster of these is voltage sensitive and has a rise time of 2 nsec. The slower output, which is obtained from the output of the charge sensitive loop, has a rise time of less than 5 nsec for external input capacities up to 50 pF with 0.5 pF feedback capacitor. The leading edge response can be adjusted to approach an exponential function with a time constant as low as 6 nsec. This property is desirable when timing with thick detectors that have a fluctuating charge collection time, where it is necessary to trigger near the base line."
"At present in non-dispersive X-ray spectrometers the electronic noise of the pulse amplifier input circuit prevents full realization of the inherent resolution of the semiconductor detector. Commercially available low noise JFET's encapsulated with boro-silicate (7052)glass insulated headers have typical noise contributions to detector resolution widths (FWHM), at 25°C, of 326 eV (Si). JFET's encapsulated with BeO or Al2O3 headers contribute ~200 eV to the resolution at 25°C and 150 eV at about -20°C. Techniques to select passive components which do not inhibit the performance of these transistors are discussed."
"In this paper the operation of low noise charge preamplifiers under high instantaneous pulse rates - \"bursts\" - is considered. An overload recovery circuit employing a field-effect transistor as the switch for the recovery current is described. The overload charge generated in the detector by the radiation burst in a time short compared to the small signal resolving time of the spectrometer may be 105 or more times larger than the charge due to a single particle to be measured between the bursts. The recovery time of the charge amplifier with the recovery circuit is less than 10 μsec. With a conventional amplifier-filter, the recovery time of the system to within the noise level is 50 to 100 μsec. The increase in noise due to the recovery circuit corresponds to an increase in the input capacitance of the charge amplifier of 2 pF."
"The full potential of high-resolution gamma-ray spectronetry with Ge(Li) detectors has been severely limited by degradation in the quality of the pulse-height spectrum at high input data rates. A direct-coupled system featuring peak pile-up rejection, tail pile-up rejection (baseline inspection), RC shaping and, uniquely, no baseline restoration or primary pulse train delay has been built. This paper will present system results in terms of gamma-ray spectra as well as system philosophy and circuit design."
"A counting system stabilizer, which provides two gain-stabilized data channels without requiring an external gain-controllable element, is described. Measurements show that in a typical NaI photomultiplier system subjected to normal environmental perturbations, net gain fluctuations were reduced to about 0.05%."
"This paper considers the recovery of broadband non-random signals distorted by the dynamics of the transmission system and corrupted by additive noise. The design and performance of deconvolution and compensation systems for a mean-square performance measure are discussed. After pointing out the deficiencies of deconvolution without compensation, the joint design of the two signal processing schemes under engineering constraints is presented and illustrated by some examples. Finally the results obtained when the signals are samples of stationary random processes with known statistics are briefly discussed."
"The technique of constant fraction of pulse height is shown to be useful for timing with NaI(Tl) scintillators. A comparison of the results of constant fraction timing with leading edge timing indicates that the two techniques are equivalent for small dynamic ranges. For large dynamic ranges constant fraction timing is shown to be a significant improvement over leading edge timing. Also, constant fraction timing over narrow dynamic ranges represents an improvement of 13.7 over the slow crossover timing with NaI(Tl) as reported by Bell. Multiple time sampling is used to investigate how much time information is contained in a NaI(Tl) scintillator pulse. Since an additional time sample represents an improvement of only 11 percent over a single constant fraction measurement, it is concluded that a system more sophisticated than constant fraction will not significantly improve the time resolution."
"The design evolution of a wideband voltage-sensitive amplifier stage is presented. For the basic stage, including a new driver configuration and overload control circuit, three basic input sections are considered; the first section consists of differentially connected bipolar transistors for use with low generator impedances, the second consists of medium-transconductance FETs to allow larger coupling time constants, and the third consists of high-transconductance FETs for low-noise performance with large coupling time constants. Large-and small-signal bandwidth analysis is given for each configuration. From this analysis, criteria are established for allowing equal large-and small-signal rise times. Also, for each type of input section, expressions of equivalent noise voltage are derived. A table of experimental results is presented, summarizing data obtained for several important performance parameters. Typical measurements for the medium-transconductance FET input section for a voltage gain of 16 include small-and large-signal rise times of 10 nsec, overload recovery times from a 5-v input of ~20 nsec, and integral nonlinearity of <0.05%."
"A nine-decade (10-13 to 10-4 amp) and a five-decade (4 × 10-12 to 4 × 10-7 amp) dc logarithmic electrometer have been designed, and their performance evaluated. The problems of drift, linear-to-log conversion accuracy, temperature dependence, and frequency response are considered. An accuracy of better than ±0.6%/decade (~2% of reading) was achieved."
"A current-to-frequency converter was developed for low level current measurements of wide dynamic range. It measures currents from 5 × 10-13 to 6 × 10-5 amperes without range switching and by the use of state-of-the-art circuit components. It has a corresponding linear seven-decade transfer characteristic of 10-11 amperes per Hertz with a maximum output frequency of greater than 5 × 106 Hz. The converter was designed to monitor photomultiplier tube current in an automated thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) system."
"An inexpensive, compact, low-power glass delay line memory PHA, functionally designed for educational, as distinct from research applications, is described. Using series 74 I/C logic and consuming 20W with CRT display, it performs the basic sorting function, can be strobed, and contains a three-stage digital buffer derandomizer giving it virtually zero resolving time up to 8 kp/s input. The novel logic schemes are described."
"The application of a high resolution semiconductor energy dispersive x-ray analyzer in scanning electron microscopy is described. Optimum specifications of an x-ray spectrometer for such application are outlined and various problems related to detection of low energy x-rays are discussed. Characteristic x-rays of elements down to oxygen were detected with the described system, making it useful for a variety of industrial and research applications."
"An outline is given of the techniques used in the manufacture of lithium drifted silicon and germanium detectors. With current techniques detectors having areas of 25-50 mm2 and a few millimeters thick can be prepared to give a resolution of better than 300eV. The main applications of these detectors in electron microprobe analysis and X-ray fluorescence analysis are reviewed. In these fields the ability of the detectors to measure simultaneously the fluorescent X-rays from a wide range of elements considerably improves the techniques and extends their use. Applications of instruments incorporating semiconductor X-ray spectrometers in the laboratory, in the field and on-line are reviewed."
"Neutron flux detectors of the counting type, as designed for thermal reactors may provide a capability for some fast reactor control safety and surveillance applications. Shortterm tests in environments of up to 106 R/hr gamma and to 950°F served to characterize the operational limits for the sensors. Fast pulse-shaping techniques (20 to 50 nanoseconds) improved the gamma tolerance capability of sensors having collection times of 50 to 200 nanoseconds."
 "The Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator (ORELA) facility includes a linear accelerator and a series of computers for real-time data acquisition and on-line analysis of the acquired data. The unique features of the data acquisition computers are the following: a word-addressed, fixed-head disk; a direct-memory access, four-channel priority multiplexer capable of a peak data rate of 25,000 events/sec per channel; and a program-controlled, subaddressed device interface. Operation of the word-addressed, fixed-head disk through software and hardware control allows the experimental events to determine which channels are to have their contents read into the core memory from the disk for updating, with a resulting theoretical maximnum average data rate of 11,000 events/sec. Trade-offs for future systems are possible between the hardware and software. Operation of the priority multiplexer is described briefly. A modified, TMC, 4096-channel time-of-flight analyzer allows control from the computer through the multiplexer. A pulse generating unit, mounted in a triple-width NIM module, operates through one channel of the program-controlled device interface to control a TMC time-of-flight analyzer and a sample changer. The sample changer operates in a feedback loop that is controlled by a computer program."
"Several pulse-height analyzers time-share a large disk memory for on-line accumulation of sorted spectra. The system is controlled by a PDP-8 computer which performs a two-level hardware-software sort on the data in real time. The computer dynamically allocates storage to incoming events and schedules disk accesses to achieve high sorting rates under a variety of counting loads."
"BONER-II, a revision of BONER, a programmed on-line multi-laboratory data acquisition system implemented on Bonner Nuclear Laboratories' IBM 1800 Computer, supported by IBM's Time-Sharing Executive (TSX), and interfaced with Bonner Laboratories' Experiment Control Unit (ECU), incorporates the following features: i) independent concurrent acquisition and analysis of data from a maximum of eight laboratories; ii) dynamic real-time storage allocation of data input/output buffer blocks, processed or unprocessed data analysis buffer blocks, and program blocks; iii) garbage collection and relocation of core blocks to optimize usage of core; iv) dynamic allocation and release of peripheral equipment to accommodate the varying needs of the various laboratories; v) selective program-controlled display of data analysis buffers; vi) queueing of non-process function programs to operate on displayed data analysis buffers; vii) partial or total real-time data analyses (the percentage of which can be varied by the experimenter); viii) non-process time-sharing of program compilation and debugging, or data analyses as coordinated by TSX when BONER-II is not in control. This paper will discuss the software implementation of BONER-II to a multi-laboratory environment for the purpose of maximizing usage of computer resources while minimizing the experimenter's need to interact with the computer data acquisition system."
"A 16,000 channel time-of-flight analyzer is described. The time channels are divided into groups of 512 channels. Channel widths of 20 nsec or binary multiples thereof, up to 1280 nsec, may be independently selected for each group. The time information is stored in a 16 word derandomizing buffer capable of accepting new data every 20 nsec. The buffer empties into a computer, with 32K of core memory, which can accept a word of data every 800 nsec. For this emptying rate, losses due to buffer size will be less than 0.1% for random arrival rates up to 106 words/sec."
"A fast parallel logic system employing MECL II integrated circuits with a total analysis time of about 100 nsec was used to preselect elastic scattering events in a K-p scattering experiment. A ninety counter scintillation hodoscope arranged in banks of ten counters each allowed the selection of events on the basis of a) The presence of exactly two outgoing particles b) Coplanarity of outgoing particles with respect to the incoming beam c) Approximate agreement of outgoing angles with calculated kinematic requirements. About 3% of candidate events satisfied this set of restrictions and initiated spark chamber pulsing and data transfer to a computer."
 "A programmed communications controller (PCC) has been designed using a small digital computer. The PCC is connected to a multi-user on-line system which controls nine experiments at the Brookhaven High Flux Beam Reactor. The purpose of the PCC is to process and switch all messages between sixteen teletypewriter terminals and the time-sharing system. The PCC serves \"local\" terminals at each experiment and \"remote\" terminals at distances up to one mile from the reactor. The PCC also controls message transfers between local and remote terminals. Arguments are given why a digital computer has been chosen rather than a hardwired device."
"This paper describes the interface used for online control of the Princeton-Pennsylvania Accelerator with a PDP-9. The paper is organized into four sections. The first section is concerned with the specifications for the equipment. The requirements are unique because of the cyclic nature of the synchrotron. Section two discusses various I/O techniques and the design compromises they require. The third section deals with the concept of an analog data break interface. The last section is a summary of existing and planned hardware."
"The usual least squares fitting technique for gamma spectrum analysis has been expanded to include the computation of gain and baseline shifts. An iterative nonlinear technique is used. Since the shifting parameters are determined from the sample spectrum, no additional calibration data are needed. Implementation provided fitting up to 14 standards using an 8K PDP-8 with DECtape."
"The Bell-Rutgers data highway system is a modular, general purpose system designed to provide a framework in which the configuration and reconfiguration of on-line computer hardware is easily accomplished. It is built using modified NIM hardware, and features a 16 bit parallel data path for input and output which is shared by up to 150 general purpose modules. Special consideration has been given to two particular problems; the operation of modules in an environment in which digital switching noise must be minimized, and the simultaneous use of the module system by several independent users. The initial application of the system has been in the implementation of a computer based nuclear physics data acquisition and analysis system. The following paper is intended as an exposition of some of the considerations which are relevant to the design of any general purpose modular system as well as a description of a particular system. Some of the ways in which the system has been used are also described."
"A modular digital data system originally designed for magnetostrictive wire spark chambers has been expanded to include most digital high energy physics data. The system is built around a 12 bit data bus and has been implemented for a number of computers and other output devices. This paper summarizes three years of operating experience."
"Some of the questions that arise when considering a standard data-bussing system are discussed. The discussion is restricted to applications in high-energy physics instrumentation. It is pointed out that it is necessary to provide for the operation of such systems without on-line computers."
"Philosophically, small computer input/output connections can be made to a standard (such as CAMAC), rather than directly to a particular computer. Where manufacturer-produced software is either non-existent or can be sacrificed without heavy losses, a bigger computer may be practical with money saved from in-house interfacing. Such in-house peripheral interfacing can be made even more economical by practicing interface standardization. An example is discussed with solutions to the major problems involved."
"The CAIVIAC modular instrumentation scheme provides a standardised means of data transfer between plug-in units within the same crate (data-bin). An extension of the scheme permits multicrate systems to make use of a standard interconnection which incorporates flexible dem. and handling and automatic adjustment of the transfer timing. With the exception of the computer interface all components of a system are then computer independent and interchangeable."
"A modular bus oriented digital interface system has been designed and is being implemented for on-line data acquisition in low energy nuclear physics and related experiments. The structure of the system is similar in many ways to that of CAMAC, but differs specifically in that modular construction is simplified for rapid single unit fabrication and debug. The system will be used in conjunction with an EMR 6130 and an SDS 9300 digital computer."
"In the design of systems for data acquisition and control, the hardware and software tradeoff is governed by a number of interrelated factors. The availability and capability of hardware, the effective decrease in hardware costs with similar increases of software costs force quantitative decisions on the determination of the system parameters that effect the design efficiency. This paper discusses many of the system characteristics abstracted from several computer aided experiments which may be used as a guide in design."
"An automatic data collection system for four Mössbauer effect experiments has been implemented by Argonne National Laboratory utilizing a small general purpose digital computer and a special purpose interface. This system, being characteristic of open-loop, on-line systems, permits maximum utilization to be made of interface hardware to fully automate data collection from four simultaneous experiments, while the computer is in a \"halt\" condition or being utilized for background processing. Extensive consideration was given in the design of this system to achieve the most advantageous balance of hardware and software."
"This paper presents the results of in-core experiments conducted to demonstrate the performance of microwave neutron flux detectors. For a microwave resonant cavity, a frequency shift, as caused by a neutron-generated plasma within the cavity, results in a detection technique capable of covering up to six decades of reactor power."
"The theory of operation and initial experimental results given in this paper pertain to a microwave frequency pressure sensor applicable to measurements within liquid metal cooled, fast breeder reactors. The basis of operation of the pressure sensor depends on the deflection of one end wall of a cylindrical microwave cavity and on the measurement of the resultant change of cavity resonant frequency. Temperature dependence of the sensor output signal is significantly reduced by measuring the difference frequency between two identical resonant cavities. The dual cavity (1.9-cm long by 3.3-cm diameter) sensor yielded nearly linear response over the temperature range 75 to 1200°F and for pressures up to one atmosphere, with sensitivities of 0.5 and 0.8 MHz/psi at 75 and 1200°F, respectively. The 0.015-cm thick stainless steel diaphragm also responded without permanent deformation for applied pressure of 45 psi. Pressure sensor time response to abrupt changes of pressure equals about 7.5 ms. The sensor and associated transmission waveguide fabricated of metal only should be immersible in the liquid metal coolant."
"At the temperature and radiation levels expected in the core region of some projected reactor plants, conventional radiation sensors, such as fission chambers, suffer severe radiation damage. On the other hand, remote location of sensors introduces geometry effects. These circumstances emphasize the need for a power level sensor which is highly resistant to the hostile environment and still responds directly to power level changes. Such a detection channel has been proposed. It is based on sensing the gamma flux above some energy threshold, thus discriminating against gamma radiation associated with decay. In addition, the proposed system dispenses with cables and voltages applied across damageable insulators, through sensing the light transmitted along a cylindrical duct. The detecting medium is the gas with which the duct is filled; the light signal is the Cherenkov radiation generated by relativistic Compton recoil electrons. Cherenkov radiation intensity increases sharply from an electron velocity threshold, which depends on the index of refraction of the medium. For gases, this threshold can be continuously varied by adjusting the gas pressure. On the other hand, electrons with subthreshold velocities can generate (background) light through scintillation processes. In order to assay the overall discrimination available from the choice of gas, pressure, and geometry, a series of tests has been under way with 3-MeV electron pulses from a Van de Graaff accelerator."
"A mathematical analysis and some numerical results are presented that indicate how the ratio of the outputs from a true-mean-square and an average-magnitude-squared linear type detector in a Campbelling neutron monitoring system vary over a wide range of neutron fluxes or pulse rates for a given system output signal shape. Two types of system output pulse shapes have been considered. One type is of the form v = Vε-ωt corresponding to a single differentiated output pulse. The other shape has the form v = C1ε-ωt + C2ε-ω1t + C3ε-ω2t corresponding to a double differentiated and single integrated output pulse. C1, C2, and C3 are constants depending upon the system characteristics. For the single differentiated pulse shape, the analysis verifies that the output signal ratio begins to deviate from the constant value 0.637 when the input pulse rate decreases below the single low cut-off frequency, ω, of the system. As for the double differentiated, single integrated pulse shape, all three time constants influence the results. For the specific case where the integrating time constant, 1/ω2, is much smaller than either differentiating time constant, 1/ω or 1/ω1, and these last two time constants are made equal, the output signal ratio also deviates from the constant value of 0.637 when the input pulse rate decreases below the low cut-off frequencies. Some measurements of the two types of output signals, |v⊽|2 and v2, obtained from actual Campbelling systems, show excellent agreement with the numerical results for both types of pulse shape considered."
"The use of a digital computer to achieve closed loop optimal control of a nuclear reactor is presented. A performance index is defined, and dynamic programming is applied to derive an optimal stationary feedback control law. The control law requires that all state variables be available, therefore nonlinear estimation is used to generate the nonmeasurable system state variables."
"Equipment has been developped for detecting small amount of fissile materials remaining in hulls, after irradiated fuel dissolving operation. The equipment described in this paper is running in French fuel processing plant AT-1 located at La Hague (France). The method consists in : - First, leached-hulls irradiation by neutron generator. - Secondly, delayed-neutron counting techniques. It makes possible to monitor one basket full of leached-hull pieces in 30 minutes and to detect an amount of 20 milligrammes uranium 235 equivalent with 100 % accuracy."
"A totally depleted diffused junction silicon radiation detector is used to monitor N16 in the coolant of a heavy water nuclear power reactor. The detector operates at boiler room ambient temperature and is stable and reliable. The system provides discrimination against background from corrosion and activation products with very little shielding required. The detector characteristics which affect accuracy are described and special features are incorporated to improve system stability."
"An electronic signal processor is described which, in general, may be applied to approximate a distributed variable from discrete measurements. The processor also determines the optimum location for the discrete measurement transducers which results in the best approximation to the distributed variable. A particular application is presented which demonstrates how the processor may be applied to determine an in-core neutron flux distribution from in-core detectors located within the core of a Pressurized Water Reactor."
 "An analytical transfer function model is derived for a coupled-core reactor, with an independent control system for each core. Using this model, the stability of the overall system is studied by the modified Nyquist criterion. For given reactor parameters, stability limits are found to be identical to those for a point reactor."
"A procedure is presented here to design a noninteracting control system for a coupled core nuclear reactor. Simple methods are given to compute Q matrix and compensation. A computer program is developed to facilitate the design for large nuclear reactors."
"This paper examines the stability of linear homogeneous distributed-parameter reactor systems using the familiar root-loci method commonly used by control system engineers. The result provides information on the absolute stability as well as the relative stability of the reactor systems."
"In-core power distribution measurements are made in the Connecticut-Yankee and Zorita reactor cores by means of movable miniature fission chambers, and in-core thermocouples. The movable miniature fission chambers traverse the entire active length of selected fuel assemblies to provide a three-dimensional measure of the relative power distribution within the reactor core. In addition, chromel-alumel thermocouples are located above preselected fuel assemblies to measure the outlet temperature which is proportional to the integrated relative fuel assembly power sharing. These two in-core systems are serving as prototypes for other Westinghouse plants now under construction or on order."
"A general description of the Neutron Monitoring System will be presented. The functions and neutronics response of each subsystem will be described. The operational and safety functions will be discussed and a description of the detectors and signal conditioning electronic functions will be given."
"In a reactor supplied power generating plant, one of the means conventionally used to monitor reactor power is a neutron flux monitoring system. The pressurized-water-reactor instrumentation systems have included ex-core neutron (leakage neutrons) monitors and have traditionally used three-range systems. The three ranges have been required because the flux values covered approximately 11 decades and the dynamic range of the available instruments was limited. The C-E neutron flux monitoring system applies the concept of wide and narrow range (two groups of instruments) monitoring of the neutron flux instead of using three ranges or groups of instruments. The system uses a total of ten channels which are subdivided into four wide-range logarithmic channels monitoring the neutron flux from source level to full reactor power level, and six linear power range channels monitoring the neutron flux from approximately 0.1 percent to full reactor power level. The four wide-range channels operate from a combination of proportional counters and fission chambers. A single output signal from each channel is produced by pulse counting techniques for the first five decades of flux values, and by mean square variation techniques up to full reactor power. This method reduces errors due to gamma background as well as resolution counting loss errors normally associated with high rate counting. The four wide-range logarithmic channels provide rate-of-change-of-power information to four reactor protective channels. The narrow (linear power) range channels operate from dual-section uncompensated ionization chambers, each section covering one half (axially) of the reactor core."
"The development of system design guidelines for reactor safety instrumentation and controls consists largely of evaluating modern practice. This paper describes such efforts at ORNL, noting difficulties in reducing the HFIR protection system practice to definitive criteria. Arguments are advanced for increasing the emphasis on informal guidance documents to supplement concise criteria."
"Duplicated digital computers will directly manipulate thle reactivity devices of the KANUPP 137 MWe HWR to match the reactor power output to the turbine demand. This paper describes the system design and testing, with emphasis on the methods of signal conditioning, the choice of sampling and control calculation frequencies, and the transformation of analog control algorithms to recursive form."
"A Common Mode Failure (CMF) study is described which supports the design basis for the Reactor Protection System on a General Electric Boiling Water Reactor. Ground rules are formulated which restrict the study to functional CMFs applied one at a time to a reactor plant subjected to initiating transients and accidents. Each outcome is traced to a stable condition and the results examined to determine that they are acceptable. CMF studies seem to parallel the development of Reliability studies and the results appear to be complimentary."
"The paper describes, briefly, some of the control and protection systems of a Westinghouse PWR. The behavior of the reactor during load change transients is depicted and the response of some of the control systems is given. The criteria used in the design of the protection system and the relationship of the various standards to the design are discussed. The application of these criteria to the protection system is illustrated by the use of two typical protection systems. Future developments in the field are considered."
"Selection of diesel generators for use as standby power supplies for nuclear generating stations utilizing light water reactors has become an uncertain and time consuming process. Better understanding of the requirements and problems involved will lead to the development of a selection process in which there is confidence and with which delays will be reduced. Requirements discussed are those established by regulatory bodies, nuclear power plant standards and plant safety analyses. Problem areas investigated are load determination, rating selection and other considerations, such as control, modes of operation and auxiliary systems. Once requirements are evaluated and problems are identified, the selection process for standby power supplies can become an organized and knowledgeable effort, free from delays and uncertainty."

  "A high-resolution magnetic data recording system has been successfully used as part of the Los Alamos program of time-of-flight neutron cross-section measurements that use an underground nuclear explosion source. The data received were recorded in frequency modulation form on a rotating hard-surfaced magnetic disc. This is a novel way of recording these data. Magnetic recording facilitates electronic digitizing of the data, since there is no need for time-consuming film reading."
"A fast coincidence circuit which operates reliably over a wide range of input-pulse amplitudes is described. The ratio of the current which is applied to the main tunnel diode when the circuit receives a noncoincident input-pulse to that when both inputs of the circuit receive coincident input-pulses, is always one to four, independent of input-pulse amplitudes. The value of the current to be applied to the main tunnel diode by input pulses is decided by the bias current of the circuit. The resolving time of the circuit is measured as 2 ns in the typical operation of the circuit and as 400 ps by adjusting input-pulse amplitudes and the bias current."
"A method for testing control system stability is presented, which is useful for finding the limit cycles of high order systems with multiple nonlinearities. The presented method is applied to the analysis of the control system of a material testing reactor, and a comparison with the method in a current literature is given."
"Detailed measurements on special gated Si p+n diodes yield the damage parameters associated with the three basic current components in p-n junctions. Recombination in the neutral bulk, recombination and generation in the space-charge region, and recombination and generation at the surface are characterized over a wide range of neutron doses and injection levels. For recombination in the neutral bulk, the lifetime damage constant is about 3 x 105 n-sec/cm2 at high injection levels and varies with dose between 103 and 104 n-sec/cm2 for low injection levels. The damage constant for the space-charge region recombination lifetime is about 5 x 105 n-sec/cm2 for forward biases in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 V and the damage constant for the generation lifetime in the space-charge region is 5 x 107 n-sec/cm2 both nearly independent of dose. The surface generation and recombination velocities are process dependent and are not a linear function of the dose. The surface generation velocity increases from about 10 cm/sec at 2 x 1011 n/cm2 to saturate at about 100 cm/sec at 1014 n/cm2 in the diodes studied here. Using these data, the grounded emitter current gain (hFE) for a Si pnp transistor (2N4872) is predicted as a function of dose and current density. Both the dose and the current density dependence of hFE, as predicted by our V-I characteristics and deduced lifetimes, are in reasonable agreement with the published specifications."
"The design techniques of prescaling counters for the automatic compression of particle measure ment data on board of spacecrafts are reviewed and new criteria are proposed, which are illustrated by examples. The standard technique of realizing logarithmic counters is criticized and alternative procedures are proposed that take into account both the effect of the statistical error, when counting events from random sources, and the efficient use of all the apriori information available about the expected counts. The resulting structure consist of a prescaling counter, where the number of stages of the prescaler that are inserted does not coincide anymore with the content of the exponent section, but is an arbitrary function of that number."
"The energy resolutions of surface barrier n-type silicon detectors counting al pha-particles were measured under the disturbance of 1.25 MeV gamma-fluxes ranging from 2.3 x 107 to 3.8 x 108 photons cm-2 sec-1 and for detectors having different total thicknesses and resistivities. The results obtained confirm the existence of a zone about 100 micron wide and external to the depletion layer of partially depleted detectors which contributes to worsen the energy resolution of the gamma-irradiated detectors by diffusion rrocesses. It is also pointed out that the energy resolution of the detectors under gamma irradiation varies with the time constants of the amplifying circuit quite differently from what is obser ved in the absence of gamma irradiation."
"The fast-neutron-induced degradation of the properties of n-channel GaAs junction field effect transistors (JFET) is estimated and the results are compared with the effects produced in n-and p-channel silicon field effect transistors. The estimated degradation of the maximum transconductance, maximum drain current, pinch-off voltage, and cutoff frequency is based on electrical measurement data taken for fast-neutron-irradiated bulk n-type GaAs samples. It is concluded that n-channel GaAs JFET's should be at least as resistant to fast neutrons as either n-or p-channel Si JFET's."

"1. The kinematic analysis of high-energy events requires, in general, particle momentum measurements with an absolute error of ±50-100 MeV/c, independent of momentum. Corresponding errors are 0.05% at 100 GeV/c, less at higher momenta. To minimize the cost of magnetic deflection of high-energy particles, improvements in angular precision, hence, in particle location accuracy, are desirable. The present analysis indicates that improving location accuracy from ±1/3 mm to ±0.1 mm is both desirable and feasible. The usefulness of still higher precision must await data on detailed systems performance. 2. For complex events, it appears likely that vidicon digitization can compete favorably in cost, convenience, and flexibility with large wire-array systems. 3. Neutral particle detectors that furnish accurate data on the location and direction of neutral particles (gamma rays, neutral hadrons) are likely to be important."
"In the past two years we have reported on the properties of large NaI(Tl) crystals as total absorption spectrometers foy electrons and γ-rays in the range 0.1 to 14 GeV1,2. We have recently made similar measurements on a NaI(Tl) spectrometer which is both larger than any we have used before and assembled in a different way. In the following paragraphs we indicate the results of our initial tests."
"A detector designed to study the charge composition of the primary cosmic radiation in the range Z = 3 to 30 has been flown on balloons during 1969. The flight is part of a program to study the charge composition in the energy range 10 to 105 GeV. The telescope consists of a four fold charge measurement using two plastic scintillators, a Cerenkov detector and a mosaic CsI(Tl) detector. The intrinsic limitations on charge resolution due to statistical fluctuations in energy loss are approached by correcting the pulse heights for geometrical effects. This is accomplished by calibrating the detector response in flight using a spark chamber to determine the particle trajectories."
"When a charged particle moving with uniform velocity v crosses the boundary between any two media with different dielectric constants, it will emit electromagnetic radiation, called transition radiation. The emitted frequency spectrum of the transition radiation covers from the optical spectrum up into the x-ray spectrum, the extent of which depends on the Lorentz factor, γ (= l/√ 1 - ß2) of the moving particle. Theory predicts 1) that the intensity of the transition radiation emitted in the optical region is proportional to log γ and 2) that the intensity of the x-ray radiation is linearly proportional to γ. Experimental verification of both these theoretical predictions will be presented and possible application of the transition radiation for the measurement of the γ of super-high energy particles will be discussed."
"The usefulness of negative electron affinity secondary emitters as detectors of particles in the high relativistic region is studied theoretically in detail. It is found that GaP(Cs) has poor secondary escape statistics, resulting in the inability to distinguish between 200 BeV/c protons and pions in single particle experiments. GaAs (Cs+[O2+ Cs]) has good escape statistics, but its active depth may be too large, and density effects are expected to set in. A GaP(1-x) - GaAs(x) heterojunction which could solve both problems is discussed. In any case, it is found that non-linear filtering of the near Landau distributed signals from secondary emitters is required in order to obtain useful particle discrimination. One feasible scheme is proposed which should allow separating 200 BeV/c protons and pions, for example, with 90% efficiency or better at near 100% confidence."
"A conductive film supports the anode wires of a multi-wire proportional type counter and a bias voltage applied through this film controls the electric field concentration around the anode wires. Because the critical operating voltage is applied through the film one has increased freedom in the mechanical design of these chambers . Two coordinates of spacial information are available with this technique. The first coordinate is the anode wire signals. The second is obtained by a grid of ribbons on the back of the anode supporting film which picks up an induced signal from the primary discharge. Spacial resolution of 1.6 mm fwhm has been measured using the induced readout ribbon grid along with 3.3 mm fwhm on the anode grid. We expect this to improve."
"A 20-plane wire chamber spectrometer utilizing capacitors as memory elements and suitable for operation in a magnetic field is described. The (parallel) wire planes are separated by 1 cm. The active areas of the chambers range in size from 120 × 120 cm2 to 200 × 240 cm2. The wire separation is 1 mm. Each readout wire is connected to a separate capacitor resulting in a 30 K-bit memory for the total system. Using FET's as gates, the capacitors are read out in 32 bit words. These words are formatted into data sets of 18 bits/spark and transferred to a PDP-9 computer. Digital processing of data is briefly described, including the computer interface and test procedures. Advantages of this system are discussed together with some performance characteristics."
"Multiwire proportional counters have proved to be very useful for a wide variety of experiments at all energies. Properties of these detectors essential in planning an experiment, e.g. their efficiency as a function of position and their output timing, have been measured. Integrated circuit amplifier-discriminators have been developed for use with multiwire arrays and operated in the typical large accelerator environment. An experiment on the scattering of pions and protons by complex nuclei has been performed with 8-inch square arrays of proportional counters used for x, y hodoscopes."
"We have constructed multi-wire proportional-counter arrays in which only every second wire operates as an anode, the others being held at the cathode potential, and have investigated their response to a particles. The variation of the sensitivity and amplification with voltage and with different geometrical arrangements is described."
"Investigations into the production of mechanical oscillations in aluminum cylinders by high energy electrons reveal that the mechanism of excitation is a \"hot rod model\" in which the shower deposits heat in the bar and the hot zone expands causing mechanical vibrations. The conversion efficiency of this process is evaluated in these experiments. The hot rod mechanism does not present a significant background for gravitational events from cosmic rays in room temperature gravitational radiation detectors."
"A new instrument concept that utilizes the principle of the Total Absorption Shower Cascade (TASC) detector is proposed for gamma ray astronomy in space. Using the TASC detector to measure the gamma ray energy and wire chamber arrays to measure the incident angle, an instrument package designed to measure gamma rays having energies greater than 100 MeV is being proposed for a large satellite such as NASA's proposed High Energy Astronomy Observatory. The proposed instrument has a minimal flux sensitivity of 2 × 10-10 photons/cm2 sr sec which will allow gamma rays with energies up to 104 GeV to be measured. An energy resolution (FWHM) for the TASC detector of ~l percent at 10 GeV has been measured and an angular resolution of ~1 degree appears to be obtainable for the wire chamber arrays."
"Recent developments in GaP(Cs)-dynode photomultipliers are reviewed. The physics of secondary emission is discussed and models are described which explain secondary emission from conventional dynode materials and from GaP(Cs) dynodes. The concept of negative electron affinity is explained in terms of an energy diagram. Device performance is reported with regard to both electron and time resolution. A general discussion of the characteristics of GaP(Cs)-dynode photomultipliers is included."
"Total transit time of the order of 1 ns with a standard deviation less than 0.1 ns, IR* better than 0.3 ns FWHM** are typical characteristics of a new type of PM designed and developed at LEP. These performances are obtained with the following applied voltages: between photocathode and oultiplier entrance :1 KV ; across the multiplier: 1 KV to 1.5 KV ; between multiplier output and collector : 2 KV The overall dimensions of the tube are maximum. diameter 40 mm, length 80 mm. The paper explains how these performances are achieved, due to a new design, comapared to the classical approach of PM. The predicted data, deduced from a computer programme (dealing with electron multiplication in channels) are compared to the experimental figures obtained from a coincidence study through a short pulse source, a time to amplitude converter and a multichannel analyzer. Some typical applications are evoked such as : high energy; physics, quantum. electronics."
 "In the scintillation mechanism for alkali iodides doped with thallous iodide: 1. Most of the luminescence, and possibly all of it, is from recombination and therefore energy transfer is predominantly from charge transport to thallium. 2. There are two modes of recombination at thallium which differ in the sequence of charge trapping at Tl+. The electron may be trapped before a mobile hole recombines with it, or the hole may be trapped before recombination with a free electron. 3. Thermal hole diffusion is an important process at room temperature and determines which mode a recombination event follows. 4. Both modes of recombination are active. 5. There is non-thermal hole trapping which is a significant part of the scintillator mechanism."
"Thallium Chloride, activated with iodides, has been found to scintillate. Photopeaks for the Cs137 .662 Mev gamma energy have been obtained with several crystals, while many other TICI crystals, prepared with different iodides of varying low concentration show smaller scintillation response. Pulse height varies with the activators used. The consistently largest output to date is measured for TICI(Be,I). A maximum pulse height of 2.5% relative to Nal(TI) has been measured. The best resolution value is 42% at .662 Mev for Cs137. The gamma ray excited luminescence agrees remarkably well with the low temperature Intrinsic luminescence of TICI at 4650 Å. A scintillation decay time of 0.2 microseconds is obtained. Having good mechanical and thermal shock resistance, high density and the highest atomic number of any scintillator known to date, Iodide activated TICI promises to be an Important new scintillator. The scintillation efficiency and decay time are sufficient for consideration in high energy counters and spectrometers."
"The field of use of gas detectors has been considerably extended through the addition of a third electrode in a parallel plane geometry. Apart from the possibility of obtaining spectrometric performances, pictures of objects emitting an X radiation may be obtained. Detection efficiency can be important when the filling gas is xenon which has a high atomic number. A polyatomic vapour must be added to ensure great electronic amplification. The localization data is provided either by a spark or by an electron avalanche. In this study we were interested in the light accompanying the electron avalanche. In this proportional mode, two kinds of information are available (a) the energy information given by the number of electrons of the avalanche head and (b) the spatial information from the light emitted during the avalanche. A coincidence measurement was made between the electric information constituted by the electrons of the avalanche head and the light information coming from the output slit of a grating monochromator. Coincidence information, which varies numerically in proportion to the number of avalanches per second, is sent to a recorder whose speed is co-related with the rotation speed of the grating. Minute by minute automatic zero reset of the recording enables a picture to be obtained by means of wave length intervals whose width is governed by the rotation speed of the grating."
"The pulse discrimination technique permits scintillators to be used for neutron spectroscopy, in the presence of gamma rays, to investigate a wide variety of problems. The influence of shape and size of stilbene and NE 213 scintillators on their gamma-ray and neutron efficiencies and on the shape correction has been investigated. The neutron efficiency and the shape correction factor enter into the spectrum conversion function which is needed to reduce a recoil-proton energy distribution to a neutron spectrum. Gamma-ray and neutron efficiencies from 0.1 to 24 MeV have been graphed as a function of length. Graphs of the shape correction factor and the spectrum conversion function, up to 24-MeV neutron energy, have been made for various dimensions and similar volumes. These graphs and the summary tables can be used to select the size and shape of a detector to minimize the spread of the correction factor over a given range of neutron energy and to increase the neutron efficiency consistent with conditions of a given experiment or application."
"Various types of time interval distributions are calculated assuming a compound Poisson law for the photoelectron emission. The experimental results obtained with the high gain first dynode photomultiplier RCA C 31000 D are discussed with reference to an exponential illumination function. Time resolution curves are measured by performing first photoelectron triggering."
"The behavior of many germanium crystals during lithium-ion drift, in terms of compensated depth W as a function of drift time t, does not follow the prediction of the equation: W = (24325684LiVt)1/2 Modification of the lithiim velocity expression to include the loss of mobile lithium ions during drift yields the expression: W = [ μLiVτ(1-e-2t/τ)]1/2 which seems to describe satisfactorily the experimental results. In addition to the loss mechanism, the effect of oxygen on lithium-ion drift mobility is considered."
"Germanium crystals used for γ-ray detectors frequently exhibit slow or non-uniform lithiumion drift. The presence of oxygen is one known cause. However, it has been found in these laboratories that in large (˜1 kg) germanium crystals grown by the Czochralski method under vacuum, the presence of a fast diffusing impurity (probably copper) also leads to variable drift. Normal, uniform drift in these crystals has been restored b9 using gallium-indium alloy as a getter at ˜800°C. The method is described in detail and the effects on crystal resistivity, dislocation density and lithium drift rate are presented. γ-ray detectors fabricated from gettered material show high resolution characteristics."
"The similarity in behaviour shown by lithium-drifted germanium and silicon detectors in recent detailed studies of their spectrometer performance over a wide temperature range1-3 suggested a comparison with the effects of temperature on the operation of other types of semiconductor detector. In this paper, a summary of the data published in the literature on temperature effects in compensated (p-i-n) and non-compensated (p-n) detectors is presented. Conditions for optimum spectrometer performance and limits to operating temperature are discussed, from experimental results and theoretical considerations."
"Various Ge(Li) detectors showing trapping effects (low energy tailing for an applied field of 103 V/cm) with uniform γ-ray irradiation have been studied using a collimated beam of 137Cs γ-rays. The following parameters have been determined : velocity, mobility, drift length and carrier lifetime. For many samples, a good agreement between experimental measurements of charge collection efficiency with the position of irradiation and calculated curves is obtained de monstrating that the trap distribution is uniform. The carrier velocities and mobilities are practically not modified in the samples showing trapping effects, but the drift lengths are lowered and, as a consequence, the carrier lifetimes. Various-measurements including infrared transmission spectra, etch-pit distributions, electron lifetimes have been made on the starting P-type crystals. Results are presented showing a valuable correlation between the electron lifetimes measured at 77°K by the pulse charge method and detector performance."
"A comprehensive program of germanium single crystal growth and the evaluation of such material for use as Ge(Li) detectors is described. The effects of crystal growth parameters such as pull rate, cooling rate, crucible material, and atmosphere, among others, are analyzed by a number of techniques. These techniques include the standard etch-pit density, resistivity profile and minority carrier lifetime measurements as well as others which have been developed at this Laboratory and have been shown to be extremely useful in characterizing the quality of single crystal germanium for Ge(Li) detectors"
"The mechanisms responsible for the degradation of the performance of Ge(Li) detectors (which include the effects of uniform trapping, non-uniform trap distribution, and locally weak collection fields) are considered, and simulated spectra have been computed. Experimental measurements have been made to identify these sources of degradation. The important results include a measurement of the effective capture cross sections of the most important traps and a determination of the main sources of non-uniform trap distribution and weak collection fields in Ge(Li) detectors."
"A theoretical study of the charge collection properties of coaxial Ge(Li) detectors is presented. Normalized relationships are derived, which can easily be handled for a great number of practical cases. A geometrical factor g = ri/w (ri - internal radius of the coaxial counter, w - depletion layer width) has been introduced. The case of planar detectors can be derived if great values are given to g. Calculations have been performed assuming a 1/r r field variation, and a punctual single event gamma ray energy loss (electron-hole pair created in a point). Concerning the variation of the charge carrier drift velocity vs the electric field, two kinds of approximation have been used in the calculations : variable velocity (VVA) and constant velocity approximation (CVA). Trapping has also been taken into account by assuming an uniform distribution of trapping centers throughout the detector sensitive volume. For different interaction points, geometrical factors and trapping parameters, the relationships for the charge carrier collection efficiency (peak position of monoenergetic spectra in the case of a collimated radiation beam), as well as the shapes of current and charge pulses have been established and plotted. The prompt coincidence curves (using the charge pulse leading edge timing) are calculated by evaluating the probability distribution of the time at which the charge signal crosses a discriminating level. The influence on these curves of the geometrical factor, the discriminator tevet, the noise and the trapping parameters is taken into account and discussed."
"Over the years Fano factor measurements have been published which demonstrate a steady decline in the values with time. In fact, the reduction in these values is so monotonic that an extrapolation to 1980 suggests that the Fano factor is completely negligible, and that all (non-avalanching) ionization detectors should show nearly perfect resolution (and that--to avoid being tarred and feathered by our colleagues--we should hasten to move on to another research field). Obviously, this is not the actual case in nature, but in many of the previous works the value has been published as \"the\" Fano factor, justifying a healthy skepticism on our part. In this paper we try and show what we think has been happening; we derive from our own theory for ∈ (the average amount of energy expended in producing an electron-hole pair) expressions which suggest that the Fano factor in both silicon and germanium may be very nearly equal to 0.05 ; and we show with our experimental data, as well as with a reanalysis of the data of other workers, that experiment is very nearly approaching this value. Finally, in trying to reveal what we think we understand about the Fano factor situation, we also reveal the areas in which our understanding is very poor. These observations support the value of further properly corrected experiments and the need for further very basic theoretical work. Isn't this all fun?"
"The impact of semiconductor detectors on x-ray spectroscopy is reviewed with particular emphasis on areas where this technique promises significant advantages. Applications in the fields of scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe analysis, x-ray diffraction, x-ray fluorescence analysis, and x-ray astronomy are described. The effects of various detector system performance parameters such as resolution, count rate capability, stability, efficiency, etc., on the analytical usefulness of the system are examined in detail. The fundamental and practical state-of-the-art limitations on detector system performance are discussed in terms of their present and future impact on the usefulness of the energy analyzing technique for x-ray spectroscopy."
"Lithium drifted silicon coaxial detectors have been fabricated from 19 mm diameter material with volumes up to 5 cm3. Essentially single line response, the double escape peak, is observed for gamma rays interacting by pair production. Resolutions (FWHM) of 5 keV and approximately 10 keV have been observed for incident gamma rays of 2.62 and 7.64 MeV. Slices, 2 to 3 mm thick, have been taken from such coaxial detectors and used as low capacity, high resolution X-ray detectors. A FWHM of 300 eV has been obtained at 6.4 keV using a detector with an active area slightly greater than 200 mm2."
"Carrier capture and re-emission effects in semiconductor nuclear particle detectors are characterized by a trapping time τ+ and detrapping time τD. Measurement of these quantities as a function of temperature gives information on capture cross-sections a and activation energies, ET. Trapping and detrapping processes are field dependent. These effects have been investigated in Si(Li) and Ge(Li) detectors and are discussed in relation to operating temperature and detector resolution. The performance of Ge(Li) and CdTe detectors is evaluated in view of the influence of trapping effects."
"A solution regrowth technique for growing P+ and N+ contacts on high purity germanium is described. Copper contamination of the high purity germanium is minimized by using KCN to remove copper from the surface of the germanium and by the gettering ability of molten indium in contact with the germanium. Diodes with leakage currents as low as 3 × 10-11 amp for 2000 volts applied to a fully depleted 4 mm thick detector have been fabricated. Preliminary measurements show that the resolution obtained with these diodes is comparable to the best Li drifted germanium detectors at 60 keV and 122 keV. Diodes have been warmed to room temperature as many as five times with no degradation in resolution."
"Highly perfect and pure single crystalline CdTe, grown by the traveling heater method, has been used to fabricate gamma ray detectors. Using tellurium as the solvent, carrier concentrations as low as 5 × 109 have been obtained in as-grown material. The detectors were formed by using back-to-back Schottky barriers on opposite sides of the CdTe slice. Operation over the temperature range from + 125 to -150 °C has been observed. Excellent agreement of the experimental spectra with a theoretical model which considers the mean free drift length of both electrons and holes has been obtained. Although the energy resolution is not yet of spectroscopic quality, the detector performance is more than adequate for application to some practical devices."
"The integral expression, which gives the probability of a scattered gamma ray causing a coincidence count between the center and one of the side detectors, is derived using the assumptions of only a Compton scattering in the center detector and a photo-electric reaction in one of the end detectors, the necessity of leaving at least the minimum detectable amount of energy in both detectors, and the fact that only a certain proportion of the gamma rays leave the center detector with just one scattering; secondary scattering has not been included in this calculation. The calculated asymmetry for the incident energy range .42 to 1.36 Mev. agrees well with the experimental result, and compares favorably with those calculated by Metzger and Deutsch for more conventional polarimeter designs."
"Coaxial as well as planar Ge(Li) γ-ray detectors housed in separate cryostats have been operated in parallel and as a summing Compton spectrometer. The linear signals from two detectors were direct coupled into a single charge-sensitive preamplifier, thus eliminating the need for matching electronic gain and linearity of two separate channels. The full-energy peak efficiency of two parallel coaxial detectors is nearly equal to the sum of the efficiencies of the individual detectors. Similar increase in efficiency was also observed for double-escape peaks when two small planar detectors were paralleled. The FWHM of the 1.33 MeV 60Co line was 2.94 keV in the parallel mode as compared with 2.23 and 2.38 keV for the constituent 22cc coaxial detectors. When the latter detectors were used as a summing Compton spectrometer, the Compton edge was completely eliminated. The peak-to-Compton ratio in a 137Cs spectrum was 25:1 in the singles mode and 125:1 in the coincidence mode. However, in the complex Th C\" spectrum the Compton spectrometer was not very effective in resolving a weak low energy line from the continuum of several intense γ-rays of higher energy. Thus, one large, high resolution detector or several in parallel is not only simpler and more efficient, but may also be more effective than the summing Compton spectrometer."
"The attractiveness of silicon avalanche radiation detection systems lies in the following properties: (1) Extremely low noise and low background counting capability, which is maintained to temperatures as high as 100°C, without resorting to coincidence techniques. (2) Sensitivity to virtually the entire range of nuclear radiations and energies with highest efficiency concentrated in the low energy or soft radiation region without requirement for cooling. (3) Ruggedness and miniaturizeability-a characteristic shared with other semiconductor detectors--but, in addition, providing a larger degree of usefulness in extra-laboratory applications due, primarily, to the high signal level from the detector. These characteristics make avalanche systems potentially quite valuable in nuclear medicine, particularly for in vivo detection of lower energy radiations. This paper will describe a program that was undertaken to fabricate ten prototype avalanche detector instruments for collaborative research purposes with investigators in the fields of nuclear medicine and radiobiology. All ten instruments are currently in the hands of such researchers. The specific areas of investigation are varied and interesting, with a number being rather exciting from the standpoint of being new accomplishments, i.e., avalanche technology appears to be making possible some measurements and procedures not considered feasible heretofore. Examples of specific applications being investigated are transmission bone scanning, tumor detection and diagnosis (opthalmic and skin types), organ scanning by x-ray fluorescence techniques, tooth enamel density measurements and soil water content and pressure determinations. Some very preliminary results are available on several of the above studies."
"The use of small solid state detectors for behavioral studies is described. These detectors can be inserted in holders cemented to the skull of freely moving animals thus enabling the determination of uptake of radioactive matermal in an area of the brain. By injecting P32 labelled Na3PO4, the rate of incorporation of phosphate in the brain under different behavioral conditions such as sleep anesthesia, learning, etc. can be followed. The advantages of this method are the repeated measurements on the same animal, the use of live animals for both psychological and physiological studies, the possibility of kinetic and turnover studies in the brain, blood, and in principle, other organs. Using the uptake of P32 together with studies involving other isotopes such as the stable isotope O18, an estimate of the energyrequirements of the brain can be made. The detector is a lithium drifted silicon device mounted in an electroform nickel tube of 2mm O.D. and a wall thickness of ≤ 25 microns. The detector is coated with 3 microns of parylene and secured in the nickel tube with an RTV potting compound. The major components of the preamplifier are: an FET, a transistor, three resistors and three capacitors mounted behind the detector in the probe. Performance characteristics and results will be described."
"The paper reviews the progress made in the development of large diameter germanium crystals for gamma-ray spectrometry. These are vacuum pulled and have been shown to be consistently free of oxygen. Planar devices of 40 sq.cm. area and depletion thicknesses of 8 mm have given an energy resolution better than 3.7 KeV at 1.33 MeV. The relationship between detector performance and crystal properties is examined for possible correlation."
"The gamma response of CdTe surface barrier detectors fabricated from semi-insulating material is analyzed. Small devices (10 mm3 to 15 mm3) from vapor grown crystals are capable at room temperature of resolving photopeaks at 90% charge collection efficiency for gamma emitters ranging in energy from 122 keV for 57Co to 1.33 MeV for 60Co. A resolution of 16% (FWHM) has been obtained with 137Cs (662 keV). Incomplete charge collection due to heavy trapping degrades resolution and limits the size of present devices. Larger devices (≈l cm3) prepared from melt crystals, although quite efficient to gammas (80% to 60Co), cannot resolve photopeaks. Their performance for straight counting applications is limited by a temperature dependent count rate, polarization at low temperatures and thermal noise at high temperatures. Detrapping of electrons and holes is necessary to prevent polarization at low temperatures and may be useful in extending the high temperature limit."
"A Monte-Carlo model for investigating sequential gamma scattering and for predicting sum-coincidence and sum-only detector performance has been developed in order to assess the Compton suppression capabilities of Ge(Li) detectors which accept only multiple gamma interaction sequences. Calculated performance for a concentric cylindrical detector shows good agreement with experimentally observed sum-coincidence spectrometer (SCS) behavior. Calculations were made for hypothetical germanium detectors of cylindrical volumes from 7. 1 cc. to 28.3 cc., and for gamma energies of 320 keV to 2754 keV. The requirement of multiple scattering is shown to eliminate only a minor portion of the total-energy gamma events. Effects of detector volume are characterized, and the location and thickness of dead layers separating active detector regions are shown to be important to SCS performance. Calculations of the energy partitioning between detector volumes for coincidence events indicate that the \"backscattering\" mode is not the dominent mechanism for good event sequences as has been postulated, and that good and bad event sequences are highly localized on the two-parameter spectrum of the energy output from each detector for coincidence events. The relationship of the calculations to detector performance is given."
"It has been our experience during the past few years that LiD silicon detectors can be produced with depths up to not more than 7mm on a production basis and up to about double this depth as a laboratory project. With the installation of several machines producing protons of energies in excess of 50MeV, standard SiLiD detectors with depths to 5mm became unable to provide energy-linear signals for many experiments. Further, deeper detectors present problems due to their higher voltages of operation and to the long transit time for carriers produced by the ionizing radiation. This paper describes a new form of LiD silicon detector which combines the advantages of large sensitive depth (25mm), thin window (less than 0.5 micron) and rapid sweep-out (less than 50nS). Construction details are given. The device is arranged so that the direction of field produced by detector bias is at right angles to the line of flight of experimental particles. A protected thin wind. ow is obtained by a silicon oxide process; active areas up to 200mm2 are achieved by use of two wafers, produced by the diffused-contact process, and placed face-to-face. Resolutions for medium energy protons have now been achieved of small fractions of one per cent. The device gives total energy measurements on alphas up to 20nMeV, protons to 80MeV. The paper describes the significant process details together with some parameter measurements."
"The usefulness of image intensifiers in the study of X-ray diffraction patterns has been demonstrated in a number of laboratories. Advantages arise from the fact that usable patterns can be obtained with a marked economy of X-ray exposure campared with conventional film recording or sequential diffractometer techniques, making possible the study of materials very susceptible to radiation damage and systems exhibiting dynamic characteristics which limit permissible dosage or exposure times. In addition, the reduction of time required for the recording of a pattern permits studies of families of crystals with large unit cell size containing many diffraction spots. Various X-ray sensitive cathode arrangements are described and compared. Image intensifiers and read-out techniques available are discussed. Results have been obtained for certain organic crystals demonstrating the capabilities of a system that has reduced the time required for certain exposures by a factor of several hundred."
"Further progress has been made with a direct recording system of X-ray diffraction patterns from single crystals. In this system the pattern is formed on a phosphor screen and viewed by a T.V. camera tube whose video output is digitised and presented to a computer. Earlier work had shown that with a sufficiently high degree of light amplification between the phosphor and and the T.V. camera, individual 8keV quantum scintillations could be detected and moderately weak patterns could be displayed on a T.V. monitor. However, for quantitative work on weak patterns the limit is set by the quantum noise due to the low X-ray flux; consequently, in the present system the camera tube, which is now an Image Isocon, is operated in an integrating mode. After each 'exposure', during which the reading beam is switched off, the integrated charge pattern on the target of the Isocon is read out in a strobing fashion: the target is scanned at normal speeds but the beam is switched on only at those points where diffraction spots are known to be situated. The charge image of a diffraction spot is neutralised when the spot has been scanned, i.e. the read-out from the camera is destructive. It has been found that, owing to slight crystal misorientation and to aberrations in the light-and electron-optical systems, the positions of the diffraction spots can only be predicted approximately from the lattice spacings and initial orientation of the crystal: a computer-controlled search for the spots is, therefore, necessary."
"High gain, multi-stage cascade image intensifiers with Sb (KNa) bi-alkali input photocathodes exhibit exceptionally low dark current. Because of the imaging properties of these tubes, the spatial distribution of dark current events, especially those involvirf instantaneous multielectron emission, can be investigated to yield information on the causes of dark current sources which are not related to the thermal conditions of the photocathode."
"Multiple diode arrays of the type developed for optical image sensing in vidicon-type TV camera tubes have been investigated as two-dimensional position sensitive detectors of single charged particles. The approximately half-inch square arrays consist of more than 700,000 diffused silicon diodes. The array is read out by a scanning electron beam. With such a system we have observed individual pulses from helium ions alpha particles and fission fragments in the 0.5 to 50 MeV energy range. The spatial resolution of the system is observed to be about 30 microns for the lower energies."
"We have observed that the application of an electric field across samples of cellulose nitrate during irradiation by alpha particles enhances the formation of etchable tracks. The track formation efficiency has been studied as a function of the strength of the electric field for alpha particles energies from 2.75 to 5.0 MeV. Both the number of etchable tracks and the amount of damage along individual tracks have been found to be enhanced by the application of an electric field. Approximately the same enhancement is observed either if the field is applied during irradiation by alpha particles or if the field is applied, then turned off before the irradiation is initiated. It is hypothesized that phenomena, associated with corona discharge in the air near the surface of the dielectric sample, is responsible for the observed enhancement. The present results are dominated by chemical effects which eclipse any indication of enhancement due directly to the application of an electric field."
"A new method was developed for determining the position of ionizing events by measuring the risetime of output pulses from detectors having high resistance collectors. Basically, these detectors are distributed RC lines; information about the location of an ionizing event is obtained from the analysis of the frequency spectrum of the detector output pulse, and the energy loss of this event in the detector is measured by analyzing the amplitude of the same output pulse. Three typical prototype detectors were constructed and tested in a series of imaging and diffraction experiments using ionizing radiation. The spatial uncertainty for collimated 210Po alpha particles was 0.15 mm fwhm for a 200-mm-long proportional detector. The spatial uncertainty for collimated 20-kev x rays was 0.5 mm fwhm for a 400-mm-long detector. A two-dimensional system using parallel wires was developed and evaluated. With only four preamplifiers and relatively simple shaping and timing circuitry, 24,000 resolution elements (measured at fwhm) were obtained with a 30-wire counter having a sensitive area of 75 × 120 mm2. These position-sensitive detectors are well suited for application in the life sciences for the localization of radioactive tracers in medical studies or in the structure determination of large organic molecules, with x-ray or neutron diffraction; in fluorescent x-ray or neutron spectroscopy; small-angle scattering experiments with x rays or neutrons.; magnetic spectroscopy of protons and other charged particles; two-dimensional chromatography; x-ray astronomy; and fission physics experiments."
"An underwater Cerenkov detector has been tested. The results indicate that one phototube can observe about 100 m3 of water target. Use of a light trap increases the effective area of the phototube, thus giving a uniform response within this volume. However, losses in the trap restrict counting to events of higher energy."
 "Measurements of pulse height distributions, gain and photon detection efficiency have been made for channel electron multipliers in the soft x-ray region. In the case of channel arrays, double exponential pulse height distributions have been found, and contact noise problems encountered. The variation of detection efficiency with angle of the incident beam and the uniformity of gain and efficiency over the cathode face have been studied. Results are given of a preliminary investigation of array operating lifetime. The detection efficiency over the cathode of a coned single channel was measured, and a comparison for angular variation between coned and plain cathode detectors is presented."
"Methods of one and two dimensional x-ray image dissection using a channel multiplier array are discussed in which the position of incidence of any detected photon can be found, within the limits of the electronic dead time. Results for one dimensional systems in which spatial resolutions of 50 pm have been achieved and of a prototype two dimensional system having a similar resolution are reported and further developments and alternative methods of dissection are considered."
"We have designed, built, and tested an instrument for flight in an Aerobee sounding rocket which will measure the intensity of diffuse cosmic x rays in the range 44-100 Å while avoiding the systematic problems associated with counter resolution, low-energy cosmic-ray electrons, and ultraviolet radiation. The instrument employs a single reflection off a parabolic mirror to eliminate all high-energy x rays and soft electrons. The detector is a gas-flow proportional counter with a thin polypropylene window. The window coating and counter design provide a very low ultraviolet sensitivity."
"Many physical and biological phenomena can be described through processes obtained by a transformation of the Poisson process. Such processes have been simulated by the computer for various amplitude distributions and response functions which are common for processing of signals from nuclear detectors. The following amplitude distributions have been analyzed: delta function, gaussian, exponential, rectangular, and typical nuclear spectra. The system impulse response functions can have arbitrary shapes, such as exponential, RC integrated and/or differentiated, cusp, bipolar, etc. The following cases have been analyzed: continuous time series; pulsed time series (pulsed accelerator case); pulse shaping networks for minimal distortions at high rates; pile-up rejection systems; shot noise; systems with finite resolving time. A large number of cases have been simulated and systematically investigated, and probability density functions for each case are shown."
"An automatic dead time correction technique for multichannel pulse height analyzers that does not make use of the usual live time correction has recently been proposed by J. Harms. In order to study the validity of this new correction technique, a Monte Carlo code was written to simulate the response of multichannel pulse height analyzers, incorporating both the Harms and standard live time correction techniques, to a variety of pulse height spectra. Simulated pulse height spectra of the type one might encounter from nuclear radiation detectors under a variety of count rate conditions were generated by the code. It was found that the Harms correction technique gave valid results in all cases tested, whereas the standard live time correction technique did not work properly when the spectral shape changed drastically during the course of the measurement."
"For delayed coincidence experiments using NaI(Tl) scintillation counters, first photoelectron triggering (FPET) has been practicable since the advent of the RCA 8575. Using FPET, improved time resolution at low y ray energies was first demonstrated by Lynch, who also described his results by a model that fails to take into account the photomultiplier response. Using FPET, we have done systematic experiments from 6-511 keV for three different crystal sizes. We describe our results quantitatively by a simple model that takes into account the statistics of photoelectron production and the photomultiplier response, similar to El-Wahab and Kane. From the model calculations, we conclude that with present photomultipliers and NaI(Tl) scintillators, further improvements in resolution cannot be expected. The major difficulty is not the light output of NaI(Tl), but the single electron response of the photomultiplier."
"Ge(Li) detectors used for gamma rays detection deliver signals with random parameters in noise. Timing studies with such pulses must take into account the two sources of errors; random shape and noise. This has not been made until now. In this paper, we use the \"maximum likelihood method\" which has been widely studied in communication theory. It mainly consists in the search of a set of parameters which maximizes the \"likelihood function\". This condition gives the minimum values of variances of estimated parameters. With the likelihood method we have determined, in the case of Ge(Li) detectors for a random shape (but sinqle interaction) and noise, the expression of the likelihood functions. If an electronic system could give this function as response to Ge(Li) pulses it would be the best pulse Forocessor, but it is obviously impossible to realize. However the method qives the bounds of accuracy of measurements theoretically possible : For planar pulses, this bound is found to be proportional to the inverse of the expectation of the energy of the delivered current. For coaxial pulses, one derives bounds in low and high electric field regions. Results are not so simple as in the previous case and additive terms appear in the formulas with the expectation of the energy of the current. Rather surprising results are obtained : timing nearly as good for planar pulses could be approached."
"In low noise preamplifiers for nuclear and X-ray spectroscopy, a major source of electronic noise is the lossy glass insulator in the header of the input junction field effect transistor. Substitution of low loss ceramic headers for glass headers and encapsulation with unselected Union Carbide and Texas Instruments 2N 4416 JFET chips decreases total preamplifier electronic noise from 330 eV to 200 eV (FWHM)Si at room temperature. Further reduction in noise is accomplished by cooling the JFET. Preamplifier noise decreases to 125 eV for the TI JFET and to 160 eV for the UC JFET at their optimum temperatures. These noise values were obtained with a feedback resistor and with 4 μsec RC main amplifier pulse shaping time constants. The TI JFET exhibits a narrow minimum in its noise vs temperature curve, therefore it is essential that temperature be controlled quite precisely. A JFET temperature control system is described. Additional results concerning chemical contamination of JFET silicon chips by glass headers are presented. Finally, a method of decreasing noise still further by eliminating the feedback resistor and by using a pulsed light feedback system is discussed."
"Charge amplification without the conventional charge leak resistor is considered. It is shown that any charge leak mechanism based on continuous conduction current would contribute noise. Pulsed conduction of current from the amplifier input avoids this problem. A method for pulsed removal of charge is proposed here, based on charge pumping via the detector capacitance and the gate-channel junction of the input field-effect transistor. In this configuration the detector is the only component connected to the gate of the field-effect transistor, and these two are the only components required to be in the cryostat. The detector capacitance serves also as feedback capacitance."
"The use of two-dimensional gamma-ray spectrometry is becoming a standard radiochemical technique for the analysis of cascaded gamma emitters. Coincidence and noncoincidence events from a sample station detector pair are usually stored and displayed in a rectangular data array. Half of this array is redundant if both detectors are identical and matched as to energy response, and another half of the array may be nonessential if the energy scale is adjusted so that all sum peaks of interest have a total energy that is less than the full scale energy of the X and Y axes. The four input multiplexer is a digital device which allows one to feed pulses from four two-dimensional sample stations into one ADC pair and 4096 memory and still record all essential data. Further, the noncoincident data from each sample station is recorded in 240 channels to provide improved singles energy resolution."
"The analysis of a diode gamma ray spectrogram is based on the research and study of the various total absorption peaks evidenced by the study of the relative dispersion of the contents in a limited group of successive channels. The areas which correspond statistically to static phenomena enable a continuous base line to be determined which will serve as a \"substratum\" for the various peaks. This method, based on a test of agreement with Poisson's law of distribution, has the advantage of not bringing in the shape of the peak, remaining applicable at all levels of activity without requiring any smoothing and being applicable generally in the analysis of any sampled data where the occurrences to be detected appear as so many discontinuities in a random continuum. Full automation is only possible if the various data are correctly prepared The results of each measurement are initially supplied with a label line summarizing the conditions of that particular measurement (date, duration, type of measurement) and providing the essential information on the measured object (references, date, origin, amount, etc.). This information, to which is added the exact calibration conditions, is grouped into a single so called standard text, before the start of any processing. During this operation every possible check is made upon the whole of this information, so as to make the checks in the program itself all the lighter."
"A method for semi-automatically generating sodium-iodide scintillation spectrometer response function matrices is presented. Experimental standard source spectra were used to systematically obtain normalized Compton continua. The normalized continua were indirectly interpolated to obtain the desired response function matrix. The standard source normalization and the indirect interpolation was carried out through the use of a comprehensive pulse-height gain-changing algorithm."

  "The radiation resistance of microcircuit systems has been studied by testing separate microcircuits and using statistics based on known data of the transistor damage coefficients. The logic gates with bipolar transistors can be characterized by a transistor base transit time, tb, defined as tb=0.2/fα where fα is the alpha cutoff frequency. When tbø < 105ns/cm2 the separate gates almost certainly survive, failure almost certainly occuring when tbø > 107ns/cm2. The quantity ø is the fast neutron exposure of a reactor spectrum (E > 10 keV)."
"Methods of calculating and of illustrating the transient response of chains of coupled resonators are discussed. Such calculations are particularly useful in understanding the rf field behavior in linear accelerator structures, both of the drift tube and waveguide or coupled cavity types. Resonator chains are also employed in certain kinds of filters and delay lines; the methods to be discussed are applicable in these areas, as well. A frequency adjustment is presented which permits difference equations with a large time step to accurately represent the differential equations for slightly lossy coupled resonators."
"A new method for measuring fast-neutron fluences using CdS has recently been developed. The technique consists of detecting induced conductivity resulting from the beta decay of radioisotopes which are produced by the neutron irradiation. In previous studies of radioactive decay effects in these detectors it was necessary to correct the conductivity data for effects associated with radiation damage (defects). In this study, electrical changes associated with neutron-induced defects have been minimized by annealing the detectors at 300°C before measuring electrical changes resulting from radioactive decay. The measured conductivity following annealing is just the induced conductivity from beta decay, and no further corrections for radiation damage are required. These results also (1) confirm the accuracy of the previous correction procedure, and (2) show that differences in the radioactive decay rate constants and the rate constants determined from the associated electrical changes, which have been observed for some detectors, are not necessarily due to errors introduced by that correction procedure. Given in this paper is a brief discussion of some of the general characteristics of CdS neutron detectors as well as a detailed description of the annealing experiments."
"New analyzing systems will have megachannel resolution without sacrificing speed of data collection. Here, a survey and comparison of different methods and new proposals to achieve this goal are given. The following systems and their basic principles of operation are described: The use of newly developed rotating memories; a disc system with fixed track addressing per rotation; random track addressing through programming; random track addressing using a special controller; disc buffered system, with continuous updating; time of flight measurement through random modulation and cross-correlation; real time calculation of cross-correlation; the Fourier method."

 "A fast low-power-drain logic system has been developed for use in nuclear experiments on scientific satellites. The system consists of a compatible set of AND and NAND gates, pulse generators, delays and bistables. Each basic circuit unit has a response time in the 10 nanosecond range and power drain in the 2.0 milliwatt range. The basic units may be directly interconnected to form a required logic system. The basic circuit units, their use in a typical coincidence anti-coincidence system and their possible use in event priority and wide dynamic range pulse height analyzer systems is described."
"The influence of several parameters related to the detector,. such as depletion layer thickness, external radius of coaxial counters, applied electric field on the timing properties of planar and two open ended coaxial Ge(Li) detectors is investigated. Besides, the role of the electronical conditions is studied."
"An instrument designed to measure the directional properties of cosmic ray propagation in the energy range 1-63 MeV per nucleon during solar active years is described. This instrument has been flown on the interplanetary space vehicles Pioneers 8 and 9. The detector package is discussed with regard to its mechanical, electrical, and data conditioning properties. In-flight calibration procedures are briefly discussed."
"A new method of temperature compensation for a dc logarithmic amplifier is presented. By this method temperature effect on both parallel shift and slope variance of log I vs. VBE curve can be compensated easily by using only one compensating resistor of copper wire wound type. (hereafter called parallel and slope compensations.) An absolute compensation condition can be determined for each type of logarithmic transistors, like silicon NPN, germanium PNP irrespective of current measuring range. The temperature dependence of the logarithmic amplifier is reduced to 0.01 decade for the temperature range from 0°C to 50°C and the current range from 10-11 to 10-3A."

 "This publication presents standard test procedures for Geiger-Müller counter radiation detectors. These detectors, originally announced by Geiger and Müller in 1928, represented a major step forward in the detection and counting of individual radioactive events. Standard test procedures are desirable so that measurements may have the same meaning to all manufacturers and users. This Standard is not intended to imply that all tests described herein are mandatory, but only that such tests as are carried out on Geiger-Müller counters should be performed in accordance with the procedures given herein."

 "We report here on the interface state densities at the Si/Silicon Oxynitride (SiON) interface before and after ionizing irradiation, on extended B T tests on Si/SiON capacitors, and on the fabrication and properties of SiON passivated bipolar transistors and P-channel IGFETs. Preliminary data are also presented for gold and copper diffused capacitor structures. The fast state density Nfs after a 1/2 hr. anneal in H2 at 900°C is approximately 8x1010 eV-1 cm-2 near midgap, and increases into the high 1011 eV-1 cm-2 range near the band edges. After an absorbed dose of 1.3 Mrads, the densities near midgap had increased by a factor of 1.3, but showed little change near the band edges. B-T tests under negative bias at l.6×106 V/cm and at temperatures up to 330°C showed a Vfb drift of 2-3 V to more positive values during the first hour, which did not change thereafter; very little drift occurred under positive bias and the same test condition. Test duration was 63 hours for either polarity of bias. This BT-stability, observed on Si/SiON/Al structures, is often lost after gold wire thermocompression bonding. Si/SiON/ tungsten-gold contacts showed no deterioration after thermocompression bonding. SiON passivated type 16F NPN bipolar transistors had initial gain characteristics similar to SiO2 passivated controls, whereas their tolerance to ionizing radiation was much greater. Degradation of hFE to 50% of the initial gain occurred for the SiO2 passivated devices after an absorbed dose of about 1 Mrad and for the SiON passivated devices after 35 Mrads."
"A dependence of surface degradation induced by ionizing radiation in matched oxide-passivated silicon planar epitaxial transistors on junction fringing electric field strength present during exposure is reported. The electric field strength and gamma dose dependence are investigated of the decrease in the forward current gain, hFE (as reflected by the increase in the surface recombination current component), the increase in the surface recombination velocity (as reflected by the increase in the reciprocal of the minority carrier lifetime), and the increase in junction capacitance. Empirical prediction equations have been derived, for matched devices, correlating the normalized base current increase and the normalized surface recombination velocity increase with the average junction electric field strength present during irradiation and the total gamma dose. The ionizing radiation induced surface recombination and surface channel components are analyzed from a study of the reciprocal slope term, \"n\", obtained from forward and inverse configuration current-voltage data."
"Complementary-symmetry metal-oxide semiconductor (COS/MOS) inverter circuits have been fabricated with aluminum oxide as channel insulator. This oxide was formed either by plasma-anodization of Al or by vapor deposition at 450°C using Al-isopropoxide. The RCA CD-4007 circuit configuration was used for these studies. The inverters were subjected to ionizing radiation with the applied gate biases encountered under normal operation (0 and +10 volts). For all units tested, the shifts in the inverter characteristics were due to shifts in the threshold voltages of the individual transistors. No measurable deterioration in gain due to interface state generation was observed. These results confirm the expected radiation hardness measured previously with MOS capacitors. Based on the net voltage shifts in the transfer characteristics of the complementary inverters, plasma-grown A12O3 shows an increase of more than an order of magnitude in hardness over units with SiO2 channel oxide. The hardness of units with deposited A12O3 was found to be intermediate to these. The increased hardness of A12O3 over SiO2 is attributed, at least in part, to the presence of trapping centers for negative charge. This serves to balance the positive trapped oxide charge so that a considerable reduction in the net oxide charge is attained."
 "Determination of the distribution of oxide charge and interface properties is important to an understanding of oxide charging phenomena such as that produced by irradiation. The physical mechanism dominating the voltage dependence of photoinjected currents in SiO2 is the scattering of electrons in the region of the oxide between the injecting electrode and the image force potential maximum. Since the spatial position of the potential maximum depends on the electric field resulting from space charge in the oxide as well as the field due to the applied voltage, analysis of the V-I characteristics of photoinjected currents can provide information about the spatial location of oxide charge. Presented in this paper are the results of an analysis of the effects of oxide space charge on the voltage dependence of photoinjected currents. It is shown that charge distribution in SiO2 can be nondestructively profiled over a range from about ten to several hundred angstroms from the injecting electrode. Since photoinjection V-I characteristics depend on electric field at the potential maximum in the oxide, whereas C-V characteristics depend on the field just inside the semiconductor, analysis of both characteristics permits distinction between charge in t e oxide a distance greater than about 10 Å and charge located at the interface."
"Films of Al2O3 sandwiched between thin metal electrodes have been irradiated using continuous radiation from a cobalt target x-ray tube operated at 35 kV. Current through the A12O3 films was measured as a function of voltage and time during x-irradiation. Implications of these measurements regarding radiation induced charge trapping in oxide films are discussed."
"By irradiation of the surface structure of silicon planar transistors with a narrow electron beam adjusted parallel to the pn-junctions of the devices it was possible to show in a very direct manner that the increase in base current occurs only if the beam is directed to the immediate vicinity of the emitter-base pn-junction. Subjecting the collector-base pn-junction and the remainder of the transistor surface to radiation has no effect on the current gain. A comparison of the radiation damage to bipolar silicon planar transistors in metal packages and plastic envelopes shows that the packaging method has a strong influence on the degradation in current gain if the pn-junctions are reverse-biased during the irradiation. The resistance of bipolar planar transistors to ionizing radiation can be improved considerably if the device is subjected to a high dose of ionizing radiation under conditions at which the damage anneals out immediately. The cause for this phenomenon mainly is a decrease of the concentration of interface states effected by this treatment. Reductions of the increase in base/collector current ratio of one order of magnitude have been obtained."
"The conventional Ebers-Moll model does not provide an accurate representation of the saturation region characteristics for transistors with a high resistivity collector region. Accurate one-dimensional calculations of device characteristics indicate that the size of the effective collector resistance is modulated at high currents by the extension of the neutral base into the collector region. Based on this analysis, a non-linear collector resistance is added to the Ebers-Moll equivalent circuit model to provide a more accurate representation of the characteristics in the saturation region."
"A radiation-hardened power amplifier using switchedmode techniques to effect linear amplification is described. The amplifier--consisting of a modulator, saturating switches, and a demodulator--is capable of delivering more than 50 watts peak output at an efficiency exceeding 60 percent, before and after exposure to 3.5 × 1014 n/cm2 (l-MeV equiv.) and 2.0 × 106 rads(Si). The amplifier is immune to catastrophic effects of a pulsed ionizing-radiation environment of short duration through peak dose rates exceeding 1 × 1011 rads(Si)/s. The magnitude of the output response at this level is less than 9 percent of the maximum output voltage, and recovery from transient ionization takes place within one cycle of the amplifier's 3-db cutoff frequency."
"The requirement for radiation hardened registers has been identified for use with existing digital equipment to assure system survivability in nuclear radiation environments. The major problem has been that all semiconductor registers cannot be guaranteed to maintain their information after ionizing radiation transients above 5×109 rads (Si)/sec. Two approaches are shown for designing microelectronic register circuits for increased transient immunity based on the use of temporary storage media: a magnetic circuit and a capacitor circuit. The operation of the circuits are described as well as the features which impart hardness to them. They are compatible with +5V, IC families of saturated logic and are proposed for use with these circuits for specific function hardening. The results of transient tests show the magnetic circuit to work through 107 rads(Si)/sec to 8 × 1010 rads(Si)/sec. The capacitor circuit tests went up as high as 5 × 1010 rads (Si)/sec. Laboratory simulation on the capacitor circuit (using shunting transistors to approximate the effect of the circuit's transistors storage times caused by radiation) indicates hardness to levels in excess of 5 x 1011 rads(Si)/sec."
  "The problem of radiation hardening of metal-oxidesemiconductor (MOS) systems is discussed from a circuit viewpoint. An inverter chain is studied, and its performance in radiation is related to device quality. Techniques for testing and hardening circuits are given."
"A series of experiments was performed to study the effects of acceptor-type, carrier-concentration, and material-growth techniques on the short-term annealing of neutron damage to p-type silicon. No significant dependence of the annealing on these parameters was observed. The parameter most important to the annealing rate is the injected minority-carrier concentration (Δn). The use of extremely low injection concentrations, a very short neutron burst, and early time measurements has resulted in the detection of anneal factors as high as 50 in the tests reported here. No anneal factors of this magnitude have ever been reported before."
"In contrast to n-type material, short-term annealing of neutron-induced lifetime damage in p-type silicon is strongly dependent upon minority carrier density. While physical reordering is an important process, and may be somewhat dependent upon excess electron density in p-type material, arguments presented here indicate that this difference between n- and p-type material is primarily an electronic effect having to do with neutralization of metastable charge states induced during defect production. A qualitative model is presented which appears to be more consistent with experimental observations than those which depend upon physical defect motion alone."
"A model is presented for the short-term annealing of a damage claster resulting from neutron radiation in p-type silicon. The damage cluster is assumed to be a disordered core imbedded in an otherwise undisturbed lattice, as suggested by Gossick. The disordered core is characterized in this model by two defects. The dominant defect immediately after the damaging event is assumed to be the vacancy, which is represented by a two-level defect (donor-acceptor) in the forbidden gap. The density of this defect decreases with time as a function of the densities of its different charge states. The second defect is the divacancy which is also represented by a two-level defect in the forbidden gap. The density of the divacancies increases as the vacancies anneal. The analysis is made for a single, spherically symmetric cluster located at the center of a sphere of radius R of undamaged material. The problem is solved by the PN code which approximates the exact continuity, Poisson's, and generation-recombination equations in finite difference form. Annealing factors are obtained as a function of time by simulating a steady, uniform ionization rate throughout the sphere R. An effective lifetime for the volume R is calculated as the instantaneous average density of excess minority carriers in the sphere divided by the ionization rate. Time histories of the annealing factors are compared to experimental data obtained from shortcircuited solar cells."
"Studies of short-term annealing of minority carrier lifetime in bulk p-type silicon following ~1.4 MeV pulsed electron irradiation are reported. Investigations were performed on vacuum-float-zone boron-doped material in the temperature range 235-3860K and the maximum fluence employed was ~5 x 1012 electrons/cm . Simple exponential recovery under isothermal conditions, a characteristic of first order reaction kinetics, was observed. The amount of unstable damage varied as exp (-t/τR), where τR is the characteristic recovery time. The temperature dependence of τR yielded an activation energy of 0. 32 ± 0. 03 eV for the recovery process. The current results, when extrapolated to lower temperatures, compare quite closely with Watkins' EPR data for similar material. It is concluded that the present data is consistent with the observation of neutral vacancy annealing."
"Minority-carrier lifetime and electrical conductivity measurements were used to observe short-term anneal of the primary electrically active defects produced in high-resistivity n-type silicon by 4.5-, μsec 30-MeV electron pulses. These parameters were monitored from approximately 10 msec to 10 minutes following the electron pulse. Conductivity anneal experiments were conducted over a temperature range of 200° to 340°K, and lifetime experiments from 273° to 340°K. A transient forward anneal (recovery) of minority-carrier lifetime was observed for n-type silicon over this temperature range. This material exhibited a reverse (damge growth) conductivity anneal following a 30-MeV electron pulse. The growth in carrier removal sites with time is attributed to the diffusion of isolated vacancies to form the vacancy-phosphorus complex. The dependence of the anneal time constant and initial carrier removal rate on the Fermi level position suggests that the Ȱ level of the isolated vacancy is above the center of the forbidden gap at approximately 0.39 eV below the conduction band edge"
"The annealing behavior and the uniaxial stress response of radiation-induced defects in Si causing the 1.8-, 3.3-, and 3.9- µ infrared absorption bands, and the EC-0.39 and Ec-0.54eV photoconductivity levels were studied after 1.5 and 45MeV electron and fast neutron irradiation. In addition, photoconductivity associated with the 0.32eV (3.9µ) band is reported. Correlating all of the above results with those obtained previously in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies leads to the conclusion that the defect responsible is the divacancy, i. e., one in which two adjacent Si atoms are knocked out of the lattice to form the intrinsic divacancy defect. The predictions of the divacancy model of Watkins and Corbett(l) is found to give good agreement with the experimental results, in particular as the results are correlated on a microscopic scale with EPR measurements."
"It is demonstrated that a spherical defect cluster is not adequate to explain the doping dependence of carrier removal in neutron damaged silicon. To resolve this problem, a cylindrical cluster of the type calculated by Van Lint et al is examined. This type of cluster can be described as a \"supercluster\" composed of several subclusters of extremely high defect concentration (1021 cm-3) of lower concentration (1018cm-3). The subclusters arise from the final stopping of the recoil atoms. Subclusters are less than 60 Å in diameter and contain up to 100 individual defects. The tree of defects arises from displacements occurring along the tracks of the recoiling lattice atoms. From a consideration of the distribution of space charge and electric potential associated with this type of structure quantitative predictions are made of the doping dependence of carrier removal. These predictions depend un the cluster dimensions and the Fermi energy within the cluster. Since the cluster dimensions can be obtained from the work of Van Lint et al, the predictions depend on only one undetermined parameter. Excellent fit has been obtained between this theory and published data on carrier removal. The indicated values of the Fermi energy within the cluster were 0.48, 0.38, 0.51 eV for N-type float zone, N-type Czochralski, and P-type silicon respectively. These values are not inconsistent with an assignment based on known energy levels of the divacancy and the A-center."
"The results of these measurements are applicable to the design of lithium-containing solar cells. Data concerning the speed and stability of recovery from irradiation damage is presented, including the dependence of these parameters on the lithium and oxygen concentration of the silicon. Floatzone-refined silicon doped with lithium to a concentration ≦ 5 x 1014cm-3 exhibits post-irradiation damage properties similar to those measured on quartz-crucible (Q.C.) silicon doped with lithium from 1015 to 1016cm-3. The speed of recovery from damage (e.g., the mobility) is several hundred times faster in oxygen-lean float-zone-refined silicon than in oxygen-rich quartz-crucible-grown silicon. Two mechanisms of annealing, namely by neutralization and by dissociation of carrier-removal centers were observed in these experiments. Both mechanisms of annealing take place in float-zone (F.Z.) silicon doped with lithium from 4 x 1015 to 1016cm-3, but only the mechanism of neutralization is observed in samples of float-zone silicon doped with lithium concentrations ≦ 5 x 1014cm-3. In contrast to this behavior, only the mechanism of neutralization is observed in quartz-crucible silicon doped with lithium from 1015 to 1016cm-3. A continuous decrease in carrier density is observed to occur for periods ranging from five months to 18 months in irradiated-float-zone silicon with lithium concentrations ≦ 5 x 1014cm-3, and in quartz-crucible silicon with lithium concentrations from 1015 to 1016cm-3, respectively. This mechanism produces uncharged complexes of lithium. A defect located at an energy of ≈ EC-0.12 eV was measured in irradiated-float-zone silicon doped with lithium concentration ≦ 5 x 1014cm-3."
"In order to utilize ion implantation to the best advantage, lattice damage accompanying the process must be repaired, generally by annealing. Accordingly, optical reflection spectroscopy can be a valuable tool for observing the damage and studying the annealing of the damage. The motivation for understanding the implantation process is based on the fact that this process is not just a laboratory curiosity, but represents a device fabrication process that is superior in some cases to diffusion techniques."
"A method for providing neutron hardness assurance for power transistors based on correlation techniques and the application of a group of screening parameters has been successfully demonstrated. Prediction of power transistor gain and saturation voltage at high currents in neutron environments is complicated because of the combined effects of carrier lifetime degradation and carrier removal in base and collector regions of transistors. Simple base region recombination models are not adequate and a two-region, two-dimensional analytical model describing transistor radiation response at high currents is not yet available. However, statistical techniques can be applied to experimental data obtained on sample devices from a production line to derive equations that correlate device radiation performance with selective nondestructive electrical screening measurements. Hardness assurance of each subsequent part from specific production line is accomplished by applying individual device screening data to the derived equations and evaluating predicted response in accordance with desired performance criteria."
"Predictions of low neutron fluence failure probabilities of silicon power transistors are of particular interest since this device type is among the most vulnerable in systems operating in nuclear environments. The Weibull distribution can be used for this, but so far attempts to do so have not been too successful. This work attempts to use more statistically significant sample sizes and a more ideal neutron environment to study four representative device types, two NPN and two PNP. An important result is the extreme sensitivity of the shape of the Weibull plot to the definition of failure. Three definitions are used: (1) minimum remaining fractional gain, (2) minimum remaining absolute gain, and (3) minimum transit-time-normalized damage constant. The effects of these and of various screens on the resulting Weibull plots are noted and discussed. With few exceptions, the observed failure distributions do not fit a simple Weibull distribution suitable for extrapolation to low failure rates. Screening effects can vary over a broad range from truncation of a Weibull function to linearizing a nonlinear distribution to the point that extrapolation is made possible. The efficacy of any combination of failure criterion and screen to describe neutron-induced gain distribution is limited in applicability to certain ranges of device type and current."
"Four samples of one hundred devices each were tested. Three transistor types, consisting of 200 of type 2N1613, 100 of type 2N2219, and 100 of type 2N3420, were irradiated under various bias conditions in a Co-60 gamma environment at a rate of 7.6 × 103 Rads(Si) /hour and an ambient temperature of 25°C. Data are presented in terms of percent failure versus dose [up to 5.8 × 105 Rads(Si)] for a family of failure criteria and for a family of measurement conditions. It is concluded that 1) the Weibull distribution seems to be adequate as a means of predicting low-dose survival probability if care is taken to fully characterize the one or more distributions present. For the devices studied, there is not a minimum value for darnage threshold; however, in two device types there does appear to be either more than one failure mode present or else two distributions. 2) the Weibull technique can be used to indicate manufacturing variations in device lots and, when combined with parameter frequency charts, may provide a screening technique or a monitor on the quality of semiconductor device surfaces. 3) ionizing radiation may in many cases be the dominant environmental component to consider when projecting component and system reliability since 0.1 percent failure probabilities can occur at doses of the order of 103 rads. 4) operating conditions during irradiation have a significant effect on the reliability of at least the 2N1613 device type."
"A novel method is presented whereby the neutron-induced degradation characteristics of semiconductor components can be predicted, and total assurance of operation can be attained even under severe radiation environments. The method, involving irradiation-annealing cycles is shown to be economical and reliable in the wafer stage, and feasible for packaged off the shelf hardened components. Radiation damage effects on semiconductors are discussed. Defect annealing phenomena is considered under a variety of temperature ambients. Experimental irradiate-anneal data is presented for both discrete transistors and IC dielectrically isolated 709 amplifiers manufactured by three different vendors. The results of a number of tests shows the feasibility of obtaining very accurate prediction of the components' degradation characteristics and as a result suggests the application of this method by the semiconductor vendor in supplying components with known quality assurance and \"guaranteed\" performance under a given neutron fluence."
"Internal visual inspection of integrated circuits (ICs) as now implemented is highly subjective, and the quality of the inspected product is not always satisfactory. As an approach to reducing the subjectivity of visual inspection, optical spatial filtering has been used to produce an IC defect image. The inspector is presented with an IC image in which most of the complex IC pattern detail is suppressed while the image of a defect is enhanced. Results range from excellent for metalization defects on optically smooth circuits to poor for certain low contrast defects on circuits with a high degree of surface roughness."
"Many military electronic systems are required to function during or after exposure to a nuclear radiation environment. Bipolar transistors and related integrated circuits are very sensitive to the effects of neutron damage that decrease transistor current gain and increase transistor saturation resistance. These effects may result in post-irradiation circuit failure at neutron fluences below radiation specification, particularly when ordinary neutron effect screening techniques are used. This paper describes a screening technique that assures postirradiation electrical performance of semiconductor piece parts, eliminates the problem associated with the so-called \"maverick\" or unpredictable transistor, and monitors the effects of manufacturing process changes. This technique is economically attractive when applied on a lot-to-lot basis. Nuclear radiation is an additional environment to be considered in production lot-to-lot semiconductor quality assurance. For any environment, acceptable products are determined by 100 percent screening tests to the specification level (Group A) followed by sample environmental tests (Group B) that measure the level of success of the initial screening procedure. If silicon wafers have been subjected to reactor radiation, Group A and Group B screening techniques can be used to screen semiconductor devices for radiation effects on electrical parameters. This is accomplished by irradiating and thermal annealing the in-process silicon wafers, subjecting them to Group A tests and then subjecting samples to Group B tests. The screening technique has been demonstrated practical and repeatable through use of the White Sands Missile Range Fast Burst Reactor (FBR) and the University of Arizona TRIGA Reactor."
"In some experiments it is of interest to be able to estimate the photon-produced emission current at higher energy and for this purpose we have performed calculations described below. The calculated curves include contributions due to the photoelectric, Compton and Auger effects. A method for estimating the fluorescent contribution is being proposed and the results of calculations are presented."
"Low energy electron emission from several metals exposed to Co60 gamma rays, 10 MeV electrons, and 0.1 to 1.0 KeV electrons has been studied. The experiments described here, together with other reported results, indicate that for a given metal the emission of electrons with energies below 50 eV is proportional to the absorbed dose and is independent of the type and energy of the primary radiation. For the common metals the charge emitted per square centimeter per rad is found to be between 1.0 to 3.0 × 10-13 coulombs. It also appears that the magnitude of the emission induced by high energy radiations can be predicted from the secondary emission yields observed under low energy electron bombardment. Under certain assumptions it is shown that the data is consistent with an internal isotropic low energy electron distribution given by N(E)∝ E-3"
"During irradiation tests on a Czochralski-grown single-crystal sapphire sample, a trapping phenomenon was observed which led to an apparent nonlinear dependence of the radiation-induced conductivity on dose rate. These data have been interpreted in terms of a minimum projected range of the secondary electrons generated by the primary beam. A range of about 1000 Å is calculated."
"A series of tests was conducted in a space environment chamber to determine experimentally the space radiation effects in ZnCdS, CaWO4 and CsI. The scintillating materials were exposed to electron and proton beams of varying energy and flux to determine techniques for reducing space radiation induced light emission to a minimum. The objective was to determine whether scintillating materials could be used in a space-craft to monitor signals from active sources. Electrons were found to contribute to the background light output via secondary X-rays produced in the shielding materials, while protons were found not to have any effect on shielded scintillators. A lead-aluminum sandwich geometry was shown to be the most effective means of shielding scintillating materials."
"The effects of gamma and neutron radiation on coaxial cables should be described as a current due to kinetically moved charge and a conductivity. Simple models, using known cross sections for gamma and neutron interactions can be used to calculate the amount of charge displacement. The radiation-induced conductance of a cable can also be estimated from data on the dielectric material. Experimental data frequently show larger initial response than the estimates. The observed current is proportional to instantaneous dose rate or flux, but the proportionality factor is a generally decreasing function of dose or fluence, even changing signs in some cases. The anomalies suggest relaxation of space charges created in the dielectric by the manufacturing process or by physical motion."
"The effects of electron irradiation on frequency and on internal friction, Q-1, of 5 MHz, 5th overtone, high precision AT-cut quartz resonators are evaluated. The oscillators were irradiated with 10 MeV electrons to a dose of 1 Mrad(Si), transient and permanent frequency shifts monitored, and resonator internal friction measured before and after irradiation in the temperature range of 4.2 to 475°K. This investigation was carried out under nearly identical manufacturing and experimental conditions on resonators fabricated from natural, electronic grade synthetic, lithium carbonate doped, lithium nitrite doped, low impurity content high-Q, and electrolyzed (swept) electronic grade synthetic quartz crystals. The swept synthetic crystal oscillator shows the highest radiation tolerance."
"The power output of ruby lasers is decreased when they are exposed to high energy ionizing radiation. The causes for this degradation are: (1) the absorption of the laser light by a radiation-induced absorption at the lasing wavelength, (2) a change in the valence state of the lasing impurity, Cr3+ ions and (3) the absorption of the flash lamp pump light by radiation induced absorption. By experimentally determining the magnitude of each of these damage parameters, one is able to estimate for a particular absorbed dose the expected laser degradation. The technique for performing this calculation as well as the experimental verification of the prediction are reported."
"The effects of permanent neutron damage on the operation of high efficiency avalanche microwave sources are explained. The resulting design criteria for increasing the neutron radiation tolerance of these devices are verified by comparing experimental results for two different device doping profiles. In terms of RF failure, the device with the narrower space-charge region is more radiation resistant. This is because RF failure is related to recombination of carriers as they transit the space-charge region. A theoretical curve predicting neutron damage failure versus frequency of operation is presented and shown to agree with the experimental data taken from the two different TRAPATT oscillators. The DC failure of the devices takes the form of a negative temperature coefficient at large reverse breakdown currents which is related to carrier removal at the edges of the space-charge region. In terms of this DC failure mechanism the device with the more abrupt doping profile is more radiation tolerant."
"Both pulsed and CW GaAs Gunn oscillator diodes, wit initial carrier concentrations between 3.3 × 1014 cm-3 & 1.5 × 1015 cm-3 were irradiated in a series of steps to total accumlated neutron fluences as high as 1.12 × 1014n · cm-2 (E≥10 keV). A low field I-V point was determined, and the frequency and output power were measured at the operating voltage for each device. Carrier removal rates were determined from the low-field resistance. Values ranged betwreen 3.57 cm-1 and 10.3 cm-1 for these devices and were found to vary as the 0.4 power of the initial carrier concentration. Output power ultimately decreased with increasing fluence, with device failure occurring between 2.4 × 1013 n · cm-2 and about 1 × 1014n · cm-2 , increasing fairly linearly with the initial carrier concentration. The carrier concentration at device failure also depends linearly on the initial concentration."
"To correlate the performance of Gunn diodes in a radiation environment with the radiation-induced defects in the active epitaxial layer of the device, radiation effects on Gunn diodes and Hall bars grown simultaneously were investigated. This paper will assess the results that indicate that neutron-induced degradation in device efficiency is due to carrier removal, reduction of the peak-to valley-current ratio by low-field mobility degradation, and slow trapping of high-field conduction electrons."
"The effect of electron irradiation on different types of commercially available light emitting diodes has been investigated. The following phenomena were studied as a function of electron fluences up to 1015 e/cm2: changes in light intensity vs. voltage and current voltage characteristics, lens darkening and surface effects. The following materials were investigated in order of increasing radiation resistance: epitaxial GaAs, diffused GaAs, GaP, GaAsl-xPx and SiC. Two types of pulsed GaAs laser diodes and a continuously operated YAG:Nd laser rod were also irradiated. The two most sensitive devices, epitaxial GaAs light emitting diodes and YAG:Nd lasers, showed significant losses in light output at fluences below 1012e/cm2"
"Capacitance-voltage curves and low temperature capacitance-recovery techniques are used to determine the defect generation rate and energy levels in the depletion region of surface barrier radiation detectors (Schottky diodes) irradiated with low energy(.2 - .4MeV) protons. The damage rate is about 1.3 × 10-2; net donor defects per proton, independent of energy. Most of the damage is created close to the end of the proton range. After room temperature stabilization energy levels were found at Ec - 0.24, Ev + .26, Ev + .32, and Ec - .47. The capture cross sections suggest that the second and fourth levels are donors and the third an acceptor. The fourth is the major level. Most of the damage anneals in the 100°C to 200°C range. These properties do not correlate well with the properties of the divacancy, a defect prominent in neutron irradiated silicon. The annealing behavior, on the other hand, suggest that the major defect is the Si P-3 defect."
"The effect of low-energy (<2 MeV) proton irradiation upon the junction properties of silicon solar cells has been measured. These measurements are used to explain the large power loss observed on the ATS-1 and Intelsat II-4 satellites."
"Neutron damage centers in the depletion region between the gates and channel of a JFET fluctuate in charge and modulate the drain current. Thus, they create noise. The noise from 1012 14.8 MeV neutrons/cm2 is easily measured. Temperature dependence of leakage current indicates a neutron damage generation-recombination level effective at about Ec - 0.5 eV. The noise spectral distribution cannot be adequately characterized by a two state trap with single characteristic lifetimes for the two states."
 "A technique, based on a variation of kinetic spectroscopy, is presented to measure radiation dose and dose rate from pulsed sources. The hydrated electron, produced by ionizing radiation in aqueous media, has an optical absorption in the visible region of the spectrum. This absorption is used to follow the radiation pulse. This method has the intrinsic advantages of extremely high speed, low cost, and minimal calibration. A chemical system is described that will allow the dose and dose rate monitoring cell to be used repeatedly. The method described covers the range from 100 rad to 10 krad at dose rates as high as 2 x 1012 rad s-1. Radiation pulses as short as 5ns have been resolved."
"The energy depos ited at various depths in aluminum by incident monoenergetic electrons has been measured with a silicon-semiconductor, transmission detector. Beams of monoenergetic electrons with incident energies of 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 MeV were directed normally on a semi-infinite slab of aluminum in which a 0.196-mm silicon detector was positioned at various depths. The pulse-height distributions recorded with the detector were converted to absorbed-energy distributions from which the probability of energy absorption per incident electron in the specific layer, as well as the absorbed energy as a function of depth in the material, could be determined. The curves of absorbed energy as a function of depth obtained for aluminum at each energy were compared to those calculated by Berger and Seltzer, employing a Monte Carlo method. Good agreement is shown between calculations and measurements."
"The deposition profiles for the pulsed electron beams in solid radiation sensitive plastics have been measured and indicate a pronounced range shortening at charge fluences greater than 0.5 microcoulombs/cm2. This range shortening, due to charge trapping and the attendant internal field, reaches a constant value in the absence of apparent breakdown which is independent of charge fluence at current densities greater than about 33 amps/cm2 for mean electron energies of 1.35 MeV. The dose depth profiles at charge fluences greater than 0.5 microcoulomb/ cm2 exhibit a linearly decreasing back edge which extrapolates to approximately 35% of the low fluence range and a low intensity tail extending to greater than 55% of this range. As the charge fluence increases, the tail of the dose profile decreased in relation to the forward portion. These phenomena are interpreted in terms of a charge deposition model including radiation induced conductivity."
"A review of some diagnostic techniques and instrumentation used at Sandia Laboratories for studying intense electron beams and laboratory pulsed x-ray sources is presented. Included are descriptions of current monitors, radiation sensitive polymer films, and calorimeter arrays for beam energy density measurements. Also discussed is the real time-on line digital computer used for calorimetry measurements. A new technique for measuring electron energy as a function of time is presented and representative data from Sandia's Hermes-II facility are shown. These data are in turn used with a Monte Carlo code to determine the brems-strahlung spectrum, which is compared with a direct photon measurement made with a large Compton spectrometer. Finally, a discussion is given of the use of these data in radiation effects experimentation. The results of combined photon-electron transport calculations are shown which demonstrate the edge and interface effects which are important for thin and inhomogeneous samples."
 "Calculations have been made of the number and energy spectrum of primary electrons generated in silicon and germanium volumes by incident gamma photons of energy 300 kcV to 3 Mev. Direct calculations were used for small silicon samples, and Monte Carlo methods for larger germanium samples where multiple gamma scattering wqas significant. Primary electron populations generated within silicon by the same exposure dose from cesium-137, cobalt-60, sodium-24 and fission gamma sources are compared. The simulation of primary electron spectra generated within the sample, rather than the incident gamma spectrum is considered as an applied radiation effects technique. The multiple scattering calculations show that as sample volume increases, the density of ionization increases for a fixed gamma exposure, and that the flux of electrons with sufficient energy to cause displacements decreases for a fixed absorbed gamma energy dose."
"Energy deposition profiles in aluminum and gold adjacent to materials of different atomic number were measured with a multiple parallel plate ionization chamber. The results show that significant variations in dose distributions occur at high photon energies where the mass energy absorption coefficients differ relatively little from one material to another. At these energies (e.g., 1.25 MeV) the perturbation in the bulk dose is no longer a simple function of atomic number alone. The enhancement or reduction in dose becomes very sensitive to the direction of the incident photon beam. The energy deposited in a material is enhanced when it is next to one of lower atomic number provided the gamma beam penetrates the lower atomic number material first. A reversal in bean direction reduces the dose to a level below what it would be for either material alone."
"The current dependence of the neutron damage factor for transistor beta degradation was correlated with the carrier transit time across both the emitter-base junction and the base region of a transistor. An electrical measurement related to this transit time was used to generate current-independent damage factors for 100 devices of 16 types. The use of the junction delay in addition to the base transit time was based on recent work which indicated the importance of this region in transistor beta degradation. From this work it appears that a graphical method can be used to separate the components of damage occuring in the base and in the emitter-base depletion region. Because the damage factor is independent of current, a single value can be determined for a given transistor type and used as a figure-of-merit for hardness assurance when divided by the gain-bandwidth product, fT, of the transistor at the operating current. This new damage \"constant\" should be more effective than the present damage factor in hardness assurance screens because its coefficient of variation is smaller at low currents."
"A discrete, deterministic mathematical model has been developed for the bulk base region of graded base devices that accounts for both the effects of neutron-induced recombination and built-in electric field in the base region at low, intermediate, and moderate current/injection levels. Exact expressions are developed for the bulk base recombination current and the collector current as functions of neutron fluence. EBact expressions are derived for the base recombination term and the relative rates of neutroninduced base current increase and collector current decrease. These expressions involve exponential and hyperbolic functions and are well suited for numerical computations and theoretical analysis. Damage cpefficients for the bulk base recombination current and for the collector current are computed theoretically and are experimentally verified."
"A hybrid recombination model has been formulated for neutron irradiated silicon which correctly predicts the minority carrier recombination in both the neutral and space charge regions of a device. Exact, one-dimensional, numerical calculations have been performed using this model and compared to reported V-I characteristics of irradiated p+ n diodes. The calculated curves agree with the reported data within 20% over the seven decade span of currents in the investigations, for diode base resistivities from 0.25 Ω-cm to 17 Ω-cm. At low injection levels the calculated recombination occurs predominantly in the junction space charge region, whereas at high injection both the space charge region and neutral region can be important. Calculations have also been performed for the recombination occurring throughout a typical NPN silicon transistor. The results indicate that space charge region recombination is probably dominant in modern, narrow base transistors even at high injection levels."
"Lithium niobate is being considered for use as the active element in piezoelectric transducers in a nuclear reactor. For tests in a simulation of this environment, a Y-cut disk of this material 1 cm in diameter and 0.1 cm thick was mounted in a holder designed to allow measurement of piezoelectric properties of the materials, and was exposed to 4 X 109 R of 60Co gamma rays at elevated temperatures in air. Exposure was at a dose rate of 1.75 X 107 R/h with approximately one half of the dose accumulated at 281°C and half at 537°C. The piezoelectric properties showed no changes that would affect the usefulness of the material for the intended purpose."
"A model has been developed describing the space-charge region of silicon p+n junctions in the presence of deep traps. These traps are assumed to be defects with discrete energy levels in the forbidden energy gap. This model is applied to high frequency (1 MHz) capacitance-voltage measurements of two neutron-irradiated silicon p+n junctions where Nd = 5 X 1014 cm-3 and 1015 cm-3. It was found that two acceptor traps at Ec-0.4 eV and Ec-0.58 eV adequately fit the data. Since the divacancy has similar levels, the divacancy is a logical defect to assign to these levels. In addition, it was found that the defect introduction rate was 0.95 cm-1 for one of the junctions (Nd = 5 X 1014 cm-3), fabricated in bulk material; whereas, for the other junction (Nd = 5 X 1014 cm-3), fabricated in epitaxial material, the defect introduction rate was 0.64 cm-1. These rates are consistent with those reported previously in the literature."
"The rapid annealing behavior of silicon NPN transistors irradiated with fission neutrons at the Sandia Pulsed Reactor (SPR-II) was investigated in this work. The annealing which normally occurs in the unobservable period during and shortly after the~50 μs wide neutron burst has been shown to be considerably reduced by removing bias to the device during the burst (current \"circumvention\"). Room temperature annealing factors greater than three were observed for nearly all devices when bias was reapplied after the burst, even for high collector currents and after considerable circumvention times. These annealing factors were considerably larger than ones measured using comparable dc injection levels, indicating that a substantially greater portion of the recovery was observed using current circumvention. By following a greater portion of the recovery, very little difference was observed between annealing rates at 132°K and 300°K when annealing curves were normalized to unity total change. An activation energy of less than .02eV was obtained by comparing the times for 50 percent annealing to occur at different temperatures. This value is significantly less than ~.3eV activation energy obtained in previous studies. The circumvention technique also allowed a quantitative method for measuring the injection dependence of rapid annealing. The results for the 2N1613 indicated widely different annealing factors were joined into a single annealing curve when plotted as a function of injection charge (time-integrated current). A charge injection between one and ten microcoulomb was sufficient to reduce AF to two for nearly all the devices and device types examined."
"Although the subject of shielding by means of ferromagnetic materials has been investigated for almost four centuries, 1 it is not as well understood as the subject of shielding by means of nonferromagnetic materials. Many publications have dealt with magnetic shielding in both steady and time varying situations. Most of these papers are concerned with the calculations of shielding effectiveness for various configurations. To facilitate the computations, the permeability of the material is usually assumed to be a constant because without the aid of powerful digital computers the calculations would be impossible. In many cases the permeability chosen to represent the material is adjusted to make the calculations agree with experiment. Hence, in the past nearly all magnetic shielding problems have been treated as nonmagnetic shielding problems with the material permeability chosen greater than unity."
"In many circuit applications, semiconductor junctions will be highly ionized when EMP induced voltage and current surges are applied to device terminals. This report presents results from a series of experiments which were performed to investigate the effect of high ionization rates (5 × 1011 rads (Si)/sec) on the pulsed current failure level of a bipolar transistor. Exposure of the devices to simultaneous EMP and ionization environments showed that the forward biased base emitter junction damage threshold was significantly lowered."
"Semiconductor devices operating under both biased and unbiased conditions are vulnerable to permanent damage from relatively moderate levels of pulsed electrical energy, particularly of submicrosecond pulse duration. An experimental study was performed to determine the permanent damage levels associated with a number of different devices and to identify the failure mechanisms associated with each. The device types investigated included general purpose and high speed computer diodes, a medium power diode, medium frequency and UHF transistor amplifiers, and a dielectrically isolated diode gate expander. The permanent damage levels associated with these devices were determined both for positive and negative polarity pulses at different conditions of quiescent bias and pulse width. The pulse duration times included the range of 30 to 300 nanoseconds, and in some instances, up to 1 microsecond. Failure models for both thermal second breakdown induced damage to the semiconductor junction and thermal damage to the device interconnecting leads and metallization patterns were also developed."
"Recent laboratory experiments indicate that cermet thin-film resistors consisting of an 80/20 mixture of chromium and silicon monoxide can be fabricated to high sheet resistances up to 4500 ohms per square. These films show a pronounced thermal stability of <1 ppm/°C from -50°C to +175°C. Radiation stability of the films is ≤1% variance in absolute resistance for fluences up to 1 × 1015 e/cm2 at a 1.5 MeV energy level."
"This investigation has characterized the effects of fast neutron bombardment on a typical n-p-n transistor (2N914) of a common emitter amplifier operating at high-frequencies (>100 MHz) by means of s-parameter measurements from 120 MHz to 350 MHz, inclusive, every 10 MHz. The changes in the four (4) s-parameters and the trends and consequences of neutron bombardment are examined pictorially on graphs. The general effect of fast neutron bombardment is to decrease the magnitude of each s-parameter for frequencies below z · fT (where z = (Ф/1013)0.1). However, if the device is operating above z · fT, the magnitudes of s11 (input reflection coefficient) and s21 (forward insertion gain, which may be approximated by hfe) increased above the pre-irradiation values, which would not be expected from previous work carried out at d-c and low frequencies."

"The basic characteristics contributing to the nonlinear time-varying gluco-corticoid control mechanism in 300-gram male rats fasted 18 hours have been formulated. Intact animal time responses of the plasma levels of corticosterone to intraperitoneally injected doses of 50, 200, and 500 μg/kg simulated on an analog computer were compared with the experimental results. Nonlinear time-dependent characteristics of the hypothalamic-hypophyseal complex, previously unobtainable experimentally, were arrived at indirectly through the use of experimental data and simple control theory analysis. Involved compartmental analysis of the complex kinetics for the intraperitoneally injected dose was bypassed by using experimental data and concepts of control mechanisms. The model was found to be compatible with the linear model of Yates."
"Pulse trains with sinusoidally modulated pulse frequencies (50 to 150 pps) were used to stimulate the abducens nerve of the anesthetized cat. Eye movements, the measured output of the system, were observed to follow the sinusoidal modulating waveform over the modulation frequency range of 0.5 to 25 Hz. The gain and phase characteristics of such eye movements indicated the presence of a first-order system at the end of the oculomotor pathway. A delay between stimulation and eye movement of approximately 12 ms was indicated by the frequency response as well as by the step response of the system."
"An objective method was developed to measure the time course of torsional eye movements about the line of sight. The resolution of the system was better than ½°."
"The physiological significance of the node of Ranvier is now well known. The histological delineation of its length, however, still remains uncertain. Should it be identified as the gap between the myelin sheaths, or the whole part of the narrowed axon? The present analysis, which makes use of the transmission-line theory, shows that both the length and the diameter of the node are definitely related to the fiber diameter, even though these relations are not linear ones. Theoretical curves are constructed, which are expected to fit with the histological measurements pertaining to the effective structure of the node."
"The stability of legged machines in locomotion is considered. The general machine has a rigid body to which legs are attached. Locomotion is performed on level smooth surfaces."
"A method is proposed in which the diagnostic evaluation of medical data is accomplished on the basis of a series of decision tables. The decision table is laid out consisting of rules, each specifying conditions which must be satisfied for a given diagnostic category. For example, a rule may read: ``If the QRS duration in any two limb leads is greater than or equal to 0.12 second, and if the PR interval in any two limb leads is greater than 0.12 second, and if intrinsicoid deflection onset in V1 or V2 is greater than or equal to 0.06 second, then right bundle branch block should be diagnosed.'' Decision tables can be very easily translated into FORTRAN language and used for the computer-aided evaluation of medical data."
"Ventricular-programmed pacemakers are designed to avoid the possibility of dangerous or lethal arrhythmias provoked by stimulation during the vulnerable phase of the ventricle. Even so, rapid heart action (tachyarrhythmia) may still occur. Illustrative examples are presented in which tachyarrhythmia is presumed to have occurred or in which the vulnerable phase has been stimulated, because of: 1)inferior electrode placement, 2) the interaction of a unit with certain characteristics and spontaneous premature beats, 3)a long Q-T interval and late vulnerable phase, 4)failure to pace at adequate rates, and 5)an unusual ``coupled'' extrasystolic arrhythmia."
"The electrical activity of a dog's heart is modeled as originating in ten regions, called zones, each of which is either completely active or completely inactive at any one time. Using this model, the electrical activation sequence of the dog's heart during QRS is computed from potentials measured on the dog's torso, and from his geometry. The sequence computed is compared with measurements directly from the dog's heart. Additionally, the sequence is recomputed with perturbations in the location of the heart within the torso and with noise added to the torso potential data to see how greatly these changes affect the solution. The results support the possibility of using an ON-OFF model to determine the electrical activity of the heart."
"This study reports on the errors in the calculation of a heart dipole introduced by deleting individual electrode contributions to a surface potential map. The potential at 150 points on each of 6 normal children was available at several instants of the QRS cycle. Although it was impossible to test all possible sets of deleted points, or all possible methods of compensatory weighting of the residual points, the results indicate that a number of electrodes at least as great as 100 is required to produce consistent relative errors of less than 15 percent, if surface potential integration is employed in determining the heart's total dipole moment."
"Radioactive phosphorus 32P has been used extensively in the assessment of cellular activity.

"A design for an electronic filter with a transfer function inverse to that of the middle ear of the cat is given. The filter predistorts electrical input signals to an earphone driver amplifier in order to counteract the inherent low-pass operation of the middle ear. Thus, the effective bandwidth at the output of the middle ear is increased from approximately 1700 Hz to approximately 10 000 Hz, thereby permitting a new degree of stimulus control."
"Two different definitions of the common-mode rejection ratio for differential amplifiers are not clearly distinguished. These ratios may differ by orders of magnitude. When differential amplifiers are used to minimize common mode interference in bioelectric measurements, these two ratios should be carefully defined and their magnitudes determined experimentally."
"A simple stimulator has been devised in which sinusoidal signals in the audio range are linearly modulated to generate tone bursts of controlled duration and shape for auditory research. The stimulator comprises a transistor differential pair modulator whose differential collector voltage is the product of the voltage applied at a base (sine wave input) and the emitter current (varied by the modulating waveform). A trapezoidal generator is provided for the modulating waveform. The output is greater than 60 dB above noise and switching transients and the ON-OFF ratio is greater than 60 dB up to 50 kHz. The frequency response is flat to 50 kHz, and there is no appreciable distortion. The trapezoidal generator has equal rise and fall times which are independent of the flat-top duration."

"The design of low-cost devices, which will sense and encode a printed page in such a way that the unfamiliar output can be learned, perceived, and readily understood by a blind person, poses fundamental questions about the information processing capabilities of the human brain for which there are at present no clear answers. To circumvent these difficulties at the sacrifice of low cost, machines-synthesized speech has been adopted, and a number of reading machines employing this output have been planned and are in the process of being built. Nevertheless, despite the fact that many of the fundamental coding problems will be avoided by this procedure, it must be recognized that the sighted reader achieves high reading speeds and good comprehension by means of a complex scanning strategy, and that to realize the fullest advantages of the speech medium, the blind reader will have to be capable of exercising flexible motor control over the output of his reading machine."
"The elastic stiffness coefficients of dried bovine phalanx and femur and of fresh bovine phalanx were measured by an ultrasonic technique. An analysis of the electrical behavior and the crystallographic and morphological character of bone showed that it is a texture which has the same form of the elastic coefficient matrix as a hexagonal single crystal. The five elastic stiffness coefficients of fresh phalanx are: C11 = 1.97, C12 = 1.21, C13 = 1.26, C33 = 3.20, shear moduli as a function of direction were calculated."
"The technique of analytical photogrammetry has been applied to the problem of precisely specifying some of the spatial features of the growing mouse. In particular, the surface area and volume have been determined, and contour maps prepared. It is shown that the variations in weight, surface area, and volume are well represented by third-order polynomials."
"An inductive conductivity meter is described, especially adapted as a salinity monitor for dialysis water. Salinity are given. The principal problems of the inductive conductivity meter result from the low conductivity of electrolytes. The weak coupling due to the electrolyte means that stray coupling must be reduced to a very low level. This has been accomplished by means of a heavy copper eddy-current shield, which reduces the unwanted coupling to a level corresponding to a conductivity increment of the order of 10-8 Ω-1. cm-1. The effect of parasitic impedances in the receiver core are minimized by designing this core as a current transformer, rather than a voltage transformer. The operating frequency is 5600 Hz. The circuits are described, including the oscillator, current-sensitive preamplifier, phase-sensitive detector, dc amplifiers, and alarm circuits. The phase-sensitive detector uses ordinary planar transistors and does not require a square wave reference signal."
"Internal fluorochromes and chromophores afford the possibility of a continuous, nondestructive readout of biochemical information from complex systems such as intact organs. An instrument has been constructed which allows simultaneous observation of fluorescence emission from reduced pyridine nucleotides [NAD(P)H] and certain oxidized flavoproteins together with dual wavelength absorption measurements of cytochrome b. The instrument is applied to a preparation of perfused frog heart. The kinetic responses of the three parameters to oxygen, nitrogen, and 2-mM amytal are observed. Flavoprotein and cytochrome b show a delayed reduction in response to a transition from O2 to N2.NAD(P)H shows an early small reduction which can be attributed to the interaction of a cytoplasmic pool with oxidases located in peroxisomes and the endoplasmic reticulum. Addition of amytal to the oxygenated perfusate produces a small additional oxidation of cytochrome b."
"The results of calculations which use diffusion equations for photons to calculate optical transmission and backscattering by whole blood will be compared with a variety of published data. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the usefulness of the diffusion theory approach to the optics of blood and to present information concerning the dependence of the scattering and absorption parameters for blood on the pertinent variables such as hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, and optical wavelength."
"Light is absorbed and scattered by whole blood. At very low hematocrit values scattering is small, but for hematocrit ≧0.05 light patterns in blood indicate that scattered photons obey the diffusion equations. Diffusion theory predicts the circular light patterns observed in normal whole blood. Transmittance measurements by small fiberoptic probes in a blood medium give data which are in good agreement with diffusion theory. Values of the diffusion penetration depth δd are obtained from the data, which give a quantitative measure of light penetration into blood."
"This paper describes a new method for selective cerebral catheterization based on the Pod catheter [6], [7], guided and propelled by means of external magnetic fields. The principles of the Pod catheter, and the necessary equipment are described, and conclusions are drawn from experiments with a glass model. The middle cerebral artery was catheterized selectively, and cytotoxic material was injected into it to treat a malignant tumor of the brain hemisphere."
"A mathematical model was used to investigate the effects of electrical inhomogeneities introduced by the intracavitary blood mass and the lungs on the apparent location and magnitude of a current dipole source representing local activity in the myocardium. Radial and tangential current source moments were considered, and lung conductivity was taken as a variable parameter. Both the blood mass and the lungs cause a current source to appear closer to the heart center than it actually is. The effect increases as the source moves away from the endocardial surface, and maximum displacement is estimated to be of the order of 1 cm. The net effect of the inhomogeneities is to increase the magnitude of the radial component of a source dipole while diminishing its tangential component. These effects depend on source location."
"An on-line real-time spike recognition and separation system for up to six different spikes in multiple unit extracellular records has been developed using the Micro-LINC 300 computer. Assuming biphasic potentials, the computer extracts four unambiguous variables, two in amplitude and two in time. One variable of a selected pair is plotted against the other on the computer CRT. Points representing the same class of signal will fall into clusters. Cluster boundaries for spike separation are set visually by the investigator. Output is in the form of pulses on different relay lines. The system permits waveforms to overlap up to 15 percent. Examples of system performance with real signals are presented. A comparison is made with other spike recognition systems. A simple system is presented for generating artificial test signals and a technique described for testing any spike recognition system."
"A multiplexing, demodulating, and recording telemetry system designed to process multiple pulse-coded temperature channels is described. The system provides complete control of recording and multiplexing sequences and timing, and gives a single analog signal in response to each sample of pulse-coded data. It identifies all channels and indicates to a computer when a new data sample is to be processed. The system is self-calibrating to maintain accuracy over extended data collection periods, and is inexpensive."
"The employment of a read-only memory store as a storage medium for limited speech vocabularies is described.

 "This paper discusses the transparency of the normal mammalian cornea with particular reference to the scattering of light from the fibril structure in the stroma. It is shown theoretically that Maurice's fibril-lattice model would allow about 50Å rms isotropic fibril displacements from the ideal lattice positions to produce one percent scatter. This theoretically acceptable disorder seems to be in reasonable agreement with electron micrographic investigations. It is also shown that the scattered power is inversely proportional to the fifth power of the wavelength for this scattering model. Other scattering models are also discussed. These exhibit different wavelength dependence (1/λ3, 1/λ). Unfortunately no scatter versus wavelength measurements seem to have been reported in the literature."
"The transthoracic mutual-impedance responses to lung ventilation were measured for 37 normal subjects with 14 orthogonal lead systems. Spatial intravariability resulted from small errors in electrode placement on the thoracic surface. Temporal intravariability was determined by repeating the measurements for one subject on five consecutive days. Insignificant correlation coefficients were obtained between impedance sensitivity to lung ventilation and either age, height, weight, or chest-to-back distance of the subject. Intra-and intersubject variability were found to be of the same size for a given lead system. While the significant spatial intervariability can be easily correlated with local resistance changes due to lung volume shifts, the intersubject variability did not lend itself to correlation with subject somatotype variables."
"Flow birefringence is a convenient and useful technique for studying the initiation and propagation of fluid disturbances in transparent models of the cardiovascular system. Prior quantitative work has been restricted to analysis of two-dimensional systems using shallow channels. The theory of flow birefringence is discussed and a technique for analysis of three-dimensional models is proposed."
"A pressure transducer utilizing an electrooptical method is described. As the transducer is primarily intended for intravascular use, it has been given the form of a catheter with the pressure-sensing part at the one end and the necessary bulky components at the other end. A light guide of glass fibers inside the catheter transports light from a light source to the measuring tip. Here the pressure variations affect a movable membrane which reflects a variable amount of light into another light guide leading to a photodetector. The variations in the signal from the detector are thus proportional to the applied pressure. The main part of the paper is concerned with a theoretical investigation of the principle for transducers of this type. This analysis gives relationships between the geometry of the measuring tip, the number of glass fibers, and their distribution, material constants, and signal parameters. Using these relations, it is possible to arrive at the fundamental limitations of the method, particularly in regard to the miniaturization. Furthermore, some temperature effects which are generally neglected, are analyzed."
"A mathematical model for thermal-chemical damage to biological materials excited by laser irradiation is described. The chemical rate equations for protein denaturization are used to predict radii of damage for cases where the input-laser-energy distribution results in the uniform heating of a small sphere or a disk. These rate equations are limited to a single-hit process. Experimental checks on this model are presented for ruby-laser irradiation of small carbon particles in egg albumin and for CO2-laser surface heating of egg albumin."
"Instrumentation is described which permits, along with simultaneous subjective observation, the rapid recording and quantification of the overt behavior of motile microorganisms under varying conditions. From a chain of standard commercially available units (with the exception of a single especially designed one) there has emerged a totality which provides unique advantages to the student of overt behavior. It consists of a primary optical system through which the organisms are televised, a standard video tape recorder, a unit which we have christened the ``bugwatcher'' that processes the video signal from the tape for quantification of data by a computer, and finally, a digital computer."
"This paper describes a new multielectrode microprobe which utilizes integrated-circuit fabrication techniques to overcome many of the problems associated with conventional microelectrodes. The probe structure consists of an array of gold electrodes which are supported on a silicon carrier and which project beyond the carrier for a distance of about 50 μ to allow a close approach to active neurons. These electrodes are covered with a thin (0.4-μ) layer of silicon dioxide which is selectively removed at the electrode tips using high-resolution photoengraving techniques to define the recording areas precisely. The processing sequence described permits any two-dimensional electrode array to be realized. Interelectrode spacings can be accurately controlled in the range from 10 to 20 μ or larger, and electrode-tip diameters can be as small as 2 μ."
"An electronic neural analog is described which contains variable absolute and relative refractory periods, two time constants, and separate control of the ``accommodation'' to sub-threshold voltage changes and the ``adaptation'' produced by the occurrence of output pulses (spikes). The extensive use of integrated-circuit operational amplifiers permits an accurate description of input-output relationships over a wide range of values for all parameters. This facilitates comparison of the results obtained both with neural data and mathematical or digitally simulated models of neural activity. The effect of white noise on interval histograms and their parameters is described and its effect when added to other inputs. Noise disrupts the phase-locked patterns produced by sinusoidal stimuli and the averaged response may become a smooth sinusoidal function in the presence of added noise. Adaptation may produce a phase lead to sinusoidal stimuli, while accommodation may produce a phase lag. Corresponding overshoots or undershoots are seen with square-wave inputs."
"This paper presents a technique whereby emphysema can be objectively graded by means of computerized image processing. Emphysema is a common disease affecting human lungs and is characterized by enlargement and destruction of the gas-exchanging portion of the lung, namely alveolar air sacs. This destruction of alveoli results in loss of alveolar surface area."
"The scan unit attains a rapid-image rate by rotating the sound source at a frequency of about 16 Hz in the focal point of an acoustic cylindrical paraboloid mirror. By this arrangement a scanning beam is obtained that moves with a speed of about 2 m/s transverse to the direction of propagation of the ultrasound. This scanning speed permits the buildup of a sectional image within about 60 ms with an image frequency of about 16 Hz. As the scanning procedure is automatic and not manual, a high degree of objectivity is obtained with respect to imaging of contours and particularly of inhomogeneous tissues. The above-mentioned image frequency also permits visualization of kinetic processes inside the body; these can be viewed on the fluorescent screen or filmed."
"Usually, the correlation function is obtained by using pure delay elements which are difficult to synthesize on an analog computer. In this paper a calculation procedure which approximates the correlation function by a polynomial is proposed. This procedure, based on an identification method developed by Izawa and Furuta ll, does not require any pure delay element but rather a bank of simple filters."
"An analog multiplexer which allows several data channels to share the available bandwidth of one channel of an analog tape recorder is described. The method involves demodulation by correlating with a separately recorded carrier. Inexpensive integrated circuits are the only active elements."
"Principal-components analysis is sometimes used in analysis of biophysical signals. Because the expansion coefficients obtained in this analysis have the property that they are uncorrelated, several authors made the extrapolation that the eigenfunctions of the covariance matrix, which also result from the principal- components analysis, correspond to independent physiological generators. By means of a theoretical example it is proved that this interpretation is unjustified because the eigenvectors are necessarily orthogonal due to the symmetry of the covariance matrix. Signals resulting from independent physiological generators do not necessarily have this property."
"Summary form only given, as follows. In a recent short communication named above (ibid., vol. BME-17, pp. 74-76, January 1970), there are several corrections to be made in the figures. In Fig. 1, page 75, in the base circuit of Q4 of the modulator, the 6.8 kΩ resistor, presently returned to -12 volts, should have been returned to ground. The junction of the 2 kΩ resistor in the Q4 base circuit and the 2.4 kΩ emitter resistor should have been +12 volts instead of ground. In Fig. 3, page 76, the HD1810 diode connected to the kQ2 input of the flip flop and to the base of the 2N3638 transistor should have been inverted."

"Transient thermal gradients in the brains of anesthetized cats and rabbits due to localized cooling to 5°C with probes of two different shapes were modeled successfully to within 0.5°C by a computer program utilizing a finite difference method and thermal coefficients of water, without addition of a term for metabolic heat or blood flow. Input data to the program required temperature measurements in the brain away from the probe, although in the cylindrical case it was possible to use the probe temperature as the forcing function by assuming that the probe had a larger diameter than was actually the case. The results indicate that for the experimental conditions, metabolic heat and blood flow can be adequately accounted for by means of a rather small adjustment of the thermal diffusivity term in a general diffusion equation, without need of an explicit term for such distributed sources."
"The optical radiation transfer of plane parallel isotropic scattering media is for many purposes of technical importance adequately described by the Kubelka and Munk equations. By a simple substitution these can be converted to the set of equations describing an electrical transmission line with resistive parameters. Consequently, such a line can be used to simulate the optical transfer of the medium. For practical purposes the continuous line may be replaced by the series connection of lumped parameter sections. Both transmittance and reflectance of the optical medium can be determined from voltage and current measurements on the model. The model can then be used to invert the transfer equations in terms of incremental absorbance as required in photometric or reflectometric analysis of thin-layer chromatograms, electrophoretograms, etc."
"For specified initial velocity and stopping distance, the acceleration-distance profile has a major influence on the extent of the injuries sustained by a human subject. Many trauma research and automotive and aircraft safety design considerations involve this relationship. The existence, uniqueness, and form of an acceleration profile which provides a minimum severity index are established in this paper. The profile is shown to produce a severity level 87 percent of that associated with a constant acceleration level. The form of this ``optimum'' profile is shown to be relatively insensitive to variations in the medical data utilized to develop the severity level. This result provides analytical support for work in areas where the medical data base is very limited."
"An extension of the contourography concept forms the basis for a new electrocardiographic (EKG) display system. The EKG is displayed in real time on the face of a variable-persistence cathoderay tube (CRT) in a contourographic format. This particular presentation emphasizes significant changes in the EKG from its established cyclic pattern. The continuous real-time contourogram facilitates on-line comparison of waveforms of successive EKG cycles, and allows instantaneous heart rate to be determined directly from a scale on the CRT face on a beat-by-beat basis. The simple controls and the straightforward nature of the display permit the real-time contourogram to be effectively monitored by qualified personnel without extensive training. Solid-state construction of the contourograph lends component stability, low cost, and high reliability to the entire system."
"This paper describes the use of power spectral density and cumulative power functions in the examination of the electromyogram (EMG). The EMG signals were obtained with surface electrodes from two muscles, the flexor pollicis brevis and the extensor digitorum, in four subjects. Each muscle was studied at two levels of contraction, both before and during fatigue. The power spectral density functions are compared, using a cumulative power difference function and the mean frequency of the spectrum, to determine differences between loading conditions in an individual muscle, before and during fatigue, between different muscles, between individuals (same muscle), and combinations of these conditions."
"The development and application of an electronic system which is capable of automatically detecting the K-complexes, aperiodic waveforms found in sleep electroencephalograms, is described. The system can be used either on- or off-line."
"The power output of flexible zinc and aluminum anodes in a plastic binder compared favorably with that of pure metals used in previous implantable hybrid cells. Cathodes of platinum and palladium black in a polyvinyl chloride binder compared well with cathodes of platinum black in teflon. In-vivo and in-vitro measurements on palladium black cathodes with a polyvinyl chloride binder indicate that they perform better than the platinum black cathodes using plastic binders. A spreading resistance measurement correlated with the catalytic activity of the cathode. Modified galvanostatic and spreading resistance measurements were used in in-vitro studies to evaluate the fabricated cathodes."
"A fast charging circuit for NiCd battery used in implant electronic systems is described. The circuit utilized the techniques of 1) sensing the internal gas pressure and temperature rise by sensing of the battery terminal voltage, and 2) setting the maximum charging current according to the concept of charge retention capacity, >95 percent after 100 cycles, of the battery. Experimental results show that a B-20 cell can be fully charged in 20 minutes instead of 14 hours."
"An equation of a continuous curve having the general form of the cardiac output curve has been derived in a logical fashion. The resulting equation of this curve originating at the origin is y = yp(x/xp)m exp (1 - (x/xp)m) where y and x are the vertical and horizontal components of the curve, yp and xp are the vertical and horizontal displacements of the curve at its peak, and m is a positive constant to be determined for each curve. This equation is integrated to determine the area under the curve it represents and appropriate substitutions are employed, with the result that the equation for the area is reduced to area = ypxpW where W is determined from a table included in the text."
"A four-channel frequency-modulation radio-telemetry system for the measurement of two electrocardiograms (EKGs), respiration rate, and pulmonary ventilation of human subjects during vigorous exercise is described. From the measurement of pulmonary ventilation, the oxygen uptake (and thus energy expenditure) was predicted. This is the first time (to the author's knowledge) that oxygen consumption has been predicted by telemetry of pulmonary ventilation for such sports as squash, handball, and track. The transmitter uses pulse-duration modulation. It has a range of approximately 100 meters, which may be extended by using a whip antenna. Linearity of the system is 2 percent or better from a best straight line, and baseline drift is less than 1 percent at 25°C. The telemetry transmitter weighs approximately 100 grams and is contained in two boxes measuring 5 by 5 by 1.25 cm. Construction of this system is considerably simplified through extensive use of integrated circuits. A complete transmitter costs about $50 (for components only) and dissipates approximately 60 mW. The batteries used provide a continuous life of 125 hours. The system has been used to obtain data from persons participating in squash, handball, track, and tennis. It may be used for many other physical activities."
"In circumstances where many channels of information are being multiplexed onto digital magnetic tape, it is required to monitor the multichannel signals on an oscilloscope at the time of recording and at subsequent playback. A simple method of achieving this using a single-beam oscilloscope is described."
"A suitable dielectric for a capacitive biomedical electrode is presented. In application a thin (2-mil) film of pyre varnish is deposited on the electrode surface and heat cured. Capacitance values of 800 pF for a 0.5-inch-diameter electrode are typical. A field-effect transistor source follower circuit is used in conjunction with this type of electrode."
"The use of constant current diodes in medical electronic equipment is discussed. Advantages of using the diodes instead of fuses include 1) instantaneous limiting of patient current to a safe value, and 2) the nonself-destructive operation of the diodes."
"A deformable cuff attached to a hydraulic activating mechanism provides a system suitable for intermittently occluding a collapsible tubular structure. When the apparatus in the system is constructed of materials such as silicon rubber and stainless steel, the system is chronically implantable. The system is designed so that it can be externally controlled after implantation."

"An electronic circuit for measuring the contraction time of the Achilles tendon reflex as detected on the Lawson kinemometer is described. The instrument obviates the need for recording and reduces the installation cost."
"A relatively simple instrumentation system is described which samples and records the body temperatures from up to twelve experimental animals over long periods of time. Body temperatures are sensed by temperature-sensitive FM transmitters implanted in the peritoneal cavities. The emitted signals are received by antennas, amplified, and sequentially gated into a frequency counter for counting; the resulting digital numbers are recorded in binarycoded decimal (BCD) format on punched paper tape. Samples can be spaced at intervals of from 1 to 60 minutes, and sampling can be continued over long periods of many months. This system eliminates the need for analog-to-digital conversion and allows rapid and direct transmission of the raw data to the digital computer for processing and analysis."

 "We consider a class of straight line programs admitting structured variables. It is easy to associate with each program a set of expressions which reflects the natural meaning of a structured variable such as an array. However, the question of whether two such expressions are equivalent depends on what is assumed about the possible initial values of the variables and what algebraic laws are assumed to apply. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for two such assumptions to yield the same equivalences among expressions. The assumption which gives the smallest set of equivalences is exhibited. This assumption plays the role of \"strong equivalence,\" since it implies equivalence under any possible interpretation of the model which leaves the interpretation of \"structure\" as we define it."
"A model for parallel computation called a schema is presented. This model is similar to that presented in the recent work of Karp and Miller2. Section 1 presents a description of the model, and some results on the characterization of computations within it. Section 2 summarizes some results on determinacy and equivalence. Section 3 presents a formalization of the property of maximal parallelism in schemata. Several alternate characterizations are shown to be equivalent for certain classes. Section 4 presents results on the complexity of a maximally parallel schema equivalent to a given schema."
 "We study the effect of program structure on computational efficiency in a class of abstract languages which model actual high-level numerical programming languages (like ALGOL). The results have bearing on programming technique (the use of go to statements), and they yield interesting facts about Blum's speed-up theorem for subrecursive computational complexity."
"Optimality, to within a multiplicative constant, is shown for some algorithms dealing with vectors and finite sets. Among the problems discussed are: Is vector x equal to vector y ? Given two finite sets A and B, is A = B ? Is A ⊆ B ? Is A ∩ B = φ ? What is |A ∩ B| ? What is |A - B| ? Is A - B = φ ?"
"The computational power of 2-way pushdown automata with m additional counters (called mC-PDA) is investigated. It is shown that any multi-tape Turingmachine (with a two-way input tape) which accepts within time T(n), where n is the input length, can be simulated by a 3C-PDA whose counters are bounded by T(n) and that any such Turing machine can also be simulated by a 2C-PDA whose counters are bounded by T(n)2. A number of other results relating the power of 1C-PDA and that of other types of machines are also obtained."
 "It is an open problem, suggested by Papert and McNaughton, to find a decision procedure for determining whether a regular event is locally testable. In this paper we provide a partial solution, giving two effectively decidable conditions, one necessary and one sufficient, for local testability. Our proofs are for the most part algebraic, using machine decompositions and semigroup theory."
"La représentation matricielle minimale attachée à une série rationnelle en variables non commutatives permet de généraliser à ces séries des résultats connus en théorie des langages. Les méthodes employées permettent aussi d'étudier les parties rationnelles de certains monoïdes comme le groupe libre."
"A new flow table for describing normal-fundamental-mode (NFM) asynchronous machines, the ADSE table, is introduced. Although the structure of this table has several ramifications in the area of circuit realization, this paper emphasizes its utility in generating checking experiments for NFM asynchronous machines. Using the ADSE table, a procedure is presented that allows existing (or future) methods for constructing synchronous checking experiments to be used directly to obtain the desired asynchronous checking experiment."
 "This paper deals with hazards on out-puts of combinational switching circuits for multiple input changes. Certain types of function hazards are defined and are shown to be impossible to eliminate with any logic realization. Also, an interrelation between static and dynamic function hazards is established. Hazards due to delays in the logic are defined and a method of elimination is given for both the static and dynamic case."
"The simultaneous use of delayed and undelayed versions of the internal variables permits the realization of normal fundamental mode circuits with less restricted state assignments than the usual single transition time state assignments. This paper is concerned with problems associated with these state assignments."
"The problem of designing asynchronous circuits where the changes in binary input signals occur independently of one another is discussed. If several input changes occur within some interval δ1, the circuit behaves as though the changes were simultaneous. If consecutive changes are spaced by intervals exceeding some longer interval δ2 then the circuit reacts as though a sequence of single changes had occurred. But when the spacing is between these values, the system may react in an unsatisfactory manner unless special attention is paid to the problem during the design process. Constraints imposed by this problem on the row assignment and on the delay elements are derived, as well as a method for computing δ1 and δ2."
"The notion of context-free LR(K) and LL(K) grammars and of the related bottom-up and top-down syntax-directed parsings are well known [1,2,3]. In this report we present a number of synthesis algorithms which take a non-self-embedding, sequential, context-free grammar and produce the finite state transducer which either top-down or bottom-up parses sentences in the language induced by the grammar if this grammar is finite state LL(K) respectively LR(K). This later property is decidable."
"Syntactic clues are aids to parsing. The amount of nondeterminism in parsers for pairs of homomorphically related semithue language systems is compared. If the parsers are without lookahead, the domain language system parser has no more nondeterminism than the codomain language system parser. The domain language system has at least as many clues. If the parsers have lookahead and the homomorphism is nondecreasing the same results hold. If the homomorphism is nonincreasing, an example shows the codomain language system may have the better clues."
"Left corner parsing refers to a class of parsing procedures in which the productions are recognized in a particular order which is different than both bottom up and top down. Each production is recognized after its left descendant but before its other descendants. Procedures in this class have occurred frequently in the compiler literature. In this paper a class of grammars, called LC (k) grammars, is defined and shown to be exactly those grammars for which a certain canonical pushdown machine that does left corner parsing is deterministic. A subset of LC(k) grammars, called strong LC(k) grammars, is defined and shown to be those grammars that can be deterministically left corner parsed by a simplified canonical machine. It is shown that when a particular grammatical rewriting procedure is applied to a grammar, the resulting grammar is (strong) LL(k) if and only if the original grammar is (strong) LC(k). This implies that the class of LC(k) languages is identical to the class of LL(k) languages. The syntax directed translations on LC(k) grammars that can be performed by the canonical pushdown machine are also discussed."
"Two classes of restricted top down parsing algorithms using backtrack are considered. We show that the smaller class recognizes all deterministic context free languages, and that both classes can be simulated in linear time on a random access machine. Certain generalizations of these parsing algorithms are shown equivalent to the larger class. Finally, some decision and closure properties of the classes of languages defined are given."
  "Complex behavior by machines can be achieved by either having a large number of very simple machines or by having a complex machine with which to start. Our primary interest in this paper was with the former. By considering the global behavior of a large number of the simplest of machines, the following results were shown: 1. An array of identical square cells each of which can exist in only four states and communicates with its four nearest neighbors (forming a neighborhood of five cells) can a) perform any computation which is computable and b) construct (almost) any configuration--in particular, it can be self-reproducing. Cells capable of the first behavior are called universal computers; the second behavior characterizes the universal constructor. 2. A three state, five neighbor cell is capable of universal computation when configured in a finite initial area. 3. Two states and five neighbors are sufficient for universal computation, but require an infinite initial configuration. Being parallel machines, these cellular automata can serve as a good theoretical basis for parallel computation and should be useful mathematically in many of the same areas as the Turing Machine. Practical physical applications were also indicated."
"A set of equivalences is established among cellular automata, iterative acceptors, and linear-bounded automata. However, cellular automata are shown to be inherently faster than iterative acceptors. Many positive results are presented to indicate that the context-free languages can, perhaps, be accepted in time n and space n by cellular automata."
"The \"deadlock\" problem is a logical problem which may occur in a system in which resources are shared among users. Deadlock is a situation in which two or more jobs cannot be completed because of conflicting resource requirements. In this paper we assume that advance information about future resource requirements of jobs is available. In particular, we assume that jobs are represented as a sequence of \"job steps\" during which the resource usage remains constant. An algorithm which uses this information to determine whether a request can be granted without causing a deadlock is presented."
"The aim of this paper is not the establishment of new results, but the understanding, from a machine theoretic point of view, of results originally arrived at by algebraic means. A new criterion for series parallel irreducibility is given which makes no reference to underlying semigroups but involves only series parallel operations. Also, the irreducibility of prime counter machines is established using only machine theoretic methods."
"Presents the front cover/table of contents for this issue of the periodical."
  "In conventional digital differential analyzers (DDA), the word length used for the transmission of information between integrators is restricted to at most a single magnitude bit and a sign bit. This restriction seriously limits integrator frequency response and has to a large extent been responsible for the failure of DDAs to achieve widespread acceptance as general purpose differential analyzers. In this paper it is shown that DDA speed and accuracy can be greatly improved by using increment word lengths which are approximately one-half the length of integrand registers providing that integration formulas more accurate than Euler integration are used. The programming of such machines for the solution of both linear and nonlinear differential equations is discussed and a quantitative evaluation of performance improvement is presented. At the same time, an effort is made to isolate the principal difficulties in hardware implementation which result from extending the integrator increment resolution."
"An interactive technique for statistical tolerance analysis has been developed for a computer with graphic display. The computer program called TAP provides for random perturbation of parameter values, repeated evaluation of system performance, and display of distribution histograms. The interactive capability of the program enables the designer to introduce modifications to the system so that the relative effects of these changes can be quickly evaluated with the graphic display. The program has been implemented on a computer facility consisting of a CDC 3300 digital computer, an ITT digital display scope, and an EAI 8800 analog computer. Two applications are discussed to illustrate the adaptability of the technique to either linear or nonlinear problems. The digital simulation of an active circuit is used to show how the interaction with graphic display saves time in evaluating alternative designs. A hybrid simulation of an equalizer for a digital transmission system illustrates that complex time domain problems can be economically analyzed using TAP. In addition, it is shown how TAP is used to measure the reproducibility of an analog simulation."
"A technique is presented to implement a class of orthogonal transformations on the order of pN logp N operations. The technique is due to Good [1] and implements a fast Fourier transform, fast Hadamard transform, and a variety of other orthogonal decompositions. It is shown how the Kronecker product can be mathematically defined and efficiently implemented using a matrix factorization method. A generalized spectral analysis is suggested, and a variety of examples are presented displaying various properties of the decompositions possible. Finally, an eigenvalue presentation is provided as a possible means of characterizing some of the transforms with similar parameters."
"In view of the speed of today's hardware components, wirings between IC pins cannot be regarded as ``short circuit jumper+some C'' but should be treated as a piece of transmission line. The central problem in design of any equipment employing a number of IC is thus to predict the extent of gradual deterioration of waveforms as pulses propagate along a length of transmission line loaded with many lumped constant loads at distances. A simulation technique for this problem is introduced in the paper, and the technique is more practical than those previously described."
"A design for a binary adder-checker system which employs residue codes to detect any error resulting from a single fixed fault is presented. In an adder, special functional relationships must exist, regardless of the particular logical realization. Consequently, for adders with either serial or parallel carry propagation, the worst possible error can be described precisely. Certain residue codes may then be used to detect that error by means of a simple checking algorithm with a minimnum of extra circuitry."
"In this paper we concern ourselves with the problem of obtaining high sequence rate sequential machines; machines which are constructed from realistic devices to operate at an input sequence rate which is independent of the machine complexity. To accomplish this result we have only to show a construction to realize acceptably synchronous devices from badly timed, restricted fan-in and fan-out devices. Once a complete set of synchronous devices is obtained, the results of Arden [1] and Arthurs [2] apply, and we know that any finite state machine has a realization using these devices which accepts input sequence members at a rate that is characteristic of the set of devices, not of the machine. The technique we propose for achieving this result is to produce a lattice of interconnected clock pulse sources called clock pulse propagators (CPP). These devices generate clock pulses which are acceptably synchronized with respect to the outputs of neighboring CPP's but are not required to be in synchronization with some machine-wide standard as in current practice. Once it is established that such a network is possible, techniques already known can be applied in the utilization of the clock pulses to synchronize logic and signals. Part I of the paper concerns the analysis of CPP networks and Part II1 covers the synthesis of sequential machines using CPP networks as clocking sources."
"This paper describes the organization of a multi-module memory, designed to facilitate parallel block transfers. All modules are assumed to be identical, and the individual modules can fetch or store no more than one word or word group during any single memory cycle. Parallel block transfers are made possible in multimodule memories by utilizing a device called the memory circulator and by organizing the memory in a particular way. The memory circulator consists of a bank of interconnected registers, one for each memory, and control circuitry. The memory system is organized so that ascending logical addresses are distributed cyclically among the modules. If there are 2b modules, then any individual word is accessed by using the least significant b bits of a memory address to select a module and by using the remaining bits to select an address within a module. The memory circulator can load and store a contiguous block of 2b words by selecting all modules and broadcasting a single address to all modules. A contiguous block can be displaced in memory by a multiple of 2b words by broadcasting different load and store addresses for a block of data. The circulator control circuitry includes a masking capability so that blocks smaller than 2b can be moved in this fashion. When the displacement of a block transfer is not a multiple of 2b a physical circulation of the data in the memory circulator registers is required."
"Synthesis techniques are presented for realizing an arbitrary synchronous flow table in the form of an array of identical modules interconnected in a regular pattern. Several types of structures and their corresponding modules are considered, and a relationship between these structures and earlier work on combinational circuits is shown."
"This paper is Part II of a two-part study of systematic procedures for realizing synchronous sequential machines using flip-flop memory. In this study the methods of Dolotta and McCluskey, and Weiner and Smith are generalized so that they can be used to obtain directly good realizations of machines using flip-flop memory. In Part I the generalizations were simple, straightforward, and required a minimal amount of changes to the basic methods. For machines using trigger flip-flop memory or a combination of trigger and set-reset, or trigger and J-K flip-flops, these generalizations usually yield significantly better realizations than those obtained from the use of the ungeneralized versions of these methods along with methods for transforming the resulting next-state functions into flip-flop input functions. Minimization of changes of these methods was achieved at the expense of imposing the restriction that the inputs to each of the set-reset and J-K flip-flop types be complementary. In the present paper further generalizations for obtaining even better realizations using trigger, set-reset, and J-K flip-flops are developed by dropping the aforementioned restriction."
"If, as presently projected, the cost of microelectronic arrays in the future will tend to reflect the number of pins on the array rather than the number of gates, the logic-in-memory array is an extremely attractive computer component. Such an array is essentially a microelectronic memory with some combinational logic associated with each storage element. A logic-in-memory computer is described that is organized around a logic-enhanced ``cache'' memory array. Used as a cache, a logic-in-memory array performs as a high-speed buffer between a conventional CPU and a conventional memory. The effect on the computer system of the cache and its control mechanism is to make the main memory appear to have all of the processing capabilities and almost the same performance as the cache. Operations within the array are naturally organized as operations on blocks of data called ``sectors.'' Among the operations that can be performed are arithmetic and logical operations on pairs of elements from two sectors, and a variety of associative search operations on a single sector. For such operations, the main memory of the computer appears to the program to be composed of a collection of logic-in-memory arrays, each the size of a sector. Because of the high-speed, highly parallel sector operations, the logic-in-memory computer points to a new direction for achieving orders of magnitude increase in computer performance. Moreover, since the computer is specifically organized for large-scale integration, the increased performance might be obtained for a comparatively small dollar cost."
"An efficient matrix algorithm is described which enables one to determine the complete connection matrix in only two steps."
"Extensions to a straightforward, always convergent method for solving polynomial equations given in a previous paper are considered. The extensions consist of additional simple calculations and logic instructions which considerably improve convergence rate for the cases when multiple roots exist or when roots are close together. It is believed that in terms of simplicity and convergence properties, the approach is more efficient than presently available methods."
"The use of published theorems on least times to perform arithmetic operations as aids in optimizing logic circuit designs is discussed. An illustrative example is presented involving the optimum maximum fan-in of circuits in a binary adder."

   "Between 1916 and 1920, the foundations of the Mullard Company, which celebrated its 50th anniversary last month, were laid by a small team of workers developing high-power transmitting valves for the Admiralty. In this article, the founder of the company - himself a member of that team - recalls some of the early work on these valves and how it led to the creation of a new industry."
  "Man seems destined to estrange himself from his natural environment. He does not wish to isolate himself in this way, but seems likely, nevertheless, to do so in the end. As a true creature of technology, man would become a particularly curious evolutionary phenomenon, and his metamorphosis would raise fundamental questions about the nature of evolution itself. Some aspects of these questions, which would increasingly involve technology on its own account, are discussed in this article."
                               "Electrical research on railways covers a very wide range of projects, ranging from gas-discharge physics through communication and computing to heavy-current engineering. It requires the co-ordinated efforts of multidisciplinary teams of engineers, physicists and mathematicians. By extending the technology already developed by the railway industry and introducing new concepts and techniques, these projects hold promise of improving the quality and economy of railways, and of maintaining them as one of the major transport systems."
         "The application of electronics to motor cars potentially offers a variety of advantages - improved safety, performance, reliability, convenience and cost, or some combination of these. That these advantages are already being realised is indicated by the fact that, in America, the car-electronics market (excluding car radios) in 1967-68 was about $1 per car and at that time was predicted to be $7 per car in 1970 and $18 per car in 1972. The present indications are that these estimates are probably too low."
       "It seems certain that electronic techniques will be employed on an increasing scale in both conventional and new items of electrical equipment for vehicles in future years. Already electronic techniques have made an impact in the rectification and control circuits for alternators, and in ignition systems and headlamps."
       "The use of electronic methods of measurement in the motor industry has increased rapidly over the last few years, as the need to design vehicles for maximum performance and reliability at minimum cost has become increasingly essential and the motorist has become progressively more demanding in these matters and in his concern with handling, noise, safety and mechanical sophistication. A wide range of equipment and testing techniques of increasing complexity has been introduced, much of it originating in the aircraft industry; but increasingly the motor industry is developing specialised techniques to deal with the problems which are peculiarly its own."
"No longer can rivers and other bodies of water be considered as dumping grounds for untreated waste products. A variety of electrochemical treatments now exists for rendering toxic effluents harmless, Many of these processes can be combined with recovery of expensive metals, thereby making them doubly attractive to the industrialist."
"Mankind has a variety of energy needs, which can be satisfied in many ways; the electricity-supply industry must match the needs of the market, and its objective is to maximise value to consumers and to minimise the cost of resources. This article surveys the applications of electricity and reviews the generation, transmission and distribution technologies."
"The 1.5 MW experimental fast reactor at Dounreay has been operating since 1959; the UKAEA is now building a 250 MW prototype fast reactor there, which is due for completion in 1972, and should act as a stepping stone to the design and construction of large commercial fast reactors."
  "`The essence of quality control lies in precise product description and manufacturing conformance, and the word \"quality\" has no part in either'"
"Learning machines have posed a challenge to the electronics engineer for many years. Most work has stemmed from making simple models of the neurons of the brain. It is likely, however, that, with digital cells intended for construction in microcircuit form (not necessarily as brain-cell models), new learning machines that are much more powerful than their predecessors can be made."
                      "Although electroluminescence was discovered nearly 70 years ago, it is only in the last decade that devices using the effect have become of any real practical importance. The spectacular developments of the last few years have been achieved by the improvement of materials technology coupled with a better understanding of the electroluminescent process."
 "In the past, designers and manufacturers have played a part in the production of safety standards for equipment. Now there is increasing pressure for an independent authority - as exists already in some countries - in the UK to certify safety standards. The designer's dilemma is whether to continue to design f or safety or whether to design for maximum probability of receiving the approval of the approbation authority."
 "What can we know of the outside world via our contact through the senses, when the object studied, the transmission of information about the object and the sensation we have in our brain are totally different in kind? Using the gramophone record as a starting point, the author traces the transmission of the information encoded in the disc to the human brain, and shows that the knowledge we receive can be consistent, and can be explained and predicted with success."
"The CEGB's Midlands Region has established an information system which enables it to predict the overall performance of its plant throughout the year. The system bypasses the conventional hierarchal structure, and eliminates many of the distortions introduced in the usual management reporting chains."
              "The advent of the nuclear-breeder reactor promises an abundant, cheap and flexible source of energy which can be used as a basic raw material by the underdeveloped nations. Agro-industrial complexes based on such reactors could provide food, basic raw materials and industry in the vast arid coastal regions of the world."
         "There are signs that Norway's reliance on water power, which makes it the country with the greatest per capita power generated, is drawing to an end. Norway is looking to nuclear and thermal stations to supply some of its needs, and an h.v.d.c. link to Denmark is likely. Norway's manufacturing industries are tending to look beyond their traditional home markets."
 "Telecommunication switching systems allow people to intercommunicate - originally this was by talking over the telephone; now data terminals and computers require to be interconnected, and the telephone call itself has become more complex with the advent of national and international subscriber dialling. New features are intended to make the life of the telephone user easier and the system itself more effective."
"During the last two decades there has been a considerable increase in the application of scientific and engineering techniques to medicine and biology. Many devices requiring power have been invented for research or remedial purposes, and are in use in, on or around the body. This article reviews these power requirements, and describes the novel, as well as the more conventional, sources which are being applied or developed to meet them."
       "As the demand for qualified teachers grows at an increasingly critical rate, the concept of an educational closed-circuit television system offers the possibility of extending the highest possible teaching standards to the maximum number of pupils. The concentration of educational establishments in London now has the benefit of such a scheme, and this article describes the complete transmission chain from the studio camera to the classroom television receiver."
   "A new process for the production of integrated circuits is expected to lead to better device yields and improved reliability of finished devices, particularly for m.o.s. components."
            "A completely new thermal-rating standard for power transformers is at present being considered by an international working group. The thermal design of a transformer should depend on a predetermined value of the hottest-spot temperature, and the new standard will enable this to be determined precisely."
"A nation's prosperity depends on the production of wealth by its industries, and investment in technology is one of the best ways of creating wealth. The economic performances of many companies leave a lot to be desired, but there are ways and means of quantifying and improving the generation of wealth. If engineers became more involved in management, the results could be beneficial to industry."
                    "Powerful computer programs are now available to ease the tedium of circuit analysis. This article illustrates the potential and simplicity of one such program by describing its application to a simple d.c. circuit and a more complex nonlinear circuit."
        "Engineers can learn a great deal from studying the human brain, in such fields as man-machine interaction, pattern recognition, communication and computers. Although in the early days of computers it was believed that their action was similar to that of the brain, it is now known that the resemblance between the computer and the brain is only superficial, and new theories have to be devised to explain the brain's operation."
             "Apollo lunar-landing missions depend on effective co-ordination of space-vehicle and ground-system operations. The telecommunication support role is to ensure that the needed information is transferred reliably and effectively. For Apollo, such support is accomplished primarily by the tracking and data-acquisition facilities of the Manned Space Flight Network and the point-to-point communication capabilities of the NASA communication network. This article describes the functions of these networks as they are used with the space vehicles and the mission-control centre for the Apollo lunar-landing programme."
"The field over an open-sided linear motor contains a rotating component which can be used to spin rotors In a manner that is analogous to a rack-and-pinion action. If the rotor is made up of a stack of washers-a divided-cylinder rotor-some Interesting effects can be obtained."
"Charles Wheatstone is generally remembered for the electrical measuring bridge that bears his name, although it was not his invention ; he merely developed it into a practical technique. It is less well known that he made many important contributions to the early development of electrical machines, and was one of the inventors of the self-excited generator, which eventually made possible the large-scale generation of electricity as we know it today."
                     "Is there a technology gap between the United States and Western Europe? Scientific inventions and innovations in Western Europe suggest that there is no technology gap, but, if it does exist, it is to a large extent a direct result of a management gap."
"It is highly desirable for reliability to be a `built-in' feature of electronic equipment. This article describes a 10-year development of three generations of radio equipment and raises some general aspects of reliability."
 "The construction of the Victoria line has been the largest single piece of engineering ever to be undertaken in London. When the line was opened, it was the most advanced passenger railway anywhere in the world, and uses important new concepts of automatic driving, fare collection and train control. However, the line was not completed until 16 years after its conception - an indication of the foresight necessary when considering further developments such as the proposed Fleet line."
             "Architecture and engineering ultimately share the same ends and the same common principles. They appear more widely separated because the growth of modern technology has brought with it a wider field of knowledge, a greater division of labour and increasing specialisation of skills. One can identify large architectural projects such as housing estates, universities or new towns for which civil, structural and mechanical engineers are indispensable as consultants. Their advice modifies the basic design of the project, but it does not create it. Similarly one can find large engineering projects, such as bridges, motorways or power stations to which architects, landscape architects and industrial designers have contributed both integrally and in detail, but which they do not design."
        "When generating an outline of a solid object as a computer display, it is often desirable to suppress, or distinguish, those parts of the 3-dimensional view of the outline which cannot be seen in reality. A program has been written which achieves this end; although it suffers from certain limitations in its present experimental form, it has advantages as a design aid over the normal skeleton-like displays."
        "Traditionally, the nucleus of radio installations on board large ships has been essential safety equipment, but on modern ships it may represent only one fifth of total radiocommunication equipment. Specialised radio services now include such items as the transmission of weather reports and daily newspapers. Although integrated systems employing high-reliability solid-state devices are being increasingly used, the rugged valve is still more economical at medium and high radio-frequency powers."
                        "The Picturephone service, due to open in the United States in summer 1970, is a video-telephone system operating to a large extent over the existing telephone network. As well as face-to-face communication between subscribers, it can transmit graphical information and can be used in conjunction with a time-sharing computer to give subscriber-computer communication."
            "The Hungarian engineering genius Dr. Kalman Kando was the first to create a railway-electrification system working at utility frequency and integrated into a public utility system. The key to his system was a locomotive on which a synchronous phase convertor changed the single-phase contact-wire energy to the polyphase-induction-traction-motor energy. The synchronous machine could run with unity power factor. The locomotives had a constant efficiency of 83% and regenerative braking. Three sections of the single-phase railway line took the three phases of the utility network. The Hungarian railway electrification based on Kando's system was started with strong British support, and two of Britain's largest manufacturers, Metropolitan-Vickers and English Electric, supplied a substantial part of the equipment."
 "Measurement of the heart's flow output can be of particular value in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cardiac disorders. One technique applicable to such patients is the thermal-dilution method, which involves measurement of a small temperature change in the bloodstream resulting from injection of a bolus of cool liquid upstream of the observation point. Simple analogue-computing techniques can provide a direct reading of cardiac output, and rapid serial measurements are obtainable."
       "The United Kingdom is some way behind other countries in the application of modern scientific knowledge to the practical development of equipment for the exploitation of the seas, even though much of this knowledge emanated from scientists in the United Kingdom. The future prosperity of the country demands that we establish our position in this growing field of activity, and there is still time to do so if the support required is forthcoming."
"Conventional methods of data acquisition are being challenged by new engineering philosophies as well as the availability of integrated circuits and other advances in hardware. The frequency-domain approach, in which analogue voltages are converted to frequencies at source, shows great promise, and eliminates many of the problems associated with analogue-digital conversion and relay scanning. As new design philosophies for data-acquisition equipment emerge, so new types of application are made possible."
"Many people in industry remain unaware of the value of marketing research; yet, if properly carried out, it can add just as much to a company's profits as product research, and can help to avoid many pitfalls into which companies might otherwise fall."
"As the world need for electric power grows, so the need arises for new techniques of transmitting large amounts of power over great distances. In addition to extra-high-voltage a.c. and high-voltage d.c. transmission systems, two radically new techniques are the use of superconducting cables and the use of large circular waveguides. Although there are technological problems, it seems that waveguides could offer an economical alternative to other systems."
                            "Radar is used extensively in anticipating widely different weather conditions and for a better understanding of atmospheric phenomena. The full force of a hurricane can be avoided if its formation can be anticipated, aircraft can be better protected by more accurate and detailed weather forecasts and countries dependent on rainfall limited to a short period in the year can profit from advance knowledge of river flow and accumulation of water in lakes and reservoirs."
"In this shortened version of his IEE presidential address, Lord Nelson discusses the growth and development of the electrical manufacturing industries, and considers the effects on the industry of the rapid technical advances of recent years. The changes which have already taken place are outlined, and the challenges of the future are analysed. Finally, the role of the engineer in management is discussed, and the IEE is urged to help its members to acquire expertise in the managerial field."
             "The `gap' between the electrical industry in Poland and those in the leading technological countries is estimated to be about 10-15 years, but, although at present only 2% of the value of the output of the electrical industry in Poland is spent on research, development plans aim to reduce the gap greatly within the next 15 years."
 "The future of the circuit designer cannot be reviewed separately from the future of electronics. As developments in electronics. As in turn, largely dictated by the needs of society, any speculation about the future must start in terms of the future needs of society. A number of mathematical models, based on this type of premise, have already given remarkably accurate results. The role of the circuit designer is bound to change. However, the total activity of designers is bound to be enhanced by the changing pattern in electronics."
 "Area Electricity Boards can only influence a small proportion of their total operating costs by improving operating efficiency. Ways of improving efficiency include better use of manpower, use of computers for dealing with economic and technical matters, lowering of engineering costs by increased standardisation and exploitation of new materials and techniques, and the centralisation of meter-testing facilities. Future contributions to improved efficiency include ripple control, automatic supervision and telemetering, and the use of new types of switchgear."
"The worlds of science and technology are closely interdependent, and any industrial organisation setting out to do research and development work must recognise this by integrating the two functions in its research activity. Similar criteria apply to government involvement in science and industry. Science and technology are also closely involved with society in general, and political and economic trends can seriously affect the well being of the technological community."
        "The planning and organisation of inspection to control production require the modification of many techniques. This article discusses the extension of a section of statistical methodology to maintain the quality and integrity of a product, from the incoming components and raw materials, through various stages of manufacture, to dispatch of the finished article to the customer."
"Since the publication of the Herbert Report in 1954, it has been inferred that the UK electricity-supply industry is not as efficient as it ought to be. However, since vesting day in 1948, the 12 distribution area boards in England and Wales have markedly improved their economic efficiencies and now employ efficiency techniques such as work study and value analysis to a greater degree than ever before."
"Many schools are taking the first steps to bring education in the operation and use of computers into curricula. In order to teach the principles of computing to children, a special type of demonstration machine is necessary, and such a machine has been developed and used in several UK schools."
"At a meeting of the IEE Council on the 8th January 1970, Sir Hamish MacLaren was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Institution 'for his contributions to naval electrical engineering and for his devoted service to the Institution'. The IEE Council also made the 48th award of the Faraday Medal to Prof. C.W. Oatley 'for his many contributions to the development of microwave techniques and particularly for his outstanding leadership of the team at Cambridge University responsible for the development of the scanning electron microscope'."
 "The extent of the lighting required at an airport depends on the landing and takeoff characteristics of the aircraft that will use it, and on the visibility conditions in which it will be operational. The problems of airport lighting are discussed here with particular reference to the installation for the new runway at Liverpool Airport, which is one of the most elaborate and up to date in Britain."
 "In the emerging pattern of the electrical-machine industry, the influence of international combines of both users and manufacturers and the increasing size and reduced number of such units present the ideal conditions for the evolution of an international standard electrical machine, and there appears to be no reason why Britain should not take the lead in this project as it has done in so many other forms of engendering in the past."
                                            "With the support of federal and state-government grants, educational television is being used to solve a number of problems facing engineering educators in the state of Colorado. Industrial personnel can now study from a wide selection of university level courses without leaving their work locations, and college students have the opportunity to transfer directly to university with all prerequisite courses completed. Although the problems of continuing education in industry and college transfer requirements are somewhat peculiar to the United States, the techniques used to solve these problems could find application in the British educational system."
  "Operating efficiency increases with the processing power of a computer, and therefore there is a continuous market demand for larger computers. Meeting this demand poses difficult design problems for the computer manufacturer which can be solved most efficiently by using automation techniques. In this article, the author describes the automation techniques employed in the design and manufacture of International Computers Ltd.'s 1906A computer."
"Power transistors have been used in large-scale applications for little more than ten years; yet already they are poised to take over from vacuum tubes in all applications except high-power transmitters. More than any other discrete component, power transistors rival integrated circuits in potential and growth. From a small start in automobile radios, their applications now range from high-quality stereo amplifiers to high-voltage television deflection systems."
         "Forward planning is a comparatively recent development in industry, but the 1970s could see a revolution in planning techniques concerned with the overall scene, including technical, economic, social and political factors. A number of techniques have grown up under the general heading of 'technological forecasting' with the aim of quantifying the benefits of innovation. This article reviews these techniques and their applications to corporate long-range planning."
"Synthetic polymer films are now becoming widely used in the production of wound electrical capacitors with large capacitances, particularly in electronics applications. The advantages of metallised plastics capacitors are size, performance and cost. Future developments could include the encroachment of these devices into the fields of microminiaturisation and high power."

 "The two methods described for giving voices to computers recognize the importance of economical storage of speech information and extensive vocabularies, and consequently are based on principles of speech synthesis. The first, formant synthesis, generates connected speech from low-bit-rate representations of spoken words. The second, text synthesis, produces connected speech solely from printed English text. For both methods the machine must contain stored knowledge of fundamental rules of language and acoustic constraints of human speech. Formant synthesis from an input information rate of about 1000 bits per second is demonstrated, as is text synthesis from a rate of about 75 bits per second. To give the reader an opportunity to evaluate some of the results described, a sample recording is available; see Appendix A for details."
"The purpose of this article is to categorize the needs and desired features that a logic or system designer should consider when selecting a family of digital integrated circuits. The various major digital IC families are evaluated and compared with these needs in view. The intended results are that the reader will gain facility in IC technology, terminology, and usage in various areas of application. Part II of this article will cover transistor-transistor logic (TTL) devices. Part III is devoted to emitter-coupled logic (ECL) and metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) devices."

"The transmission of electromagnetic energy through seawater is so heavily attenuated that it is necessary to turn to acoustic energy to transmit information over any appreciable range of ocean. In the sea, the absorption of acoustic energy is several orders of magnitude less than that of electromagnetic waves. Still, this absorption constitutes a limitation on the bandwidth of the communication link. In addition, the upper and lower boundaries of the ocean, and the multipaths caused by them, distort the communication path and further reduce the usable bandwidth."
"The idea of coding the human voice into digital pulses was conceived more than three decades ago; exploitation had to await the ushering in of the transistor era. Since then, coding systems gradually have improved. One of the latest and most efficient schemes is delta modulation. Compared with earlier analog-to-digital-pulse conversion systems, an increase in the voice-handling capacity of telephone equipment by a factor of two or more has been made possible. At the same time, equipment requirements have become less stringent."
"Proper coordination in the design of a transportation system requires consideration of general land use in the area served, and indeed of the entire sociological and ecological fabric of society. Moreover, the designer must help weave this fabric while it is being used. A possible starting place for a transportation study, and some would argue the only starting place, is an overall regional plan. More and more it is being clearly recognized that a transportation link not only satisfies established needs in a region but also develops and anticipates others."

 "The shifting patterns of the U.S. electronics industry, and the consequent rising unemployment among engineers, is a matter of great concern to the IEEE Board of Directors. It is clear that the industry of the 1970s will be different, in many respects, from that of the last decade, and that the new directions will create new challenges for IEEE members and demand new skills of them."
"The effect of termination of employment on pension benefits has become a matter of grave concern to engineers and scientists in the United States, particularly to those in the professions served by IEEE. In many cases during the postwar years, the decision to transfer from one employer to another has been a voluntary act of the professional worker and he could measure the cost of losing future pension benefits against the advantages of taking a new job. But within the last two years, a major change has occurred in the space and defense industries and their suppliers, which are so largely dependent upon government support of scientific and engineering work. In addition to discussing current pension practices in the United States, this report includes a review of activities by societies in this field, and the limitations imposed by legal and economic forces."
 "It is not enough to depend upon diffusivity to dissipate the heat from a gas laser. Under the circumstances, average power outputs are too limited. By generating flow within the gas and deriving the benefits of forced convection, performance is improved. But if flow can be used to improve power outputs, it also can be used to advance a step further and generate the conditions that are necessary for lasing action-thereby creating a gasdynamic laser. This article covers the theory behind such a device and describes an experimental unit that has proved the merit of the concept."

"TTL devices offer the distinct advantages of many complex functions, compatibility with DTL, and adaptability to many designs, including some highly complex ones. Because of their wide availability in the market, they are extremely attractive from an applications and price standpoint. This second part of a three-part article describes their use in medium- and high-speed circuits and also covers Schottky TTL devices."
"An aircraft electric system designed around a solid-state approach offers many potential advantages over an electromechanical counterpart. These include higher reliability, longer life, more ruggedness, more versatility, and better compatibility. To achieve these advantages, however, it is not merely sufficient to replace electromechanical components with their solid-state equivalents. Here is one approach that has been tested in the laboratory and in aircraft during the past ten years-with success. Included is a report on an advanced system undergoing evaluation."

 "A common denominator of most sophisticated manufacturing equipment is a positioning system. A part or workpiece must be brought into a predefined location envelope so that operations may be performed upon it. Since much of this type of manufacturing equipment is computer-controlled, flexible positioning systems are necessary to derive all of the advantages that the computer can provide. Flexibility can be achieved via closed-or open-loop motor-driven systems-each offering distinct advantages. But whereas stepper motors are optional in the former instance, for an open-loop system, a digital driving device such as a stepper motor must be used to maintain control."
"This final installment of a three-part article is devoted to emitter-coupled logic (ECL) devices as well as to metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) logic devices of the p-channel (P-MOS) and complementary (CMOS) types. The concluding portion presents a summary chart comparing the major parameters of the various IC digital families discussed in the three installments, plus a useful check list of available functions."
"Although most literature concerning world population growth and allied problems has been written for a wide spectrum of readers, the present article provides data related to population growth, energy consumption, and life-support capabilities in a format designed specifically to satisfy the technologist. Momentous technical advances have occurred during the last century, but it has become evident that concomitant penalties are beginning to appear. If such a rate of technical growth continues into the future, social systems will become more and more complex, with an increasing probability of malfunction unless closer attention is given to the possible penalties associated with such advances. Since industrialization problems in a highly populated world are difficult, if not impossible, to predict, the intent of this article is to emphasize the need for engineers and scientists to become aware of the importance of their work, and to stimulate thought regarding the relationship between technology and the ultimate quality of life."

"In a pilot program of cooperative innovation in engineering education between Dartmouth College and Tuskegee Institute, several Dartmouth undergraduates, while resident at Tuskegee, taught and coached freshman engineers at the Institute in the fundamentals of engineering. The Dartmouth student-coaches also took courses in pursuit of their own degrees. Results of the program are presented and Tuskegee Institute student responses are assayed. Goals and future plans and their implementation are discussed."
"A number of the largest utility companies are embarking upon large-scale nuclear generating plant construction programs that may phase out up to 50 percent of their fossil-fuel stations by the end of the present decade. This move is being encouraged by the electrical suppliers, who, with the utilities and the AEC, are striving to convince a skeptical public that nuclear stations are completely safe and provide the best means for air-pollution abatement. Nevertheless, many fossil-fuel plants are still being planned and built, and more efficient methods of reducing stack gas emissions will have to be incorporated at these facilities if a general reduction in air-pollution levels is to be achieved while simultaneously meeting the accelerating demand for more electric energy. Government, too, has a role to play and a responsibility to fulfill in the public interest by enacting fair and practicable pollution-control legislation, and ensuring the enforcement of such statutes."

In this article, proposals that are likely to be considered by such a company are discussed and their preparation and evaluation described."
"Pulsars are celestial objects that emit brief, intense bursts of energy, principally, but not exclusively, at radio frequencies. Several pulsars ``tick'' at time intervals whose precision exceeds that of quartz crystal clocks and approaches that of atomic time standards. The announcement of the discovery of the first four pulsars, early in 1968, triggered an unparalleled competitive frenzy among radio astronomers to find additional pulsars. By last fall, some 100 of these precisely periodic radio sources had been discovered, theories about what they might be had proliferated and been laid to rest almost as rapidly, and many important new facts about several of them had been elucidated."
"One definition of integrated electronics can be given as ``the physical realization of a number of circuit elements inseparably associated on or within a continuous body to perform the function of a circuit.'' This definition gives only an indirect clue to the reasons for the tremendous impact of integrated electronics upon the electronics field in particular, and upon technological aids to society in general. This article attempts to explore these reasons and to discuss some of the consequences of the growth of this advanced technology. It complements J. J. Suran's January article, ``A Perspective on Integrated Electronics,'' which explores the problems in design theory that have resulted from the extreme complexity of IC fabrication."

"Ferroelectric ceramics are piezoelectric and optically birefringent. Moreover, their coefficients of piezoelectricity and birefringence are electrically variable. Consequently, these ceramics are applicable to a variety of devices: electrically tuned oscillators and transformers; miniaturized high-Q, high-frequency filters; FM discriminators; optical memories; electrically Controlled light shutters and valves; and electrically activated multicolor displays. This article deals with some possibilities for devices that exploit the electrically controllable optical effects. A later article will consider piezoelectric applications."
"Despite the rapid advances in many regions of data transmission, there is a rapidly growing number of applications for which existing data-transmission techniques are inefficient. A look at the status of data-transmission development indicates that, although a very successful campaign has been waged to map the data waveform into a waveform ideally suited for transmission on the communication channel, very little has been done to match the often discontinuous flow of data from the terminal to the continuous flow of information in the channel. Combining randomly occurring messages from several sources into a more continuous flow is described by the mathematics of traffic theory. Although this theory has been extensively applied to speech traffic, it is rarely applied to data traffic. As a specific example of the gains in channel efficiency that can be had through the application of traffic theory, the multiplexer-concentrator is examined. In the author's opinion, it is in this area of application of traffic theory to data communication that many of the more significant future developments in data transmission will be made. To be sure, some work has been done, but it is relatively little when the gains that can be made are considered."
"This article examines some nontechnical factors that will influence both policy and technical decisions regarding operational space-television broadcasting. The reasons for using space broadcast for both community and general public services are examined. They include faster introduction of service in new areas, potentially lower cost, extension of program choice, and more efficient use of frequencies. These are considered with respect to the state of economic development and availability of existing service. Marked differences are found between developing and developed areas. It appears that developing areas could best initiate television service with a community satellite, whereas developed areas could best use the satellite for program equalization. For both areas, a combined system of both terrestrial stations and satellites appears to be the most cost-effective. Possibilities for spectrum conservation are considered along with areas needing further study."
"This article offers a simple graphic construction that shows the variation of current and voltage along an electric line for a steady sinusoidal operation. The method complements the use of formula applications and the Smith chart, thus making for a good and easy understanding of transmission-line operation."

 "Ballistic-missile defense has been continuously researched in the United States for the past 14 years. The Safeguard system itself is an outgrowth of both the Nike-Zeus system and later ballistic-missile components developed by various government agencies. The classic result of this early work was clear-an ICBM could be intercepted by another missile. Hence, the real controversy concerning the workability of such systems centered around an entirely different problem-the ``high-traffic environment''-or how to make tens to hundreds of near-simultaneous intercepts while tracking thousands of targets. This article describes the radars that have led to a solution of this problem, and how such radars operate within the framework of the world's most sophisticated defense system."
"The means for providing underground transmission of large quantities of electric power at a reduction in present-day cost by at least an order of magnitude ranks among the high imperatives of today's research efforts. Demand for the expansion of ``undergrounding'' is soundly based upon such factors as the rapid growth of cities, the doubling of power requirements with every passing decade, and esthetic objections to the appearance of overhead lines. Unfortunately, at the present time, such expansion is possible only at excessive cost. The authors present the problem as it exists within the United States, and offer solutions that are commensurate with the state of the art."
"Low-power-drain VHF amplifiers have some unique characteristics when they are miniaturized. And, if the design is special-requiring tight tolerances or intended for limited-quantity production-it is often desirable to make the RF micropower circuits from discrete components. Described in this article are the first-order device requirements and circuit considerations for such VHF amplifiers incorporating bipolar transistors operating at collector currents as low as 25 μA. Two specific designs are offered, along with information pertinent to their construction."
"Within the walls of the Burndy Library, one has access to 30 000 printed volumes, and, in addition, rare manuscripts, correspondence, and laboratory notes written over the centuries by many of the world's greatest scientists, engineers, inventors, physicians, and philosophers. More than 300 of the science ``incunabula'' (books published in the first 45 years of printing, 1455-1500) are included in this collection. The Library also doubles as a museum, since it contains in its special display cases numerous examples of early optical and electrical instruments and devices, and laboratory equipment used by the great scientists of a bygone era. Authentic electrostatic generators, made between 1740 and the mid-1800s, are a prominent feature of the permanent exhibit. Portraits and sculptures of noted practitioners in science and technology add to the warmth and dramatic aura of the building and its priceless contents."

With these advances, one can anticipate a rapid increase in the utilization of Schottky barriers, not only as discrete devices but also as a new component in integrated circuits. This article presents a unified picture that quantitatively characterizes both the Schottky barrier and ohmic contacts on silicon. Fabrication techniques and various applications are also discussed."

 "Voltage regulation has been a specialty of semiconductors since the introduction of the Zener diode well over a decade ago. Now, there is a new dimension to the field-the monolithic voltage regulator. Available in a number of configurations that have specific advantages ranging over a variety of applications, this new component not only is giving its discrete counterpart a run for the money, but is showing a potential that easily surpasses even the most optimistic of earlier predictions."
"To supply the mounting demand for electricity in the Federal Republic of Germany, a network has been built that consists of 380- and 220-kV multiple bundles. Multitiered towers are used to support the conductors because available land is a limited, expensive commodity. As far back as the 1920s, 220kV, in the scope of an emerging interconnected system, became a necessity for covering great distances. Then followed the 380-kV lines in the 1950s-the first line section being energized in 1957."
"Blanket agreements between employers and employees, requiring the latter to relinquish in advance any claims to any ideas springing up during the term of employment, are considered illegal and against public policy in most highly industrialized countries-with the notable exceptions of the United States and Great Britain. In the author's opinion, these agreements are eminently unfair to the creative individual; moreover, since they tend to discourage innovation, they have a broad crippling effect on a nation's technological advancement."
"We are all aware that radio communication is not instantaneous. With the coming of satellite communication we have fallen prey to some of the consequences of telephony with long propagation time. So it is that when one person speaks to another via satellite link, he must wait perhaps 600 ms for a rejoinder. Such a delay, of itself, may not be too disconcerting, but in combination with echo it can contribute to poorer quality transmission. This is an account of how echo is produced, how it can affect a telephone conversation, and what steps are being taken to overcome the problems."
"The defense electronics industry is again faced with the prospect of cutbacks, which brings the problem of its conversion once more to the fore. At the same time, the growth of imports presages sharp competition for U.S. industry for the products it can devise to take up the slack. Further, the electronics industry has a quality problem, in its military, industrial, and consumer sectors. In this article, the writer suggests that the industry's displaced technical talent should be organized to tackle systematically its scientific, engineering, and economic problems in order to put it ahead once more. As a vehicle of change, he proposes a National Technology Foundation to oversee the program and to undertake tasks now beyond the scope of individual companies."

"Ferroelectric ceramics exhibit piezoelectric effects and optical birefringence that are electrically controllable. Consequently, these ceramics are applicable to a wide variety of devices. An article in the February issue has already described electrically actuated light valves and electrically controlled optical filters. The present article deals with the piezoelectric behavior of ferroelectric ceramics. Since, macroscopically, these materials are nearly isotropic, a discussion of their piezoelectric behavior can provide uncluttered-and surprising-insight into the theory of piezoelectric energy conversion."
"The first four articles in this series traced the scientific developments underlying the earliest tentative attempts to exploit the new results of electromagnetic theory for practical purposes. Almost to a man, the main contributors to these developments were connected with one academic establishment or another. Only one was not: an amateur who became the first entrepreneur of the new technology, young Marconi - newly arrived in London from his native Italy in February 1896, not quite 22 years old, and determined to make his fortune in the city that was not only the capital of the most powerful and richest maritime nation in the world but also the headquarters of a far-flung empire. The electronics industry got its start with attempts to bridge bodies of water radiotelegraphically, culminating in the spanning of the Atlantic by Marconi in 1901. The fifth installment of our continuing series shows how the young industry was bedeviled by priority arguments and litigation."

  "More than a dozen schemes for sending visual images by electricity appeared from 1877 to 1884. Some used multiwire lines and mosaic arrays; others used single lines and a scanning method-autographic, spiral, linear. Selenium cells and incandescent filaments were common elements. Basic ideas on scanning speed, repetition frequency, synchronism, picture elements, and beam modulation evolved during these years. Some schemes employed magnetooptic effects, others used polarized light, and an optical equivalent of the cathode-ray tube was proposed for one receiver. Mechanical problems were finally solved by the scanning disk, which, 40 years later, with the aid of electronic techniques, became the foundation for practical mechanical television. Both facsimile and television proposals were covered, partly because they were inseparable during this era and partly to show the continuity of developments."
"Preliminary testing and extrapolations thereof indicate that liquid-metal MHD can be used as a topping cycle to increase the efficiency of large central-station power plants. Because maximum temperatures as low as 870° C are effective, such binary plants are possible with existing material technology. The best present choices appear to be a potassium working fluid and either a (helium-or sodium-cooled) nuclear reactor or a fossil-fueled furnace. Cost estimates for a possible plant with 1-GW output-based on the use of a coal-fired furnace operating at 870°C with a condensing type of MHD cycle-suggest that, for a capital-cost outlay approximately equal to that for a conventional coal-fired plant, 13 percent more efficiency is achieved by the plant with the topping cycle."
"The lack of understanding, analyzing, and communicating technological ``uncertainties'' are presented by the author as seriously undermining the effectiveness of decision-making in both public affairs and industry. Uncertainties are as important to truth as certainties and should be part of all forms of technical communication. ``Technical truth,'' it is pointed out, is not developed in the legal process of adversary confrontation. On the other hand, ``adversary truth,'' as presented by the contestants, is only part of the truth, for it excludes uncertainties, which are left to the perspicacity of the audience. In the well-publicized ABM controversy, the technical atmosphere had degenerated into that of an adversary confrontation, and technical truth with its uncertainties could not emerge. This basic and typical deficiency of the ABM controversy is not limited to public affairs: it exists strongly in industry and takes its toll in reducing the quality of decision-making in inefficient operations and in unnecessary crises, all carrying a burden of cost. It appears that the damaging effects of inattention to technical uncertainties could be radically reduced under a carefully worked out and nurtured environment."
"Not very long ago the concept of large-scale integration was just that-a concept. But since that time most of the more difficult technological problems have been resolved and many others are well on their way to solution. The important potential advantages of LSI-reduced cost, improved reliability, size and weight reductions, and computerized fabrication-served to provide the impetus for their rapid development. Focusing on the digital correlator as an example, this article describes the techniques and problems involved both in the basic design and in the fabrication processes."

"About four years ago, the consensus among network theorists was that active synthesis was headed nowhere because of high sensitivities. At that time, active filters had a well-deserved reputation among design engineers for poor stability. Practical active filters were plagued with self-oscillations, nonadjustability, nonreproducibility, and high thermal coefficients. Active network theory could accomplish nothing except explain the poor results. Since then, however, the picture has changed from total gloom to overjoyed optimism. The sensitivity problem now has several solutions, and active filters are more stable than passive filters, at least in some cases."
"Although solid fuels still remain a dominant energy source for generating electricity throughout the world (taken as a whole), the overall fuel-energy supply picture has changed dramatically in the last 45 years. In 1925, coal was the overwhelming source of caloric content; today it ranks second to oil. Four decades ago-and until World War II-the United States was a significant net exporter of energy supplies. Today the role of major supplier falls on the Middle East and Africa-and together they provide more than half of the world's fuel energy. Reported are details of the various energy supply sources by type and origin."
"This article describes a novel, large-scale instructional television system now in operation at Stanford University, under the auspices of the School of Engineering. The network brings the campus classroom and instructor to graduate students employed by participating organizations at inconvenient distances from the school, and talk-back capability is included to provide a live classroom situation. No detailed analysis of the system's benefits has yet been made but, after approximately a year of operation, all informal reaction has been favorable."

 "The ever-increasing volume of aircraft operations of all types (commercial, private, and military) is taxing present terminal and en route control systems and equipment-and air-traffic controllers-to the outer limits of their respective handling capacities and endurance. Thus the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been obliged to formulate detailed plans to meet the challenge of phenomenal aviation growth forecast for the decade of the '70s, and beyond. For the initial ten-year time slot, the FAA has proposed many system improvements that could be provided by annual appropriations of $250 million for facilities and equipment, and $60 million for R&D. For example, en route and air-terminal automation expanded radar service and coverage, increased federal assistance to airports, and improved navigation and landing aids are some elements now in the planning stage to ensure greater airborne safety, to increase traffic-handling capabilities, and to promote more efficient service for the air passenger. This first installment deals with the ground-control systems that will eventually form an integrated and automated network in the 48 contiguous states of the U.S."
"Among the ``city-states'' in the Federal Republic of Germany, the plight of Hamburg-with respect to its electrical needs-is, if not typical, then representative of conditions that exist in other cities in the republic. To meet the growing electric needs of the populace, a Hamburg electric utility has devised a system that will take full advantage of existing services incorporated into a new ``broader backbone.'' Plans call for sufficient redundancy to permit operation at all levels with a minimum of downtime. At no time will interruption last more than one hour; most often it will amount to only minutes or seconds. As the need arises, the system will grow and grow-hopefully not outstripping its potential until the turn of the century."
"Between 1948-when Shannon first proposed his basic theorems on information theory-and the start of the space age, little practical application developed from the lessons of coding theory. This article presents an overview of the Shannon theorem, interesting practical codes, and their application to the space channel. It turns out that a simple encoder in combination with a decoder of modest complexity placed into an uncoded communications system can increase the data rate by a factor of four or more depending on the coding scheme and the allowable error rate. Use of a convolutional code with sequential decoding has proved to be the outstanding scheme for these applications. It appears that, in the future, coding will find a place in most new digital space communication systems."

"Observers have found that the ``learning-curve'' phenomenon occurs in many complex situations and is not confined to the human learning of repetitive manual skills. If experience improves performance, it should follow that the company that has produced the most widgets will be the most efficient widget producer. This implies that market share is vital in determining potential profitability and that new products, whether developed internally or acquired outside, are doomed to lackluster financial performance unless they capture a dominant market position. The learning-curve effect and its more generalized experience-curve companions are reviewed in this article. Some typical cost and price experience curves are discussed along with the technical details of their derivation. The possible inferences that can be drawn from the observed facts are examined and tested for their qualitative agreement with certain known trends and tendencies."
"At the present time, dc power supplies generally are not designed to maintain continuous and steady voltages during momentary disturbances in their ac power-transmission-supply line. Yet, during lightning storms, or through some line fault, electrical disturbances can occur within transmission lines that tend to depress dc power-supply voltages. There are methods for desensitizing the dc power supplies to these ac disturbances. One way-if the power supply does not make use of SCRs-is to use larger capacitors in the rectifier circuit. In any event, and especially if SCRs are used, the best method for sustaining dc output power is to use an auxiliary energy-reservoir circuit."

In many parts of the U.S. these plants are competitive with plants burning coal, but the electricity that they generate will be more costly in the future as uranium supplies deplete. A promising possible answer to the cost problem is the fast-neutron reactor, which produces more fuel than it consumes. Such a plant should also be a more efficient generator of electricity and this should produce less thermal pollution than a water-reactor plant. However, it takes time to breed the fuel to make these fast reactors possible, and until more is known about the performance of such reactors, final judgment about their economic feasibility must continue to be held in abeyance."
"The generosity that characterized research grants in the 1950s and 1960s is apparently at an end. Not only have the purse strings on scientific monies been tightened, but the economic climate and the general nature of scientific spending have eroded the value of the monies received. The scientific community is therefore faced with the problem of how best to allocate the funds that it does get. And although this community can't make policy regarding these allocations, it can help shape it. No effort is made in this discourse to state the specific steps to be taken-only to suggest the alternatives that are open and to stimulate the reader into accepting what is, inevitably, one of the important tasks to be faced in the 1970s."
"In this three-part survey article, some of the demands that traditionally have been made upon switchgear-and how these demands are being met-are described. Part I covers the basic problems associated with current interruptions, arc phenomenons, arc mediums, and testing. In Part II, to be published in August, some of the more general design aspects will be discussed. Part III will treat specialized problems connected with the conception of certain physical principles of current interruption."
"Digital logic circuits are now available and are being used with delay times that are comparable to the delays of interconnections used in packaging these circuits. At high speeds, however, such interconnections no longer behave as simple short circuits, but take on the appearance of transmission lines. Unless transmission lines are terminated properly, ``reflections'' can develop that might be of sufficient magnitude to produce false logic levels or exceed maximum circuit voltage specifications. One may choose to solve the problem by increasing the density of the system. This, however, introduces the problem of ``crosstalk.'' The present article describes several analytical techniques for predicting the kinds of reflections and crosstalk that are typically seen in digital systems, thus enabling the engineer to determine in advance whether or not such ``interconnection noise'' will result, how bad it will be, and what the typical interconnection limitations are for circuits of various speeds."
"The engineer as a political person is considered in this address presented by M. Ponte, representing the Institut de France (Academie des Sciences), at the second general meeting of the World Federation of Engineering Organizations at UNESCO, Paris, France. Dr. Ponte is a former vice president of the Institute of Radio Engineers."

"This discussion is directed to least-squares estimation theory, from its inception by Gauss1 to its modern form, as developed by Kalman.2 To aid in furnishing the desired perspective, the contributions and insights provided by Gauss are described and related to developments that have appeared more recently (that is, in the 20th century). In the author's opinion, it is enlightening to consider just how far (or how little) we have advanced since the initial developments and to recognize the truth in the saying that we ``stand on the shoulders of giants.''"
"Last February, the U.S. Congress authorized the FAA to spend initially $2.5 billion for the improvement of ATC equipment. This sum reportedly includes $1.7 billion for new electronic systems. The appropriation is part of a $5 billion trust fund package for airways and airport development that is now being hammered out by a joint Senate and House conference committee. A large percentage of the total appropriation will be expended on additional en route ATC sectors, terminal area automation, en route navigational systems, and improved UHF and VHF communications channels. In addition, collision-avoidance systems (CAS), instrument-landing systems (ILS), and automatic weather-sensing equipment will either be further developed or installed. The first installment of this three-part series dealt primarily with the functions of the ARTS installations and the Common IFR Room in the New York terminal area. In this piece, we will examine other systems and aspects of the FAA's plans for the present decade."

 "Since their invention early in the 20th century, filters have played an important role in electronic technology. However, the LC filter, which had been the type most widely used in the past, is now being phased out because of the change in design criterions imposed by the current trend toward microminiaturization. The problem of finding a replacement may be solved by implementing some of the inductorless filter methods described in this two-part article. Part I discusses the two basic groups of electromechanical filters-the monolithic crystal and ceramic types, and the mechanical filter, which is coupled with a transducer. Part II of this article, to appear next month, will consider linear active and digital devices."
"The purpose of this report is to give the reader, by means of specific application examples, an overview of the extreme versatility of the minicomputer. The basic system configurations that will be described may be adapted, by analogy, to many other tasks. In this manner we hope to stimulate the reader to think about ways in which a minicomputer might be able to do a job for him at less cost, in less time, in a more thorough manner, or more reliably than that job could be done-if it could be done at all-without the minicomputer. It is beyond the intended scope of this report to discuss minicomputer architecture, to describe in detail commercially available minicomputers, or to attempt to offer detailed guidelines for the selection of a specific minicomputer model for a system."
"An exponential proliferation of technology imposes serious burdens upon society. Consequently, the engineering community will be forced to deliberate more than it has in the past about the social consequences of its acts. In this way, the best interests of both the engineer and society will be served."
"An important aid in the analysis and display of speech is the sound spectrogram, which represents a time-frequency-intensity display of the short-time spectrum.1-3 With many modern speech facilities centering around small or medium-size computers, it is often useful to generate spectrograms digitally, online. The fast Fourier transform algorithm provides a mechanism for implementing this efficiently."

"In practically every type of research program in the physical sciences as well as in sophisticated engineering analyses, very small electrical signals must be measured and, in general, the limit of attainable precision and detectability is set by noise. This is true for the physicist and chemist performing nuclear magnetic resonance or spectroscopy experiments, for medical and biological researchers interested in evoked potentials, for geologists measuring small remanent magnetic fields in rock samples, for the metallurgist making Fermi surface measurements, and for the engineer performing vibration analysis and sensitive bridge measurements. These are only a few examples of applications in which noise plays a critical role in limiting measurement precision and signal detectability. This article discusses some of the inherent problems and describes techniques for improving signal-to-noise ratio."
"Control of air traffic from the ground is only half the story-the airborne electronic equipment, displays, instrumentation, and human response are necessary to complete the loop in any practicable system. A few versions of collision-avoidance systems are entirely under airborne control. Based upon experience, pilots are wary of the hazards at certain major airports; in approaching other terminals, however, they have a sense of confidence that is inspired by the existence of the latest ATC equipment and facilities that afford a high degree of safety to pilots, passengers, and aircraft."
"This second installment of a three-part article focuses on circuit-breaker characteristics of general importance, independent of the arc medium chosen. A systematic, though necessarily incomplete, schedule of decisions to be made in the course of the development of one new breaker type will show the complexity of the problems involved."

 "In electronic video recording (EVR),† the color television signals are recorded on a special 8.75-mm-wide, high-resolution photographic film, with two frames side by side. One frame contains luminance information; the other, coded chrominance information. Sound is recorded on two magnetic edge stripes. An 18-cm-diameter cartridge can play 25 minutes of color programming or twice that duration of black-and-white programming. Described in this article are the processes that, starting from an original program on video tape, produce a reproduction with excellent fidelity upon playback. A detailed explanation is provided of the mechanical, optical, and electronic arrangements-including the transcoding of the chrominance signal into a conventional color television signal."
"Not in recent times has so much of the engineering force been on the unemployment rolls. Job seeking is never easy, and for many engineers the experience may be novel. This article covers the steps that the engineer job seeker should follow initially, and cites some of the dos and don'ts to help him sell himself."
"Although a large amount of work in optical transmission has been accomplished through the use of lasers, modern developments have enabled noncoherent light sources also to be used in this area with great success. In particular, injection light sources-in the form of the coherent injection laser and the noncoherent light-emitting diode (LED)-offer designers of optical transmission systems characteristics that are in many ways superior to those of other methods. The present article deals essentially with how injection light sources may be employed to transmit or ``communicate'' information optically. Such optical techniques can be used not only in communication systems, in the classic RF sense, but in computer, video, telemetry, and detection systems as well."
"Measuring resistance, performing a coulometric titration, measuring semiconductor breakdown voltages, operating IMPATT diodes, testing electrolytic capacitors, measuring magnetic field intensity-these represent only a few of the applications of constant-current sources. Some of the features of constant-current supplies, as well as the requirements imposed on these sources and techniques for using them in a variety of applications, are described in this article."

"In this two-part survey the author has attempted to review the main methods of inductorless filter design being pursued at the present time. These filters are of particular interest because they may provide the replacement for the LC filters that are being eliminated from electronic equipment as a result of the trend toward microminiaturization. This month's installment discusses inductorless filters of both the linear active and digital types."
"The preceding five articles in this series described how advances in electromagnetic theory, one of the two parent sciences of today's electronics technology, led to its first successes at the turn of the century: \"wireless\" communications. But radiotelegraphy may well have remained an expensive and uncertain medium, restricted to emergency use in situations in which costs did not matter, if discoveries in the other parent science-particle physics-had not most conveniently come along at about the same time and opened up undreamed-of possibilities in the generation of high-frequency waves and the amplification of weak signals. The invention of the first thermionic devices, which led to the massive development of electronic telecommunications in the 20th century, was predicated on a discovery made in a British university laboratory as the 19th century drew to its close."
"The problems treated in last month's discussion are essentially independent of the type of breaker, although their relative importance may vary. More specialized problems connected with the conception of certain physical principles of current interruption-mainly the arc medium-are described in this final installment."

 "If it became necessary to locate a large, high-technology defense facility in X location, where would the technical professional work force be obtained? Attempts to answer this question, posed by the Assistant Director of Defense Research and Engineering (Engineering Management) to a Stanford Research Institute team, opened a Pandora's box. Data collected in pursuit of the answer enabled the team to develop several inferences bearing upon the movement of this technical, intellectual resource between geographical areas and between employers. After describing briefly the source and processing of the data, this article describes the team's findings concerning intergeographical and interemployer movement of technical professionals, in that order."
"In this article the two-port characteristics, the gain stability, and the sensitivity of the nonideal operational amplifier are presented. A unified approach is taken to cover both the inverting and the noninverting modes of amplifier operation. Some of the sensitivity aspects pertaining to network synthesis using operational amplifiers are also discussed."

"The ground-fault interrupter is the most successful device for eliminating the hazard from low-voltage electric shocks in the home, on the farm, and in industry. It is the newest of four recognized means-isolation, insulation, grounding, and shock interruption-for reducing the danger from electric shock and it is, by far, the most radical."

"Integrated-circuit technology may be expected to bring the price of complex electronic equipment within the sphere of industrial and consumer markets and, at the same time, make possible the development and use of significantly more powerful equipment, such as large computers, for military, government, and industrial applications.

"Because countries are proud of their traditions, heritage, and accomplishments and want the rest of the world to know about them, they find it useful and convenient to disseminate such information on tiny testaments called postage stamps. The philatelic approach to recording history is studded with acknowledgements of the electrical and electronic accomplishments and includes events dating back to the early 17th century. Although the number of stamps commemorating such events is far too numerous to describe adequately in this article, some of the more noteworthy events and inventors are described with reference to their appearance on postal engravings."

   "Four functions of the maximum likelihood estimates of the Weibull shape parameter and any Weibull percentile are found. The sampling distributions are independent of the population parameters and depend only upon sample size and the degree of (Type II) censoring. These distributions, once determined by Monte Carlo methods, permit the testing of the following hypotheses: 1) that the Weibull shape parameter is equal to a specified value; 2) that a Weibull percentile is equal to a specified value; 3) that the shape parameters of two Weibull populations are equal; and 4) that a specified percentile of two Weibull populations are equal given that the shape parameters are. The OC curves of the various tests are shown to be readily computed. A by-product of the determination of the distribution of the four functions are the factors required for median unbiased estimation of 1) the Weibull shape parameter, 2) a Weibull percentile, 3) the ratio of shape parameters of two Weibull distributions, and 4) the ratio of a specified percentile of two Weibull distributions."
"A problem which can be quite costly to an agency involved with repairable equipment on a large scale is the misclassification which can arise when repair work is initiated. Often, a piece of equipment finds its way to the repair shop even though it has not experienced a failure. On the other hand, a failed component may not be repaired properly because the cause of failure is not properly diagnosed; thus a delay will occur in returning the component to service. A mathematical model is developed which accounts for the two misclassification possibilities and a procedure is given which minimizes the misclassification probabilities, contingent on a fixed amount of available capital for this purpose. The model is of the Markov type with the simplifying assumption of constant transition rates (over time) among the various states."
"A Bayesian estimate of reliability for the exponential case is developed which utilizes the basic notion of loss in estimation theory. Since the loss associated with overestimation is usually greater than the loss associated with underestimation of reliability, the loss function can be a useful tool. The loss function and prior distribution of reliability presented are sufficiently flexible to be compatible with many situations in which reliability estimates are require. When no prior information is at hand and a symmetric loss is used, the resulting estimate is seen to be the minimum variance unbiased estimate of reliability. This agreement gives some credibility to the precision of the estimation approach."
"The performance of systems subject to failure and repair cycles can be described by a variety of stochastic processes. Downtime is a measure of system worth which is commonly found in the reliability literature. Another measure, excess time, has been proposed in a recent paper. Both downtime and excess time are measures of the accumulated time during which the system has been inoperative. The parameter t of excess time counts only productive units of time. Thus B(t) is the excess of unproductive time over productive time. The properties and applications of excess time are reviewed and summarized."
"A flow graph approach for reliability analysis is applied to redundancy with elements in the simple series-parallel networks and to the more general case with elements in non-series-parallel combinations. The reliability of networks for elements with open or short failures is analyzed with flow graphs. Typical examples are shown."
"Expressions are given in the literature for the availability, mean-time-between-failures, mean uptime, and mean downtime for systems consisting of a number of identical modules in redundancy. Using the concept of superstates, vector expressions for these parameters are presented which apply to a system consisting of an arbitrary interconnection of different types of modules. A vector expression for system effectiveness is presented which is formally the same as the expression for availability in the case of a single-function system and which can be extended easily to cover multifunction systems."
"The times to failure of Au thermocompression bonds to Au-Mo-Al and to Au-Ti-Al multilayer films were determined as a function of temperature over the range of 125-400°C and compared with the time to failure of gold bonds to aluminum films. A 500-Å Ti intermediate film was found to be ineffective as a barrier to reaction between gold and aluminum. On the other hand, a 500-Å Mo film was effective, providing increased time to failure over that observed for bonds to Au-Ti-Al and Al films. No failures were observed after 2000 hours at 400°C when gold wire bonds were made to an Au/Mo/Al metallization having 1000 Å of molybdenum as the intermediate layer."
"A method is introduced for approximating the reliability of a large complex system with standby components. It is done by substituting an approximate simple model for the more complex system. Each part of the model has a simple formula for its reliability."
"A reliability concept is considered in which telephone traffic is taken into account for a telephone network. An analytic model of a simple network with parallel paths shows how telephone traffic is included in the telephone network reliability analysis. Examples are given to demonstrate the usefulness of this concept in the investigation of an optimum inspection policy for each path, and the effects of path age and failure rate on telephone network service."

"Consider a multicomponent system consisting of two series subsystems. One contains identical components connected in parallel, while the other has nonalike components connected in series. Each component has constant hazard rate, while the subsequent repairs follow some general distributions. The supplementary variable technique developed by Kielson and Kooharian [1] and the phase technique are used to obtain the various time-dependent and steady-state solutions for the system. A numerical illustration compares the effect of two repair policies on the behavior of the system. The optimum number of components connected in parallel is obtained."
"A new analytical technique is presented for evaluating the steady-state performance of large repairable systems which cannot be described in terms of series-parallel subsystems. The method, which is based on a novel combinatorial algorithm, is used to calculate the frequency of failures and expected failure durations at each node in networks of repairable devices. The networks may have multiple input and output nodes, but the uptimes and downtimes of the devices in the network are assumed to be exponentially distributed and independent. To demonstrate the usefulness of the technique for large-scale networks of general configuration, the solution of a sample problem using a pilot computer program is also included."
"A computer program, which provides bounds for system reliability, is described. The algorithms are based on the concepts of success paths and cut sets. A listing of the elements in the system, their predecessors, and the probability of successful operation of each element are the inputs. The outputs are the success paths, the cut sets, and a series of upper and lower reliability bounds; these bounds converge to the reliability which would be calculated if all the terms in the model were evaluated. The algorithm for determining the cuts from the success paths is based on Boolean logic and is relatively simple to understand. Two examples are described, one of which is very simple and the computation can be done by hand, and a second for which there are 55 success paths and 10 cuts and thus machine computation is desirable."
"Failure rate is the most commonly used term in reliability and related engineering interests, yet it is still not well understood by perhaps the majority of those using it. Indeed, more than one reliability treatise wrongly defines failure rate as a conditional probability density, i.e., wrong by the accepted criterion of what constitutes any probability density. The fact that these two concepts are by no means the same is clarified and made more precise. Mean time between failures and dimensionality are also briefly considered."
"Unreliable or intermittent electrical connections are considered. A stochastic model for unreliable connections is described. The application of the Wiener-Hopf theory to the reconstruction of a randomly intermittent signal leads to the design of an optimum filter which minimizes the mean-square reconstruction error."
"The reliability and mean-life equations for three types of redundant systems are derived and discussed. The components used in each system are assumed to be identical with a hazard rate equal to γt (a wearout characteristic), and repair is not considered. Curves comparing the system mean life and reliability for the three types of systems are presented."
"Some electrical and physical characteristics of integrated circuits with passivation by low-temperature vapor deposition of glass were studied. It was found that 1) passivated devices have more resistance to aluminum corrosion than nonpassivated devices, 2) during temperature cycling the glass on the top of the aluminum inhibits the formation of hillocks, and 3) passivated devices offer more protection from mechanical abrasions and foreign materials. Some electrical parameters of transistors as well as integrated circuits were measured before and after passivation; no significant differences were found. No degradation on these parameters was found after a 1000-hour operating life test on passivated and nonpassivated units."
"Many practicing engineers model their systems using reliability diagrams, while others use fault-tree analysis. The theoretical equivalence of the two techniques is described. System reliability can be expressed in two ways: probability of success and probability of failure approach, in terms of the tie-sets (forward paths) of a reliability diagram. Similarly, one can write two other expressions in terms of the cut-sets of the system reliability diagram. If one uses the fault-tree analysis approach, the probability of failure is written in terms of element failures by applying the rules of symbolic logic (union and intersection). This equation is identical with the tie-set probability of failure equation. Also by applying DeMorgan's logic theorem to the fault-tree probability of the failure equation, one obtains the tie-set probability of success equation. Thus the two techniques are shown to be identical. The choice between the techniques is a matter of convenience and familiarity."
"An example is given in which the use of attributes data is preferable to the use of variables data."
"The uniform prior distribution is a mathematically acceptable prior distribution for reliability R(t) = exp (-λt). Certain other considerations, however, lead to the conclusion that the uniform prior distribution on R(t) should be used with extreme caution."

  "This paper lays the ground work for the statistical determination of the reliability of protective relay systems found in electric power systems. The reliability problem has two conflicting requirements: 1) failure to operate in the presence of a fault and 2) unnecessary operation when a fault occurs that the relay or relay system was set to ignore. It is not often treated in reliability literature."
"Random failure is perhaps the most abused term in reliability and related engineering interests. Past definitions, being logically more descriptive than constructive, have not been truly definitive. An attempt is made here to offer one that is: the class of failures statistically independent of past history. This definition is based upon the mutual implication between the stochastic processes producing such events and the unique characterization thereof by their independence."
"Data are presented comparing 1-percent MgAI wire with 1-percent SiAI wire for ultrasonically bonded interconnects on semiconductor devices. The effects of annealing time and temperature on the strength of the wire demonstrate the mechanical superiority of the 1-percent MgAI wire. The effects of ultrasonic power and time on wire deformation and bond pull strength demonstrate similar behavior for both the 1-percent MgAI wire and the 1-percent SiAI wire. It is also shown that there is a critical amount of wire deformation necessary for a strong bond, and that further deformation weakens the interconnection. Although there are very few data on the effects of Mg in Si, there have been fragmentary reports that 1-percent MgAI wire causes degradation of transistor characteristics. This investigation indicates that 1-percent MgAI wire is not the dominant degradation mechanism in any device studied."
"In a complex system where the redundant units cannot be reduced to a purely parallel or series configuration, the reliability is obtained by using Bayes' theorem. A mathematical model is formulated for the reliability of a system with nonlinear constraints. The system reliability is optimized based on the model and the solution is obtained by using the sequential unconstrained minimization technique (SUMT). This method is an efficient method for solving this type of problem. Two life support systems, one is the communication system of a two-man space capsule and another is a high-pressure oxygen supply system in a space capsule, have been identified to have the complex system configuration treated in this work."
"Hydrogen gas, the foaming agent in RTV-5370 silicone foam encapsulating plastic, caused resistance increases in thin-film Evanohm resistors. The hydrogen is a byproduct of the polymerization of hydrosiloxane groups with polymeric hydroxy functional siloxanes. The hydrogen gas is produced over an extended time period and trapped in the sealed circuit box. The gas then diffuses through the silicone resin coating and protective vinyl shrink tubing surrounding the metal film, with a rate that increases with pressure and temperature. The polymerization reaction of the foam can be driven to completion by heating in air at 100° C for 24 hours. Out-diffusion of the hydrogen gas from the affected resistors will occur on heating in air at 100° C for 48 hours or more. By fitting analytic solutions of the diffusion equation to the observed in- and out-diffusion data, the diffusion coefficient for the encapsulant surrounding the resistor film was found to be D = 3 x 10-4 exp (-0.28 eV/kT) cm2/s. The resistance increase is caused by the high solubility of hydrogen in nickel. The hydrogen increases the residual resistivity but not the thermal coefficient of resistance (TCR) of the film. The sensitivity of nickel-containing resistor materials, such as Evanohm or Nichrome, to hydrogen suggests that hydrogen-producing encapsulants should not be used with nonhermetic devices and that no hydrogen should be included in the protective atmosphere of hermetically sealed devices."
"This expository paper discusses four two-unit redundant systems: 1) parallel redundancy; 2) standby redundancy; 3) standby redundancy with priority; 4) standby redundancy with noninstantaneous switchover. In models 1), 2), and 3) the switchover time is instantaneous. The integral equation of renewal theory is applied by using the concept of a cycle. Applying the integral equation of renewal theory and the cycle, we obtain systematically for each model the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the distribution of the time to first failure and its mean."
"The use of the maximum entropy principle for determining prior distribution is compared with other techniques in statistical-decision theory for estimating reliability. The comparison is made in the context of estimating the parameter representing the probability of success in a binomial model and the parameter representing the mean time to failure in a simple exponential model. The existence of partial prior information of varying degrees is also assumed. When a quadratic loss function is used, the techniques based on the maximum entropy principle lose much of their appeal."
"A limited reliability mathematical model for series-parallel configurations of semiconductor couples used in radioisotopic thermoelectric generators (RTGs) is constructed. The model represents catastrophic failure reliability, which is only one important part of the total effective reliability mathematical model. It is deliberately narrow; two other major components of couple reliability, drift and load mismatch, are not discussed. The synthesis of the model, its use, and limitations are described. Probability relationships between the availability of a minimum specified power level and the assurance of electrical continuity form the framework of the model. The configuration under study is similar to internal arrangements of other power devices such as solar cells and battery cells. Here, open circuit is considered the only failure mode, viz., the probability of short circuit is negligible. The model can be applied to other power devices. Its algorithm form is suitable for adaption to a computer code."
"In this paper we assume we are repairing two-component series systems that have failed or are malfunctioning. It is further assumed that when a system is brought into the repair shop, it is not known with certainty which component has failed. If the repairman begins repairing the wrong component, a misclassification cost is incurred. It is also assumed that some resources are available for the purchase and operation of a failure detection mechanism that, depending on the amount allocated for detection, enhances the probability of correctly detecting the failed component. A study is then made that is designed to minimize the expected cost of failure detection. Examples are included."

   "In analyzing repairable systems it is often necessary to determine such parameters as availability, mean cycle time, and mean time to first failure. These and other failure time measures are defined, and methods of calculating them using a Markov approach are developed. Although conceptually simple, these methods are often not practically feasible because of the large number of possible system states. Various special techniques such as lumping states or decomposing the system into independent subsystems are discussed. These techniques, if applicable, can simplify the analysis considerably."
"The object of this paper is to present a mathematical model capable of determining the optimum amount of time that semiconductor devices, which have specified life characteristics, must be placed on burn-in to obtain maximum performance versus total cost. To make the model operational and realistic, the traditional assumption of an exponential (more recently, Weibull) distribution of life is omitted in favor of the generalized gamma distribution (GGD). This is done because the GGD includes, as special cases, such distributions as the normal, Rayleigh, Maxwell, chi, chi2, Weibull, exponential, ordinary gamma, etc. The use of the greater representational capability of the GGD is justified in the results of the studies showing that (other things being equal) small changes in parametric values of life characteristics can cause vast differences in the optimum burn-in time and maximum system effectiveness. The physical performance sector of the model incorporates system effectiveness that includes such factors as availability, expected time to repair, mission reliability, system use coefficient, storage survival probability, and operational readiness. The costs considered are those due to burn-in operation, production, and sales. The model has been studied by use of computer runs from the standpoint of critical analysis and parametric sensitivity analysis."
"Methods of determining the availability and failure frequency of systems of independent repairable units are discussed. The methods are based on representation of the system by a network or reliability block diagram. Conditions for such representation are given and methods of drawing the network are described. Two approaches for determining system reliability given the network and unit characteristics are reviewed and developed. One approach is based on successive reduction of the network and is particularly useful for series-parallel systems. The other approach is based on the determination of either the minimal paths or cuts and subsequent formula manipulations. Both approaches enable quite large systems to be analyzed."
"An algorithm is presented for evaluation of reliability of any redundant network. It uses the properties of digraphs and is especially suitable for the computer analysis of large complex networks. A method for deriving the reliability expression for any type of network is also described along with a Fortran computer program for the reliability evaluation of series-parallel networks."
"When analyzing reliability of large systems, the great number of states require much computing time and a large memory, neither of which are readily available. This paper describes a method of partitioning a set of possible states into subsets. An algorithm may be devised on the basis of this method requiring much less memory as compared to other well known methods."
"In many modern complex systems the problem of achieving high reliability leads to the use of interchangeable modular components accompanied by a stock of spare parts. This paper examines, compares, and assesses several of the techniques presented in the literature for allocating the numbers of spares of each part type to be stocked in order to maximize the system reliability subject to constraints on resources (i.e., weight, volume, cost, etc.). The problem of optimum spares allocation is complicated since resources are consumed in a discrete fashion and the expression for the system reliability is a nonlinear transcendental function. The classical dynamic programming algorithm produces all optimal spares allocations; however, the solution can become computationally intractable even with the aid of a modern high-speed digital computer. In the case of multiple constraints the time problem is vastly exacerbated. In such a case one must turn to a procedure that yields a near-optimal solution in a reasonable amount of computer time. Two approximate methods discussed in this paper are the incremental reliability per pound algorithm and the Lagrange multiplier algorithm. These algorithms are readily adaptable to handle multiple constraints. Computer programs are developed for each of the three optimization algorithms and are utilized to obtain the spares allocation for a few systems. The optimization theory presented is directly applicable to series or parallel systems. A concluding example illustrates how this can be extended to certain series-parallel systems."
"Further investigation is made of the method derived in [7] for calculating, from Weibull failure data, warranty periods for lots to be manufactured in the future. A tabulation is given of warranty periods associated with lots of size n, n = 10, 11,..., 25, for failure data obtained from samples of size m, m = 2, 3,..., n - 3. The specified assurance level is 0.95."
"This paper develops a truncated sequential test (TST) for production models that makes use of the preproduction testing and that allows unequal sample sizes from the production and the preproduction models. An example is given that compares the fixed time test (FTT) against the proposed truncated sequential test. In this example a significant reduction in testing required on the production model is achieved. Power tables for such tests are tabulated."
"A sudden death test is a special case of a multiply censored life test wherein an equal number of randomly selected surviving items are removed from the test following the occurrence of each failure. Confidence limits for the Weibull-shape parameter and a Weibull percentile may be set with a sudden death sample, using the method of maximum likelihood. An expression is found for the medium ratio of the upper to lower 100 (1 - α) percent confidence limits for a Weibul percentile under either sudden death or conventional type-II censored testing. It is proposed that this ratio be used as a criterion for determining whether a given sudden death test is more precise than a given conventional test."
"A statistical prediction interval and predictor are presented for the availability of a repairable unit during future failure and repair cycles where there are data from previous cycles. These results are based on the assumption that times to failure and times to repair are all statistically independent and exponentially distributed."
"Accelerated life data are presented on several integratedcircuit metallization systems including Al, Mo-Au, Ti-Pt-Au, and a new system Ti: W-Au where the RF sputtered Ti: W layer is a pseudo alloy of 10-20 percent Ti in W. Life tests include total water immersion, high-pressure steam and 85°C/85 percent RH/bias on bare and plastic-encapsulated devices. Heat-age and resistivity-ratio data are presented showing the metallurgical stability of the Ti: W-Au system. The corrosion resistance decreases as Ti-Pt-Au > Ti: W-Au >> Mo-Au ɥ Al."
"Error-correcting codes can be used in digital communication and storage for error control. A two-step decoding procedure is proposed for improving system performance when error correction is used. When applicable it should reduce the average decoding time or logic required for realization. Possible applications to faulty memory arrays and unit-to-unit data transmission are given."
"When bounds are sought for the reliability of a system, all available information is applied, e.g., moments of the life distribution (mainly the first moment), life percentiles obtained experimentally, and general data. Barlow et al. [1] and Epstein [2] presented bounds for a monotone-increasing or decreasing failure rate, and bounded the reliability by referring to a system with a constant failure rate. In this paper, the reliability is bounded by utilizing additional information on the behavior of the failure rate as a function of age."
"This note considers a redundant system in which the standby units may have a different probability of success than the operating units for a given mission profile. A model is developed so that one can calculate the system reliability for the mission. Furthermore, for the case where reliabilities (probabilities of mission success) of the standby units can be related to the cost of these units, a tradeoff study is made in a few special cases to determine the optimum number of standby components (in the sense of maximizing system reliability) to be installed when there is a fixed sum of money available for the installation of standby units."
"It is often stated, following a more or less well-founded process of reasoning, that the reliability of the medium-scale integrated/large-scale integrated (MSI/LSI) circuits exceeds that of the equivalent functions achieved using other technologies. The evidence generally advanced to justify this belief is the reduction in the number of interconnections. Nevertheless, is there not a danger that, above a certain complexity, a part of the gain in reliability may be lost since in these structures the elementary components depend on each other? The work set out here attempts to answer this question by modeling the failures in a structure, the elementary components of which are from one population but whose failures are not independent."
"Four relations are defined the use of which allow a reliability network to be expressed as a mathematical statement. Series and active and standby redundancy connections are allowed. The possibility of requiring more than one of the active branches to be operative is included. At the very least the result allows for typing in place of drawing a network description."

"The authors believe that using the high-level language (GCL) for code generation has advantages in terms of extendability, flexibility, and reliability."
"The work described in this paper suggests that throughput gains are possible for some work loads if dispatching is controlled by a self-adjusting algorithm thatakes into accounthe changing characteristics of tasks both singly and as a group. Minimum benefits can be anticipated when the characteristics of the tasks are homogeneous; if all tasks are heavily Iporiented or all tasks are heavily CPU-oriented, no throughput improvement can be anticipated. In fact, additional overhead will be incurred handling time intervals and manipulating task queues. Under these conditions, the only benefit is the cyclic dispatching of all CPU-oriented tasks, which prevents any single task from monopolizing use of the CPU. Maximum benefits can be anticipated for a mixture of heavily CPU-oriented and heavily Iporiented tasks. It is under these conditions that the algorithm can strive for maximum CPU-I/O overlap."
"Time-sharing systems are now an important factor in the computer industry. Because they allow a multiplicity of users to have access to a computer by means of a terminal, they encourage increasing numbers of people to utilize computers. Thus, various ways of increasing the capability of a computer in this area are being sought. One such system is the Control Program-67/Cambridge Monitor System (CP-67/CMS), a multi-access system that manages the resources of a computer set up for time-sharing such that each (remote) user appears to have a complete, dedicated computer at his disposal. This concept is known as a virtual machine and allows each user to select the operating system he wishes to run because concurrent operation of several operating systems is possible."
"The computer-assisted aeronautical charting system replaces many tedious operations in manually up-dating aeronoautical charts. By providing interactive communication with the display, the system emphasizes the editor's (chart compiler's) real contribution—his ability to aesthetically and efficiently resolve conflicts in two-dimensional data presentations. Therefore, the concepts discussed here are potentially transferable to applications involving the two-dimensional mapping of structured data, e.g., newspaper page layout, public utility mapping, and chemical and other such processing plant design."
   "The machine production of programs for testing certain aspects of programming products has been achieved. The system has been successfully used on a number of products to establish their reliability in accepting new test cases without error. The input to the system is a syntax definition in a formal notation. The construction of such a definition for a high-level language is an exacting task. It yields important bonuses by deepening knowledge of the structure of the language and showing up obscurities or ambiguities in the existing documentation, Definitions exist for ECMA Algol, FORTRAN IV, and a major subset of PL/I. The future effort required to adapt the definitions to particular versions of these languages should be small."
"Selective sharing of information has been considered in this paper only with regard to auxiliary storage in a certain general type of time-sharing system. Further study is needed to provide an efficient authorization system within the central processor's main storage. Effort is also required to enable programs to pass privileges selectively when calling other programs."
"In this paper, we described three methods of globally assigning data items to register: one-one, many-one, and many-few. Each method is a particular single-valued mapping of a set of data items into a set of registers. We developed a formulation of each method as an integer programming problem, and showed the one-one and many-one global assignment problems to be special cases of the global many-few assignment problem."
     "The original purpose of the DPS inquiry support-to provide a function that allows inquiries to disk files during stacked-job processing-was surpassed. The DPS inquiry function more generally offers the possibility of starting almost any type of high-priority program during stacked-job processing without aborting the current job in the job stack. This function is offered in a small system with reasonable safeguards to protect the user against mistakes."
"The trajectory control programs ensure the integrity and consistency of all trajectory data that is used by the flight controllers on space flights. This means that the ephemeris, which is used for many of the calculations of trajectory data, must be updated in a timely manner with no interference from other tasks. It also means that users of the ephemeris must be protected from trajectory updates that might make their data inconsistent. The objective is achieved by an elaborate queue control process that continually enables and disables various real-time queue control blocks to regulate the independenttask processing."
"We have experimentally demonstrated the technical feasibility of on-line Stenotype transcription for System/360 using a compacted dictionary program and a search algorithm for content addressing variable-length dictionary arguments. Methods of reducing word errors from twenty-seven percent to approximately six percent are discussed. Retraining in Stenotype extensions as well as modifications of the dictionary organization algorithm permit this reduction in the word-error rate."
"Queues (waiting lines) were first studied systematically by A. K. Erlang1 in connection with his investigations of telephone call delays at Danish telephone exchanges. Following this pioneering beginning in the early Twentieth Century, others who have made key contributions to a mathematical theory of queues are Pollaczeck,2,3 Kolomogorov,4 Khintchine,5 Kendall,6,7 Lindley,8 and Takacs.9–11 Queuing theory, which looks to probability theory for much of its structure, has proved useful in developing descriptive and predictive mathematical models that often lead to improvements in the services studied. As a result of this work, the theory of queues has been used in studying and improving such services as communication networks of all kinds, computing systems, production lines, transportation (harbors, tunnels, bus stations, airports, etc.) and in everyday life (e.g., banks, elevators, and supermarket checkouts)."
  "Increasing speed and size demands on computer systems have resulted in corresponding demands on storage systems. Since it has been generally recognized that the speed and capacity requirements of storage systems cannot be fulfilled at an acceptable costperformance level within any single technology, storage hierarchies that use a variety of technologies have been investigated."
"In computing systems, it is a common occurrence for the execution of a program to result in the concurrent processing of several related input files. A set of input files is considered related when at least one unprocessed record from each file must be present in memory before the program can proceed. In this paper, we discuss the effect of floating buffering on the total time required for execution of the program. An analytic model of floating buffering is developed, and conclusions about the number of floating buffers needed are presented. It is shown that an analytic model can provide valuable insight into a process, even though simplifying assumptions must be made in the model."
"The graphic simulation system discussed in this paper has been used extensively in support of the Apollo 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 flight program developments, and it has met all design objectives. By providing a new dimension of program visibility and man-computer interaction, the system has had the effect of stimulating higher levels of interest and creativity by flight analysts."
   "IBM's manufacturing plants offer a valuable test ground for studying plant automation techniques. In looking for ways to improve production processes manufacturing engineers in the company's plants have experimented with many approaches to the structure and design of plantfloor computer systems. The structural solutions have ranged from dedicated stand-alone controllers scattered throughout a plant to large hierarchical networks of general-purpose computers serving an entire factory site. The implementations have included combinations of standard and modified commercially available products as well as completely “homemade” devices and software."
"This paper is divided into two main parts. The first is concerned with definitions of concepts and terms of importance to the architect of integrated manufacturing systems. It describes the operational environment, how the manufacturing systems are going to be used, and a variety of system requirements. Priorities are established and a set of guiding principles for system design are proposed. In the second part, three basic system structures are analyzed and evaluated in terms of the previously stated priorities and guiding principles. The relation of integrated manufacturing systems to other complex systems is shown to illustrate how generally applicable many of the findings derived from knowledge of the manufacturing environment are to the design of systems for other application fields. The paper concludes by restating the key requirements and formulates what appears to be the greatest challenge for the system architect. That is, the creation of an architectural framework within which the system designers can structure manufacturing systems capable of handling besides the planned tasks a variety of unforeseen applications. Readers familiar with the plant environment and the terms and concepts associated with it may skip the first sections and start with System Requirements. We would, however, advise even the experienced reader to review the definition of real-time systems, which we believe is new."
"An integrated manufacturing process control system has been developed and implemented in several of IBM's manufacturing facilities to control process and test equipment used in the manufacture of IBM products. The system architecture consists of a central, on-line, IBM 360 Data Processing System operating under OS/360 which communicates via high-speed data channels to satellite IBM 1800, 1130 and System/360 processors. These satellite processors control various types of process and test equipment. The central system serves as a common data bank and an input/output device for the satellite processors. In addition, the central system performs data analysis and management reporting on information obtained from the manufacturing floor. This paper discusses the general system requirements and specifications along with the hardware and software required to implement those requirements and specifications. Also discussed are problems which were encountered after initial development and plans for future development."
"An integral part of a process control and testing system used in several IBM plants is the transmission control unit (TCU). This paper discusses the design of the TCU, which provides the communication link between as many as 512 satellite computers and a central computer. It uses a microprogrammed polling scheme to establish connection with the satellites that need service and it permits messages of unrestricted length to be transmitted in either direction at the rate of 2.5 × 106 bits/sec over coaxial cables. With the aid of noise suppression circuits, it operates in the electrically noisy factory environment at an error rate of less than 10−8."
"This paper discusses the design and implementation of an extension to IBM Operating System/360 that is called PCOS and is intended specifically for use in “real-time” control of IBM manufacturing processes and testing. The most important part of PCOS is a Real-Time Control Program (RTCP) which is initiated at system start-up time as a “never-ending” task. The RTCP controls the execution of application programs and permits system response to requests for their execution within a time on the order of 100 msec. Other contributions are an “express path” for handling input/output operations, an “interpartition communication” program that provides common core storage for use during the execution of application programs, and an appendage to the OS/360 supervisor program to serve a specially designed high-speed multiplexor called the “transmission control unit.”"
"A data collection and analysis system has been developed to control magnetic tape head testing and provide data analysis for manufacturing process control. Data collection is achieved by a system of test terminals controlled by an IBM 1130 computer, which is a satellite of an IBM System/360 Model 50 computer. The data base made possible by this system provides a means of tracing recurring failures and leads to a better understanding of the effects of process variables on the completed product."
"This paper reports the development of a computer-controlled machine for non-contact inspection of manufactured parts. The machine, called PAMM (Precision Automatic Measuring Machine), is capable of providing “on-the-fly” measurements accurate to within 100 microinches. The intersection of a rotating spiral slot with a stationary linear slot produces a moving aperture for scanning in small increments over a projected, enlarged image of a part. The scanner assembly moves along an overhead cantilever beam in the x direction, and the part being inspected moves in the y direction along the machine base; position in each direction is monitored by a separate laser interferometer. In the paper conventional methods of coordinate measuring are briefly reviewed, the details of the new design are presented, some experimentally obtained measurements are given, measurement errors induced by photodetector shot noise and aperture roughness are analyzed, and the computer-control and data-analysis techniques are discussed."
"The recently announced IBM System/7 was developed for use in a broad range of data acquisition and control applications and provides the foundation for comprehensive plant automation applications. Its unique modular structure and broad spectrum of features satisfy the basic plant automation requirements described in the paper by Kinberg and Landeck in this issue. In the present paper the functional characteristics, important design features, and the basic architectural concepts of hardware and software are discussed. An example of the use of this new system in the automation of the System/7 manufacturing process itself is provided to illustrate its use in the testing of complex electronic assemblies as part of an integrated plant automation system."
"A tandem connection of terminals for a data collection system has certain desirable advantages over the more common radial configuration. To make use of these advantages, high-speed transmission links are required. This paper describes the transmission capability necessary for a high-speed digital data repeater when it is restricted to an in-house environment. The transmission techniques discussed are implemented in the IBM 2790 Data Communication System."
"The Percus-Yevick theory can be used to calculate the pair distribution function and from this the equation of state. The conventional method is to calculate the pressure of compressibility directly, unfortunately yielding poor results for the 6:12 fluid at low temperatures. In this paper results are obtained using an indirect method, in which the energy is calculated from the pair distribution function, and the equation of state is obtained by thermodynamic identities. These results are virtually in exact agreement with the machine calculation results for the 6:12 potential and with experimental results for argon."
"The iterated consensus method for obtaining prime implicants of Boolean functions has several advantages with respect to the conventional tabular method. However, when one attempts to apply the iterated consensus method to multiple-output functions using the rules set forth in the existing literature, it is possible that some of the prime implicants will not be produced. This communication presents an algorithm which assures that all prime implicants of multiple-output functions will be found."
"Sets of waveforms called TPF's, which are products of trigonometric functions, may have application in communications technology, network analysis and signal processing. This communication briefly reviews the characteristics of TPF's and presents methods for calculating their cross-correlation coefficients when 1) all TPF's in a set have harmonic factors with the same set of values, and 2) the harmonic factors have different values."
"Multiple closely spaced layers of GaAs1−xPx, which approximate a one-dimensional crystalline superlattice, have been created by periodically pulsing PH3 into an AsH3-PH3-Ga-HCl vapor-growth apparatus. The phosphorus mole fraction varies between maximum and minimum values with a period typically less than 200Å. Structures with up to 150 such layers have been produced. The crystal growth process and methods of characterization are discussed briefly."
"Recently Gunn presented a simple formula for the domain velocity in a “diffusion-controlled” semiconductor, based on topological arguments. It is shown that these arguments are generally not valid. The apparent agreement between Gunn's formula and Hauge's computer simulation is briefly discussed."

   "“… before the computer truly enlarges the citizen's world … I think that first of all we have to change the way we do software… .We must make it possible for everyone to communicate with a computer…. We must also increase [the computer's] reliability and think of computers not as machines in the basement but as devices that provide a service to a community and cannot fail. Let me assure you that this is an important change in the framework of mind of today's designers and manufacturers. We must achieve reliabilities that are unknown to computers today, but are feasible…”"
"This paper describes many of the pseudoternary (PT) codes (twinned, bipolar, partial response, etc.) used in data transmission. In these, binary information is transmitted through three-level rather than binary pulse codes for controlling the power distribution in the frequency spectrum, improving clock recovery, allowing error detection or for just increasing the binary data rate. Linear and nonlinear PT codes are considered, the latter being divided into alphabetic and nonalphabetic codes. Among the nonalphabetic codes, emphasis is given to the modified bipolar codes used in pulse code modulation systems. Two recently developed codes of this type are described: High Density Bipolar (HDB) and Compatible High Density Bipolar (CHDB). They are particularly suitable for PCM transmission on repeatered lines. Another nonalphabetic code, the Transparent Interleaved Bipolar (TIB) is presented for the first time. This code features all the advantages of partial-response (or Interleaved Bipolar) signalling and, in addition, guarantees a minimum density of pulses, regardless of the data."
"Methods are presented for the encoding of information into binary sequences in which the number of ZEROS occurring between each pair of successive ONES has both an upper and a lower bound. The techniques, based on the state structure of the constraints, permit the construction of short, efficient codes with favorable error-propagation-limiting properties."
"The 800-bit-per-inch magnetic tape units that are components of IBM System/360 can correct error bursts of unlimited length in any one of their nine tape tracks. The correction technique employs a modified cyclic code in conjunction with a parity bit in each nine-bit character. There are nine check bits in the modified cyclic code and these form a check character at the end of every record. To perform the correction, a record in which an error has been detected must be reread. Errors involving more than one track within the same record are detected but are not correctable. This error correction technique operates during both read-forward and read-backward operations, and on records of any length."
"A new class of multiple-error correcting codes has been developed. Since it belongs to the class of one-step-decodable majority codes, it can be decoded at an exceptionally high speed. This class of codes is derived from a set of mutually orthogonal Latin squares. This mutually orthogonal property provides a class of codes having a unique feature of “modularity.” The parity check matrix possesses a uniform pattern and results in a small number of inputs to modulo 2 adders. This class of codes has m2 data bits, where m is an integer, and 2tm check bits for t-error correcting."
"The class of codes described in this paper is used for single-error correction and double-error detection (SEC-DED). It is equivalent to the Hamming SEC-DED code in the sense that for a specified number k of data bits, the same number of check bits r is used. The minimum odd-weight-column code is suitable for applications to computer memories or parallel systems. A computation indicates that this code is better in performance, cost and reliability than are conventional Hamming SEC-DED codes."
"A high-speed method is derived for single-symbol error correcting Reed-Solomon and Hamming type codes. A matrix description is used for implementation of the codes, in which single-error correction in the Galois field 2b corresponds to correcting a block of b bits in a binary field. The resulting codes correct not only single-bit errors but also single clusters of b-adjacent-bit errors."
"Three measures of the complexity of error correcting decoders are considered, namely, logic complexity, computation time and computational work (the number of logical operations). Bounds on the complexity required with each measure to decode with probability of error Pe at code rate R are given and the complexity of a number of ad hoc decoding procedures is examined."
"A comparison is made of the performance of pure retransmission, forward error correction and hybrid (error detecting/correcting) schemes for data transmission in a noisy (probability of error, P > 10−4) binary symmetric channel. The performance calculations are based on the use of BCH codes for error detection and correction up to the full correction capability of the code. It is shown that a probability of undetected error of less than 10−9 error/bit, can be achieved by correcting only a few errors while retaining a reasonable throughput and a very low retransmission rate. The best codes in the class considered are specified and the complexity of instrumentation is estimated. Finally, various combinations of possible systems employing half duplex and reverse channel operation are used in a comparison of the transmission schemes. For line error rate worse than 10−4 error/bit, a hybrid system operating with a reverse channel is superior to the other possibilities."
"All n-digit maximal block codes with a specified minimum distance d such that 2d ≥ n can be constructed from the Hadamard matrices. These codes meet the Plotkin bound. In this paper we construct all maximal group codes in the region 2d ≥ n, where d is a specified minimum distance and n is the number of digits per code word. Unlike the case of block codes, the Plotkin upper limit, in general, fails to determine the number of code words B(n, d) in a maximal group code in the region 2d ≥ n. We show that the value of B(n, d) largely depends on the binary structure of the number d. An algorithm is developed that determines B(n, d), the maximum number of code words for given d and n ≤ 2d. The maximal code is, then, given by its modular representation, explicitly in terms of certain binary coefficients and constants related to n and d. As a side result, we obtain a new upper bound on the number of code words in the region 2d < n which is, in general, stronger than Plotkin's extended bound."
"The intensities of low energy electron beams specularly and nonspecularly diffracted from {100}, {110} and {111} surfaces of aluminum have been measured in a display-type LEED system as functions of electron energy, angle of incidence and azimuthal angle. Several of the measured and normalized spectra are presented, and the procedures followed in aligning the sample, reducing stray magnetic fields, and collecting and normalizing the data are described."
"Misfit dislocation nets are known to occur when very high amounts of phosphorus and boron are diffused into silicon single-crystal wafers. Diffusion of arsenic in silicon is not known to produce such dislocations. Through transmission electron microscopy it is shown in this paper that diffusion of high amounts (up to 1.6 × 1021 atoms/cm3) of arsenic creates Frank hexagonal loops on (111) planes parallel to the diffusion surface, and stacking faults on the inclined {111} planes, instead of misfit dislocation nets (the latter are still not observed). These faults and loops are found to be extrinsic, and are thought to be due to insertion of extra silicon layers in the matrix where the stacking fault energy is decreased by arsenic atoms. The driving force for the generation of loops and faults is shown to be the concentration gradient rather than fast cooling."
"We have found that the lifetime of aluminum films subjected to high current densities at elevated temperatures can be increased by the addition of copper. Previous studies have indicated that the failure mechanism is a combination of electromigration-induced phenomena, including nucleation and growth of voids, which are gated primarily by material transport along grain boundaries. On the basis of the present study, it appears that the presence of copper causes an appreciable retardation in the rate at which this overall combination of processes takes place, thereby producing a considerable increase in lifetime."

  "Various coding schemes and their effects on intersymbol interference in pulse amplitude modulation systems are discussed. First, the relation between imperfections in the baseband-equivalent channel and intersymbol interference is clarified and applied to explain the effect of correlative level coding and Gorog's frequency concept codes in reducing intersymbol interference. Another coding scheme is then introduced: construction of codes in the time domain with intersymbol interference directly in mind. A decimal code of length 4 and an alphanumeric code of length 6 are proposed as practical codes and their properties are discussed. Simulation results are presented to give quantitative comparison of these coding techniques. Curves of the vertical eye-opening vs transmission rate have been produced and we show that codes designed in the time domain achieve better performance than both the frequency concept codes and the conventional codes for a wide class of channel characteristics."
"The man-machine interface at any terminal in a computer system is a likely source of error and can be regarded as a noisy channel. Certain data, such as ID numbers, can be precoded to protect against most-likely errors, including transposition of adjacent symbols and substitutions, as well as deletions and insertions. This paper first considers certain basic requirements for error detection with minimum redundancy. An efficient special coding scheme designed for decimal terminals is described next. Finally, certain cyclic codes are shown to be adaptable to transposition error control when appropriate decoding schemes are implemented."
"A magnetic recording channel can be regarded as a “partial-response” channel because of its inherent differentiation in the readback process. The conventional NRZI method of recording is shown to be equivalent to the “precoding” of this particular partial-response channel, the purpose of which is to limit the propagation of error in the channel output. Using this new viewpoint, one can readily adopt an error detection scheme (developed for general partial-response channels) that takes full advantage of the inherent redundancy in the three-level channel output. The detection scheme is optimum in the sense that it detects all detectable errors with minimum delay."
"Holography and modern digital computing technology represent two apparently unrelated aspects of information processing, both of which have matured rapidly in the last five years. Over the past few years, however, interactions between the two fields have become more apparent. To take note of these interactions, a Conference on Holography and the Computer was held in Houston, Texas, December 10–12, 1969, under the auspices of the Gulf Coast Section of the Optical Society of America and the IBM Corporation. The bulk of this issue of the IBM Journal of Research and Development is devoted to selected papers presented at that Conference."
"If the Fourier transform of a function g(x) is quantized, the function recovered by inverse transformation differs from g(x). By means of a biased limiter model, the effects of Fourier-domain phase quantization are studied. Amplitude information is assumed fully retained, while phase is quantized to N equally spaced levels. The recovered function is shown to consist of several different contributions, the relative strengths of which depend on the number of phase quantization levels. Several specific examples are given. Motivation and interpretation are presented in terms of digitally constructed holograms."
"Incoherent optical filtering with the kinoform used as a filtering element is discussed. Kinoform theory is briefly reviewed and initial results with “fan” and correlation filters are presented."
"This paper is an analysis of how acoustic (or microwave) holography can be applied to large masses, such as natural bodies of water or the earth, by means of a linear array of microphones and by scanning with one or more transmitters to produce holographic phase shifts. This type of hologram, in which the phased array has a conical antenna pattern, is shown to be superior to the area hologram for computing images in the near field. Computer simulations are given of virtual holograms and image reconstructions for specular and diffuse reflectors; simulations are also made for the case of pulse holography, which yields genuine three-dimensional images with reduced highlight distortions."
"The number of degrees of freedom, or structural-information content, of the object wave field recorded in a Leith-Upatnieks hologram is expressed in terms of the resolving power and dimensions of the recording medium, the coherence properties of the primary illumination and the position of the point reference source. In contrast with previous studies, the calculation does not involve the paraxial approximation. It is shown that of all holograms, the Fourier-transform hologram makes the most efficient use of available resolving power and coherence length."
"“Objective” speckle arises from the uneven illumination of an object with a multiplicity of waves that interfere at its surface. “Subjective” speckle arises at rough objects even if they are illuminated evenly by a single wave. The noise in the image is caused by the interference of the point-figures, which have random phases. Subjective speckle cannot be reduced except by extending the aperture. On the other hand the “objective” speckle in a plane, for instance in the plane of a transparency, can be reduced, and in the limit made invisible, by a special type of wide-angle illumination. This consists of a one-parameter family of plane waves, which can be produced by diffraction at a special grating, or two crossed gratings, close to the object plane. This makes it possible to produce multiple holograms, with the same insensitivity to dust or scratches as diffused holograms, but without any visible speckle in the reconstruction."
"The Kelly three-stage model of photographic information recording is a mathematical model of black-and-white silver-halide film with granularity neglected. In the work reported here, the theory is extended for use in phase-holographic applications. Granularity effects are contained in the fourth and final stage, a two-dimensional, nonhomogeneous, filtered Poisson process. The output of this stage is a sample function of the random process that describes the pattern of modification of the emulsion. Formulas for the signal-to-noise ratio of a hologram and the optimum granular behavior are derived as examples of the use of the granularity model."
"Noise and distortion limit the usefulness of the photographic transparency as a data-storage medium. The noise, which tends to be multiplicative, derives from the random distribution of silver grains in the photographic image, as well as from thickness variations in the developed emulsion. Distortion, on the other hand, results from 1) the nonlinear relation between transmittance and exposure, 2) the finite width of the emulsion's point-spread function and 3) the existence of an adjacency-enhancement function. Although grain noise remains intrinsic and untreatable, nonlinear distortion—both global and local—may be treated by lowering the contrast of the exposure pattern or, preferably, by recording the data in the form of a phase-modulated carrier wave, as in holography. A solution to the remaining difficulty, namely, linear-global distortion, is obtained through the use of high-resolution, Lippmann-type emulsions."
"The diffraction efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio for two-dimensional and volume diffuse-signal-beam holograms are calculated and experimentally determined. Calculations are based on the statistical properties of the signal beam, and exact integrals rather than series approximations are used. High signal-to-noise ratio and high diffraction efficiency are possible, with the peak calculated diffraction efficiency being 22% for two-dimensional and 64% for volume holograms. The experimentally achieved efficiencies were 12% for two-dimensional and 36% for volume holograms."
"Optimum conditions for the generation of high-efficiency hologram gratings are presented. The most efficient phase holograms were obtained for exposures 10 to 20 times larger than those for optimally exposed amplitude holograms. Hologram gratings produced on Agfa Gevaert 8 E 70 recording plates diffracted 40 percent of the incident radiation into the holographic image. This experimentally obtained efficiency is 60 percent of the theoretical maximum for a hologram with a geometric parameter Q of 4.6."
"The maximum entropy principle is used as the criterion for calculating the equilibrium state probabilities of a queuing or network system in which service rates are exponentially distributed. A configuration-independent partition function is given as the solution to this network problem; from this function the important properties of the system may be derived. Simple and well known examples are used to illustrate the method. A phenomenon similar to the phase transition of statistical mechanics is observed in a queuing model."
"Handprinted characters can be made more uniform in appearance than the as-written version if an appropriate linear transformation is performed on each input pattern. The transformation can be implemented electronically by programming a flying-spot raster-scanner to scan at specified angles rather than only along specified axes. Alternatively, curve-follower normalization can be achieved by transforming the coordinate waveforms in a linear combining network. Second-order moments of the pattern are convenient properties to use in specifying the transformation. By mapping the original pattern into one having a scalar moment matrix all linear pattern variations can be removed. Comparison experiments with three sets of handprinted numerals showed that error rates were reduced by integral factors if the patterns were normalized before scanning for recognition."
"A procedure is described that shows how a technique used to develop performance bounds for a large class of nonlinear dynamic systems with state-dependent control policies can be extended to determine whether a nonlinear system can be controlled so that it is at least “performance equivalent” to an associated optimally controlled linear system. A procedure for generating one or more control policies to attain this equivalence is also discussed. An example illustrates the fact that more than one control policy may satisfy the equivalence criterion."
"This paper presents an evaluation of the relative merits of two schemes for performing concurrent error detection in group look-ahead adders. One of the schemes is a residue mod 3 check and the other is a parity prediction check. The Boolean statements that define the operation of group look-ahead adders, concurrent error detection and the Boolean difference serve as background for interpreting the results of the study. The Boolean difference is a tool for calculating the “coverage” of elements in a logical network by error-checking schemes. Some weaknesses in prior studies of coverage calculation are brought to light. Tables showing the number of circuit elements in the various portions of adder and error-checking circuits are given. It is shown that the residue mod 3 check adder is not economical unless the addition operands are already provided with the mod 3 check bits. Thus, a worthwhile comparison of the checking schemes should not proceed without considering the overall data flow checking strategy. In machine organizations with three or more data transfer checks, the parity-checked adder seems to offer a cost advantage."

   "The dynamic performance of Schottky-barrier field-effect transistors is discussed, with the aim of finding in a most simple way the physical parameters on which the dynamic properties of a FET depend, how strong they influence the dynamic qualities of FET's, and what recommendations can be given as to proper choice of material or structure for FET's with good high-frequency performance."
"A two-dimensional analysis is presented of the mechanisms of operation for a junction field-effect transistor. Particular emphasis is placed upon the process of electric current saturation in both wide gate and narrow gate structures. It is shown that velocity saturated carrier transport in a source-drain channel produces heretofore unreported mechanisms of device operation. Comparisons made between the conclusions derived from this two-dimensional analysis and the conventional one-dimensional theory of JFET operation are presented in graphic form."
"Projection masking is used for producing microwave semiconductor devices with micrometer or submicrometer structures. In contrast to contact masking, the mask is projected onto the silicon wafer by means of a high quality microscope objective. Since the chromatic errors of such a lens cannot be fully corrected, monochromatic light has to be employed. This, however, causes standing light waves to occur in the SiO2 and photoresist layers, leading to unexpected effects. This report describes some of these effects and the experimental conditions under which satisfactory masking results can be obtained."
"The microwave properties of silicon Schottky-barrier field-effect transistors (MESFET's) with a gate-length of one micrometer are investigated. The scattering parameters of the transistors have been measured from 0.1 GHz up to 12 GHz. From the measured data an equivalent circuit is established which consists of an intrinsic transistor and extrinsic elements. Some of the elements of the intrinsic transistor, notably the transconductance, are strongly influenced by the saturation of the drift velocity. Best performance of the intrinsic transistor is obtained with highly doped and thin channels. The measured power-gain is in good agreement with theoretical values deduced from the equivalent circuit. The best device has a maximum frequency of oscillation ƒmax of 12 GHz. The investigation reveals that the extrinsic elements, especially the resistance of the gate-metallization and the gate-pad parasitics, degrade the power-gain considerably. Without them a value of ƒmax close to 20 GHz is predicted."
"Silicon wafer processing is described which provides submicrometer epitaxial layers on top of high-resistivity silicon substrates for fabrication of high-frequency metal-semiconductor field-effect transistors. Silicon-dioxide underetching at the border of an oxide window, performed in hydrogen at elevated temperatures, is one method of realizing 1-micrometer device structures."
"The metallization processes necessary for the production of microwave Schottky-barrier field-effect transistors are described. Since the gate contact is only 1 micrometer wide, the holes and the metallization of the source, drain and gate contacts are produced simultaneously. Then in a subsequent process, the source and drain contacts are converted to ohmic contacts by the evaporation of Au-Sb onto these contacts. Mask alignment is not a problem because the Au-Sb spreads across the surface after suitable heat treatment."
"Minimal energy dissipations for the logic process based on thermodynamics and general phase space considerations are known. The actual availability of these minimal dissipations has not, however, been demonstrated. These minimal dissipation sources in a computing system also act as noise sources and thereby lead to questions about the ultimate available reliability of the computing process. A new and hypothetical device is presented in this paper and used to construct a physically analyzable computing system. It is demonstrated that this system has dissipations larger than, but of the same order of magnitude as, the original minimal quantities. It is also shown that any required reliability can be obtained with this device, without increased energy expenditure, but at the expense of an increasing time per computational step."
"Heat is produced in short periods of time during pulsed operation of an injection laser. The temperature of the laser at the beginning of any pulse due to the heating caused by preceding pulses is calculated for several simple model cases. The results are applied in the description of performance deterioration caused by heating."
"The operation of rf discharges is described and the internal distribution of voltages is considered. The significance of this with respect to sputtering, particularly of insulators, is then discussed. An equivalent circuit for the discharge is presented and the influence of such parameters as pressure and magnetic field on the components of this circuit is described. Finally, energy distributions for positive ions, electrons, and negative ions incident at the substrate during deposition are given."
"A means has been found to control the rf potential of the substrate during rf sputtering. The application of this technique to the deposition of silica films has been investigated in detail. The technique can be described as the use of an adjustable rf impedance between the substrate holder and ground electrodes, which generates an rf potential by virtue of the flow of rf current through it. Adjustment of the rf potential of the substrate results in a controlled dc bias potential developed at the film surface, which correlates directly with the physical properties of the deposited films. In general, the most desirable film properties are obtained when the dc substrate bias (obtained by adjusting the substrate-holder rf impedance) is at a high negative potential. The effect of substrate bias on etch rate, pinhole breakup thickness, and argon content has been measured."
"An improved technique for measuring re-emission coefficients is described and data on the effect of temperature are presented. These are discussed in the light of a physical model of film growth during sputtering wherein constant re-emission of material throughout deposition occurs. Evidence is then presented that such re-emission is essential if films of high quality are to be obtained. To help assess “quality” in a quantitative fashion use has been made of the PBUT (pin-hole breakup thickness) phenomenon, which is described in some detail. The influence on PBUT of several system parameters such as sputtering pressure and impurity content is discussed and related to the re-emission coefficient."
"The successful application of rf sputtered SiO2 in the passivation of silicon semiconductor devices depends in part on the proper control of ionic charge migration in the insulator during sputtering, and on the adequate coverage of metal line edges by the insulator. It is shown that an appropriate combination of target purity, substrate temperature control and phosphosilicate blocking layer thickness can be used to achieve ionic charge densities at the silicon-SiO2 interface of less than 1×1012 charges per square centimeter. The effects of argon ion bombardment are shown to be acceptably low for typical operating conditions. In a conventional system, the adequate coverage of metal line edges is shown to be influenced primarily by argon pressure and magnetic field. In a special system where the substrate potential can be varied, it has been shown that adequate edge coverage can be obtained at sufficiently negative potentials. These data are consistent with a mechanism requiring some resputtering to obtain the desired film coverage."
"A previously described' “L” type matching network used for rf sputtering is shown here as part of Fig. 1. The purpose of the network is to transform the complex impedance of a sputtering system to a purely resistive value of 50 Ω. This makes possible the use of a transmission line with a characteristic impedance of 50 for the conveyance of rf power to the system. The rf power is conveniently monitored by a power meter in the transmission line. Since the power meter is capable of measuring both forward and reflected power, the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) on the transmission line can be computed. The VSWR will be unity when the matching network is adjusted so that the transmission line is terminated in its characteristic impedance. Practically, it is difficult to achieve a VSWR of unity (zero reflected power), so the network is adjusted to approach that optimum state as nearly as possible."

    "Magnetic semiconductors are materials with good band conductivity as well as magnetic order. Since each phenomenon requires a different description of the relevant electron states, the band structure of these materials is very complicated, containing band states as well as localized states. An important condition for strong interaction between the magnetic and the conducting electrons appears to be the existence of high densities of states at the Fermi energy, providing large carrier polarizations in the magnetized state."
"Superexchange mechanisms, which are mostly responsible for the nnn exchange constant I2 in Eu chalcogenides, are investigated in detail. In contrast with the usual 3d transition metal compounds, the Kramers-Anderson mechanism is estimated to be one order of magnitude too small to explain the experimental results due to a small 4f → 2p transfer energy. The mechanism by which a p electron is transferred to a 5d state through the d-f exchange interaction gives the correct order of magnitude for I2, with a negative sign, even though it is a sixth-order perturbation. The cross term between the above two mechanisms is shown to be nearly as important as the second mechanism and may have a positive sign. The indirect exchange mechanisms, in which the anion p level has no important role, are responsible for the nn exchange constant I1. The phonon-assisted mechanism proposed by Smit is estimated to be more than one order of magnitude smaller than the experimental value. The d-f mixing term is proved to be responsible for I1, in good agreement with experiment."
"UP, US, and the UP-US solid solutions have the NaCl-type structure and are good conductors of electricity. UP is anti-ferromagnetic of type I; US is ferromagnetic. Assuming U4+ cations, P3− and S2− anions, and RKKY interactions between the uranium localized 5f-electrons via the conduction electrons (≈1 in UP and ≈2 in US), the observed magnetic structures are accounted for, although these structures are also predicted by molecular field theory. A neutron diffraction study of the UP-US solid solutions has revealed two new magnetic structures, the type IA (2+, 2=) antiferromagnetic structure and the antiphase (5+, 4=) ferrimagnetic structure, which are of long range (several lattice parameters) and are typical of long-range RKKY-type interactions, as assumed in the simple model for these compounds. Further experimental evidence is given for the long-range magnetic interactions in uranium monopnictides and monochalcogenides and their solid solutions. The situation in these uranium compounds is compared with the corresponding lanthanide compounds, and the role of covalency and superexchange in the case of heavier anions is discussed."
"The transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit a wide variety of both electrical and magnetic properties, from insulators to superconductors and from ferromagnetism through antiferromagnetism to diamagnetism. NiS2 is a semiconductor with an anomalous paramagnetic behavior which leaves in doubt the existence of a local moment. Previous neutron diffraction data have failed to show any ordering down to 4.2°K. Our neutron powder diffraction data on stoichiometric NiS2 show a transition at 40°K to a structure which can be described as ordering of the first kind. This is followed by an abrupt transition at 30°K in which additional diffraction peaks appear and these are consistent with ordering of the second kind. Despite the fact that the powder data cannot indicate an unambiguous magnetic structure, the magnitude of the ordered moment can be fixed. The rms moments associated with ordering of the first and second kinds are 1.0 and 0.60 µB per nickel atom, respectively, and the total moment is 1.17 µB per nickel atom."
"The low-temperature specific heat of a series of semiconductor alloys of the SnTe-MnTe system, for Mn to Sn ratios of 0 to 0.1 has been measured in the temperature range 2 to 25°K. Large anomalies are observed due, presumably, to the ordering of the Mn++ spin system. The temperature region over which these anomalies occur is roughly the region in which ferromagnetism is observed."
"Recent work concerning the electrical properties of ReO3, PrOx, (1.5 ≤ x ≤ 2.0), TiO2, SrTiO3, perovskites, CrO2, NiO, LixZn1−xV2O4, V2O3, and Ti2O3 has been selectively reviewed in attempts to elucidate the conduction properties of the charge carriers. A number of controversial issues are pointed out: Frequently it is not known whether mobilities are activated or not, nor whether a given material should be classified as a polaronic or mixed-carrier material; neither is there agreement on the nature of electrical transitions. Discrepancies in electrical properties can generally be traced to insufficient control over preparation and characterization of samples."
"Hall effect measurements were made on a single crystal of magnetite in the temperature range 65 to 373°K. The Hall voltage was positive over the whole temperature range. The results can be explained by assuming that magnetite is a normal semiconductor below the transition point and a degenerate one above that temperature."
"The mechanism of electrical conduction in the magnetic semiconductors NixFe3−xO4 with 0.6 < x ≤ 1 was investigated. The electrical properties of these compounds are extremely sensitive to the presence of α-Fe2O3 as a second phase. The exponential temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity ρ and the temperature-independent thermoelectric power θ are in good agreement with an electron-hopping model. The electrical conduction occurs by thermally activated electron hopping between octahedral Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions with an activation energy q. The values of ρ, q and θ depend on the Fe2+ concentration only, and are not sensitive to small deviations from stoichiometry due to the presence of cation or anion vacancies."
"The metal-insulator transition in the V2O3 system is discussed. A recent series of experiments on V2O3 and (V1−xCrx)2O3 is reviewed. The phase diagram for the system is described. The Cr-doped mixed oxides are insulating at room temperature for x ≥ 0.009 and transform to a metal with the application of pressure. This phase transition is identified as a Mott transition. A comparison is made between the experimental results and theoretical predictions of the Mott transition."
"Samples of polycrystalline (La1−xCax)MnO3, where x takes values ranging from 0.005 to 0.3, have been studied experimentally. Specimens were carefully prepared in the stoichiometric forms by changing the oxygen partial pressure conditions for each value of x. For specimens having x smaller than 0.1, the Néel temperature TN is almost constant, 141°K, while the paramagnetic Curie temperature θ increases as x increases. On the other hand, for specimens in which x is greater than 0.1, both TN (or Tc) and θ are almost equal and increase with the value of x. The Mn55 NMR spectra associated with Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions were observed in specimens having x smaller than 0.175, while motionally narrowed Mn55 spectra were observed where the values of x were 0.2 or 0.3. All the experimental results could be qualitatively explained by postulating that the d holes at the sites around Ca2+ ions contribute to both the electrical conduction and the magnetic interaction. The ferromagnetic interaction induced by mobile d holes can not be ascribed to the double-exchange interaction, if this interaction has the usual form b cos (θ/2)."
"The band structure of materials in which both localized and itinerant outer electrons are simultaneously present is discussed. The Franck-Condon Principle is applied, and small and large polar on formation is taken into account. A scheme for estimating the densities-of-states of perfect crystals and doped or non-stoichiometric crystals is suggested, based on the ionic many-body states as a starting point. Screening, covalency, crystalline-field and overlap effects are quantitatively considered. In particular, the band structures of both pure and Li-doped NiO are derived and found to be in agreement with the experimental observations. It is shown that conclusions which are based on ordinary donor and acceptor techniques fail to account for the effects of doping even in a qualitatively correct manner, due to the neglect of important correlation effects."
"Transport properties of pure and doped Eu chalcogenides are reviewed to determine the mechanisms responsible for the anomalous behavior near Tc, the Curie temperature. It is found that, whereas the scattering theory of simple metals accounts for the behavior of materials containing impurities in excess of 2 × 1020 cm−3, several models for transport have been proposed for smaller concentrations. The impurity hopping model appears to be consistent with the data for very dilute systems."
"The conductivity of EuO has been measured as a function of temperature from 30 to 300°K in magnetic fields up to 50 kG. The zero-field resistivity exhibits a sharp elbow at about 50°K, and increases as much as 108 between 50 and 70°K to a broad maximum between 75 and 80°K. In an applied magnetic field, the broad maximum is rapidly decreased and the elbow is shifted to higher temperatures. These data are interpreted in terms of a transfer of electrons between a conduction band and an electron trap. In the model the energy separation between the band and trap level depends on the magnetic energy of the crystal and is thus a strong function of temperature and magnetic field. At low temperatures the trap level is assumed to be above the conduction band edge such that the electrons lie in the band. As the temperature is increased the energy of the band edge increases such that it crosses the trap level at about 50°K. The large increase in resistivity with increasing temperature and the effects due to the magnetic field are explained by the transfer of electrons from the energy band into the trap states."
"The observation of zero-bias anomalies in tunneling has received much attention but their interpretation has suffered from a lack of definition of the character of the tunneling barrier. Junctions formed from a metal with Eu-chalcogenide ferromagnetic semiconductors offer a potential means of overcoming this difficulty. We have made rectifying junctions of EuS:Eu on In. The results indicate: 1) a large resistivity peak at zero-bias voltage which, in the ferromagnetic region, has a strong magnetic-field dependence, and 2) a resistance maximum near 30 mV which has been tentatively assigned to excitation of collective modes in the bulk of the semiconductor. We interpret the present results by considering excitation of ferromagnetic magnons in the barrier region."
"Magnetic semiconductors are characterized by the presence of charge carriers and magnetic moments. The interaction between the charge carriers and the magnetic moments leads to a spin splitting of the energy bands, and to spin-disorder scattering of the charge carriers. The result is a strong influence of magnetic properties on the transport properties. The theory of these effects is discussed in the first part of this paper. In the second part two models for the band structure of CdCr2Se4 are discussed, and compared with experimental data on the optical properties and the transport properties."
"A phenomenological model is presented to explain the anomalous temperature dependencies of the electrical resistivity and the Hall and Seebeck coefficients of indium-doped CdCr2Se4 with selenium deficiencies. The model postulates the existence of a hole band below localized donor levels, well above the intrinsic valence band. The assumed relative motions of the hole band and the donor level as the temperature is lowered, together with the optically deduced downward motion of the conduction band, are adequate to explain the data in a consistent manner. It is hypothesized that the hole band as well as the donor levels are related to the combination of indium ions and selenium deficiencies."
"The high-field longitudinal magnetoresistance of the ferromagnetic (polycrystalline) p-type semiconductor AgxCd1−xCr2Se4 has been measured as a function of temperature and applied magnetic and electric fields. It is suggested that the observed “anomalies” may be related to the possible spin wave-carrier wave interactions in these materials."
"Several aspects of electronic transport in nonmagnetic and magnetic transition metal oxides are reviewed. These include high- and low-temperature measurements of conductivity, the Hall effect and the Seebeck effect, and their analysis in terms of the electronic energy structure. Particular emphasis is put on the temperature dependence of the Hall mobility, which gives essential information concerning the correct description of the energy states and the scattering of the charge carriers. The second half of the paper discusses the relation between the transport properties and the magnetic ordering. The properties of LaCoO3 together with an interpretation suggested by Goodenough are presented to illustrate this point."
"The measured optical properties of the Eu chalcogenides are surveyed in an attempt to determine those aspects of the electronic structure of these materials that have been established. Optical absorption as well as optical and magneto-optical reflectivity data are discussed, along with the results of photoconductivity, photoluminescence and photoemission measurements and of magneto-optical measurements in the vicinity of the absorption edge. It is concluded that the fundamental absorption edge is due to the onset of Eu++ 4f to 5d transitions of the type 4f7(8S7/2) → 4f6(7FJ)5d(T2g) and that a higher energy reflectivity peak is primarily due to 4f7(8S7/2) → 4f6(7FJ)5d(Eg) transitions, although anion p-valence band to Eu conduction band transitions may also be involved. The principal unanswered questions involve the relative positions of the Eu 6s and 5d(T2g) states, the breadth of the 5d levels and the role played by exciton effects in the 4f to 5d optical transitions."
"The reflectivity of the ferromagnetic semiconductors EuO, EuS and EuSe has been measured as a function of temperature and light polarization in an orienting magnetic field. In the energy range from just above the absorption edges to about 5.0 eV, there are two prominent features, E1 and E2, which change with the magnetic order, indicating exchange splittings of the 5d states. Antiferromagnetic EuTe shows a different structure in the E1 and E2 peaks. However, with a large magnetic field applied (>40 kOe) the spectrum becomes characteristic of the other ferromagnetic europium chalcogenides suggesting a phase transition to parallel spin alignment at H ≈ 80 kOe. The effect provides direct experimental confirmation of the band theory prediction that there are superlattice splittings in the band structure of an antiferromagnetic crystal."
"The 4T1 and 4T2 crystal-field transitions of Cr3+ have been observed in the absorption spectrum of CdIn2S4(Cr). From the similarity between the temperature dependence of the 4T2 band and the reported blue shift of the absorption edge of CdCr2S4 it is concluded that in CdCr2S4 this edge is caused by the 4T2 absorption band of the Cr3+ ions. The polar magneto-optic Kerr effect between 560 and 700 nm and the Faraday rotation between 800 and 8000 nm are reported for CdCr2S4. The Kerr effect spectrum indicates that the intrinsic band edge of CdCr2S4 is at 1.91 eV at 60°K and shifts to lower energies with decreasing temperature."
"Measurements of the magneto-optical rotation in CdCr2Se4 at wavelengths between 0.9 and 1.3 µm are reported. In the paramagnetic state, the rotation passes a minimum with decreasing wavelength and changes sign at the absorption edge. The Verdet constant is proportional to the paramagnetic susceptibility (V = −18 deg/kOe-cm at 300°K and λ = 1.05 µm). In the ferromagnetic state the Faraday effect is large and the sign reversal very pronounced; e.g., the rotation changes by 6.5 × 104 deg/cm in a wavelength interval of 400 Å in saturated material at 93°K. The photon energy at which the sign reversal occurs shows a strong temperature-dependent red shift; the temperature dependence is similar to that of the absorption edge. At low temperatures an additional rotational minimum appears that is subject to the same red shift."
"The optical absorption coefficient for magnetic semiconductors has been calculated for indirect transitions in which the intraband scattering arises from an s-d or s-f exchange interaction instead of the usual phonon mechanism. The temperature and magnetic field dependence of the resulting absorption coefficient are discussed."
"This paper summarizes the recent investigations of photoinduced effects in magnetic materials. To date it has been shown that the uniaxial anisotropy, strain, linear dichroism, coercive force and initial permeability can be modified by infrared radiation. The theory interpreting the coercive force and permeability experiments differs from the model used to describe the first three effects and is not discussed here. The first three effects can be interpreted fairly well in terms of a model which has single Fe2+ ions preferentially occupying inequivalent octahedral sites. It is shown that with polarized light more than half of the available Fe2+ ions can be selectively moved among specific types of sites. Irradiation with unpolarized light essentially leads to a distribution appropriate for thermal equilibrium at the temperature of the sample."

   "A series of passivating and masking films was developed and evaluated for use in a Ge planar transistor technology. In the search for satisfactory films, silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, silicon nitride and multilayer combinations of these films, as well as some doped and mixed-composition films, were studied. The films, formed by pyrolytic deposition or by sputtering, were evaluated and compared with respect to the following properties: etch rate; dopant masking; mechanical stress; oxygen, hydrogen and water permeability; stability with respect to elevated temperature electrical-bias stressing; and Ge-insulator interface electrical condition. The most important results of our experiments are the following: Silicon nitride appears to be the only satisfactory mask for Ga diffusions, although silicon dioxide is adequate for As, P and Sb diffusion masking. The dielectric properties of pyrolytically deposited SiO2 can be made to approach those of thermal SiO2 by high temperature densification. The surface electrical properties of the Ge-SiO2 interface are more stable to thermal annealing than is any other Ge-insulator combination. However, aluminum oxide has been shown to be much less permeable to oxygen, hydrogen and water vapor than is SiO2. Since the Ge-insulator interface electrical properties are sensitive to these ambient gases, a satisfactory passivating film structure for Ge consists of an underlayer of SiO2 and an overlayer of Al2O3, silicon nitride or other relatively impermeable film."
"This is a survey of methods of analysis of the hot-electron phenomenon in semiconductors. The earliest method depended on three basic assumptions: smallness of the deviation of ƒ(p), the carrier distribution function, from ƒ0(E(p)), the distribution in energy E; the conventional relaxation-time relation between ƒ − ƒ0 and dƒ0/dE; and smallness of dƒ0/dE. More general methods are associated with giving up, successively in the reverse order, these assumptions. Procedures for obtaining and solving equations involving ƒ0 only, based on a new approach due to Levinson, are developed. An inherently precise method for calculating f and related treatment of differential mobility, which requires computer implementation and which has recently come into use, is expounded. Test calculations for the case of n-germanium are reported."
"A method is described for implementing real-time far-infrared Fourier spectroscopy in a time-shared environment. The system makes use of the IBM 1800 TSX-based General Experimental Monitor (GEM) and reduces by at least an order of magnitude the time between experiment initiation and the display of useful spectral frequency and intensity information. The key feature of the system includes conversational mode operation with the incomplete data array. This feature enables one to review at any interval the Fourier transform of the partially acquired data without in any way disturbing the process of data collection. Procedures are illustrated also for performing signal averaging and several comparatively routine spectroscopic tasks."
"Holland developed certain equations to be used to accelerate or induce convergence in multicomponent distillation calculations. In practice this procedure has been the most successful of any adjunct to the basic Thiele-Geddes or Lewis-Matheson procedure for solving these problems. It is of importance, therefore, to ascertain the conditions under which the Holland equations can be guaranteed to possess the required type of solution at each iteration. The types of specifications which fulfill these conditions are determined."
"The maximum likelihood principle of estimation applied to the linear black-box identification problem gives models with theoretically attractive properties. Also, the method has been applied to industrial data (various processes in paper production) and proved able to work in practice. This paper presents further developments of the method in the case of a single output. The reliability and speed of the identification algorithm have been improved, and the method has been made easier to use. A rather sophisticated computer program, however, was needed. It employs a generalized model structure, an improved hill-climbing algorithm, and an automatic procedure for determining model orders and transport delays. Some statistics from performance tests of the program are presented."
"When SiO2 is deposited by sputtering in an argon rf glow discharge, the films so produced contain considerable amounts of trapped argon, as determined by x-ray fluorescence analysis. This argon content was measured as a function of various sputtering parameters: argon pressure, rf power, electrode spacing, substrate temperature, and magnetic field, the latter two being most influential. A simple theoretical model for the capture and release of argon is presented which explains an observed linear decrease of the argon concentration in SiO2 with increasing temperature. Incorporation of argon into the sputtered SiO2 film does not seem to impair the film's ability to act as a good passivating and insulating layer."
"We consider a one-dimensional periodic potential, or “superlattice,” in monocrystalline semiconductors formed by a periodic variation of alloy composition or of impurity density introduced during epitaxial growth. If the period of a superlattice, of the order of 100 Å, is shorter than the electron mean free path, a series of narrow allowed and forbidden bands is expected due to the subdivision of the Brillouin zone into a series of minizones. If the scattering time of electrons meets a threshold condition, the combined effect of the narrow energy band and the narrow wave-vector zone makes it possible for electrons to be excited with moderate electric fields to an energy and momentum beyond an inflection point in the E-k relation; this results in a negative differential conductance in the direction of the superlattice. The study of superlattices and observations of quantum mechanical effects on a new physical scale may provide a valuable area of investigation in the field of semiconductors."
"The two-dimensional boundary value problem appropriate to current flow in a film resistor is examined. A simple closed-form solution for current density into the contact is found to exist for the important case of a thin film resistor with extended lands. The spatial dependence of the current density into the contact is found to be similar to that obtained by Kennedy and Murley for the diffused resistor, with film thickness entering the functional dependence in a role analogous to the diffusion length of the dopant ion in the diffused resistor."
"In a number of electronic manufacturing and testing applications, such as the testing of terminal-to-case resistance in microelectronic components, the use of a conducting liquid as an electrode in room-temperature applications offers several advantages over other methods of making electrical contact. Solid electrodes, including matrices of point contacts and area-contact materials such as metal foil or metal shot, are quite limited in their ability to conform to the surfaces of very small components, and a metal such as mercury that is liquid at room temperature is an obviously preferable choice. Liquid mercury exhibits high electrical conductivity, a high surface tension (which prevents wetting of component surfaces), and chemical stability; it is unreactive with the epoxies, phenolic plastics and other materials commonly found in electronic devices and requires a minimum of recurring set-up time in a test environment. In pure form, however, mercury does have an appreciable vapor pressure and its vapor is quite toxic; concentrations in air of 0.1 mg/m3 are immediately poisonous and concentrations as small as 0.001 mg/m3 are dangerous under conditions of prolonged exposure.1 Liquid alloys of mercury usually have an appreciably lower vapor pressure, but the choice of alloying metal must be made with care in order to avoid compromising the more desirable properties of the mercury. Gallium, for example, is very reactive and corrosive to most metals2 and thallium, while very soluble in mercury, is corrosive, very toxic, and tends to wet surfaces."

"THE CONTENTS of this issue are a bit unusual, consisting of two technical articles, two T & M notes, one book review, and a portion of a forthcoming book. However, for those of our readers who like to go through an issue of this Transactions from cover to cover, there is plenty to keep them busy (if they have finished the November issue, which had nine technical articles)."
"Reports a research study that attempted to determine whether top management positions within a specific organization are compatible with management science techniques. A questionnaire was employed to test the feasibility of introducing specific management science concepts. The results and recommendations of the study are included. It is hoped that the methodology reported, especially the questionnaire design, will be of use in future related research."
"Reports a field study situation where organizational change created conditions tantamount to a natural experiment on the relationship of leadership behaviour pattern to group morale and productivity. A formerly undifferentiated group was divided so that half the personnel remained under the control of their former leader, while half the personnel were placed under the control of a new leader. Whereas the former leader had been relatively permissive in behaviour, the new leader was autocratic and directive. Productivity was measured by publication rate, and morale indicated by turnover rate. Observational and interview data provided support. It was found that autocratic leadership had an immediate effect in lowering morale and productivity in the group directly under this form of control; after a short time lag, morale and productivity also suffered in the group of scientists not under autocratic control, but working in the same environment."
"Editor's Note: We are pleased to present, as a service to our readers, the preface and bibliographic reference portions of a forthcoming anthology on R&D management.

"In various nations, historical changes of an industrial structure (i.e., proportions of primary, secondary, and tertiary industry) are observed in trilinear coordinates where labour force distribution among the three industries and normalized relative incomes are plotted as examples. Necessity is pointed out of some qualitative change in industry, rather than a mere expansion of secondary industry in size, for the attainment of the higher standard of living in a broad sense. It is suggested that future policy in industrialization of a nation may be decided to an extent from the present status of the nation in the figures."
"In an increasingly competitive industry, R & D and Marketing are the twin pivots of success. The abstract nature of R & D and the overwhelming importance of engineering-based industries combine to make the ingredients of the successful R & D engineer both elusive and sought after. In order to increase his effectiveness, the present-day R & D engineer must combine specialized engineering expertise with comprehensive marketing and management capabilities. These traits are particularly difficult to achieve for the average engineer whose very training appears to inhibit balanced growth. But the success of the entrepreneurial trend is witness to those engineers who make the grade."

"THREE of the articles in this issue revolve about a common theme, management decision making. This has been a recurrent theme in this Transactions, not because of the amount of time managers actually spend on making decisions, but of the importance of this management function for the organization and its effectiveness and survival. Indeed, people conducting studies of the behavior and time-expenditure patterns of managers often have difficulty detecting actual decisionmaking acts, although we know that many decisions are being made continually. Much time is reported and observed to be spent, on the other hand, in preparing for decision making and recovering from the effects of bad decisions."
"This paper delineates some basic authority relationships within five models of project management: (1) the individual model; (2) the staff model; (3) the intermix model; (4) the aggregate model; and (5) the NASA/Apollo model. The authority construct is broken down into formal authority (authority inherent with the position and organizationally derived) and influence (authority generated by the project manager through his own technical competence and his administrative skills). The focus of this paper explains how the bases and functions of authority tend to shift within the various project-management models. An examination of the project manager's use of formal authority and influence in varying project contexts eliminates some of the ambiguity surrounding the concept of project authority."
"Research programs often require conventional electrical equipment components of exceptional performance characteristics. These are generally obtained by awarding a research and development contract. To avoid the usual difficulties of R&D contracts (high cost, delay, proprietary rights, patents, etc.) the Electronics Engineering Department of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory achieves such high-performance units by competitive, fixed-price purchase of several experimental components produced according to specified improvements in design or fabrication."
"The management of research-type activities is different from traditional management tasks because management direction is not essential to the conduct of the activity. For this reason, management often finds itself in a position where it cannot make significant contributions toward the usefulness of research-type activities. Decision-making as applied to management contributions toward the success of research and advanced development is discussed using a framework borrowed from statistical decision theory."
"This paper is based upon a survey of the scientists and engineers (S&E) in field research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) activities of the Department of Defense, primarily laboratories, test centers and ranges. These activities do not include headquarters or system/project offices. The information was provided by individual scientists and engineers and was forwarded by the organizations involved to the Office for Laboratory Management, Office of the Director of Defense Research and Engineering. The effective date of the information is September 1, 1968."
"Forecasting is a very important tool that can aid management in its decision-making process. Many managers have no confidence whatsoever in forecasts, while others, thinking them to be infallible, may depend too much on them. This note attempts to describe and explain the complexities of the interaction between forecasting and the management decision-making process. Some generalized concepts on evolution are discussed, and the limitations of forecasts pointed out. Suggestions are also made about the evaluation of forecasts, where they should be used, and how they may be used so as to maximize their benefits."

"TWO of the articles in this issue deal with a problem that is receiving increased, but still not enough attention in RD&E management. This is the problem of estimation and prediction of costs, success, time-to-completion, and other uncertain characteristics of RD&E projects. Although analysts and students of the R&D process, such as Doering and Ebert, have increased their efforts to provide analytical methods for treating this essential area of management, their efforts unfortunately, are not being matched by practicing RD&E managers. Although the underlying theory and analytical techniques for handling estimates and subjective probabilities are far from being complete or perfect, there is a significant implementation gap on the management side with respect to 1) influencing estimators to provide more adequate estimates and 2) devoting their own efforts to further improving and developing the techniques for effectively generating and using estimates in project proposals and reviews. In other words, there is a severe implementation gap in our ability to improve RD&E estimating. It is, of course, not merely a matter of using improved analytical (mathematical or statistical) methods. The problems involve deep psychological and social-psychological factors such as individual risk-taking, group decision-making, organizational power relationships, individual competence and judgment, etc. Our state of basic knowledge about these factors is increasing rapidly as a result of academic research, and what is needed now is vastly increased effort on the part of management to develop this knowledge further by empirical and experimental means, so that it can be transformed into routine management tools for project selection and estimation. It is not a quick or cheap process, but in an era of shrinking R&D budgets and public disillusionment with R&D, it is an essential job that must be done."
"This paper develops a model that can be used to predict a potential variance from planned schedule for a given R&D task. The task is defined as the net increase in knowledge required to move from the initial level of basic knowledge about the problem to the level specified for its accomplishment. Variables are identified that affect the time required for attainment of successive knowledge- state levels, assuming that an adequate technical solution is feasible and adequate funds are available. The variables are defined and evaluated for sixteen historical R&D tasks from an industrial laboratory through use of comparative value estimation techniques, and a correlation-regression analysis is performed with time as the dependent variable. This information is used to structure a predictive model for time to attain intermediate knowledge states given values for the variables associated with these subactivities. Total task time is obtained by addition of predicted times to attain the intermediate knowledge states. The predicted task time is normally distributed with variance including variance and covariance of the intermediate knowledge-state times. The validity of the model is tested on a task representative of a laboratory activity beginning in its planning stage and continuing through the knowledge states of design concept, design, unit assembly, and developing the unit. Faced with evaluation of a new R&D task, management can then determine the optimum method to lower the risk commensurate with its goals/objectives by reassignment of resources or developing alternative technical approaches."
"There is currently a national furore over the way large military programs are managed. Some of it is politically or journalistically inspired. But some of it reflects a genuine disagreement over how these programs should be controlled. This paper presents a number of issues involved in the disagreement and develops the thesis that two diverging camps are being formed on their resolution: one focused on resources and the other on products. It then concludes that because there is much merit to the argument presented on both sides of many of these issues, the direction that must be taken in the program-control field is not to attempt to resolve the individual issues directly; rather it is to deal with root causes that can accommodate both points of view. It then offers a sample of three suggestions in this regard."
"In this paper the matrix model of an R&D organization developed by Dean (1967) has been extended to organizations with mixed global objectives based on a graph-theoretic formulation. The extended model can be applied to problems like the maximization of R&D outputs of a number of organizations at the level of either a corporation or a country such that a specified growth in the overall research competence of the entire corporation or the country is maintained."
"This paper discloses some `rules of thumb' developed by the author in order to better assign engineering talent to small R&D programs. The philosophy to support the empirically derived equations is covered in the paper. A case history to demonstrate the efficacy of the rules of thumb is discussed."
"Subjective probability estimates underly many decision techniques and project evaluation methods used in R&D. Recent research efforts of others in the study of subjective probability have resulted in methodological developments that may have useful R&D context. It is suggested that such may improve personal probability assessments, and, under some circumstances, may be useful in evaluating the relative assessment performances of the different assessors."
"Historically, where a computer programming group is part of a diversified company there has been a gap between the management and the programming group itself. This gap has been fostered by both a lack of understanding, on management's part, of the Intricacies of programming and the attitude of many programmers who consider their work to be an art as opposed to a science. This gap has led to higher costs for implementing a job and loss of control on management's part, along with frustration and sloppy work habits on the programmers' part. Even in many software houses, inefficiencies exist due to the lack of proper training of programmers in managerial positions. It is the extent of this paper to bridge this gap. In addition, the paper attempts to provide various check lists required by managers to guide software projects."

"THE papers in this issue demonstrate the broad range of subjects and methods of presentation within the area of engineering management. The ubiquitous concern with systems engineering has, in recent issues, been represented by papers on specific topics. Hill's paper presents an overall view that will be a useful reference for readers who have somehow missed the extensive literature on the subject."
"The systems engineering approach provides an increasingly widespread and pervasive integrative framework for modern systems analysis and management practice. Systems engineering methodology stems primarily from extensive experience in the development and management of highly complex large scale military systems by the Department of Defense. An attempt is made in this paper to present a background on the evolution of the systems engineering process and to synthesize a more complete resolution than is generally available in the literature. Hopefully this understanding will contribute to current and potential applications of systems engineering procedures for technological, social, industrial, and governmental purposes."
"The causes and consequences of disrupted startups of new product and production processes are examined in relation to examples drawn from several, diverse industries. It is demonstrated that inappropriate management actions can often precipitate significant deviations from expected patterns of productivity increases during startups, resulting in important short- and long-run productivity losses. Based upon the discussion, several guidelines for effective startup management are suggested."
"There sometimes arises in R&D (and other) management the necessity to revise the current allocation of R&D money among projects because of a decrement in the total budget appropriated for research. What is usually required in such circumstances is a quick computational procedure (though not necessarily 100 percent accurate) based on a minimum of input data. New constraints expressing minimum funding to be given to each project so as to maintain stability in personnel or satisfy prior commitments must also be taken into consideration. A simple algorithm is developed on the assumption that the current allocation is optimal at the original budget level. Using the Kuhn-Tucker theory in nonlinear programming, it is shown that this algorithm reaches the revised optimal solution in a finite number of iterations."
"An examination by the authors of the complexity of business decision making led to the conclusion that an organized information gathering and analysis mechanism is necessary to cope with this complexity. In this paper a proposed structure of the decision-making process is presented in the context of an R&D organization engaged in many different technical programs and projects. The foundation of this structure is an effective management team. On this foundation rest the main supports of the structure, which include a model representing the R&D process, a technological forecasting scheme to provide an indication of future direction, the project proposing and planning activities to provide the technical information needed for decision making, a set of quantitized judgments to which analytic tools can be applied, an algorithm for optimum resource allocation, and finally, a hybrid decision-making technique. An experiment has been performed with this method and the result, through not reported here, was very encouraging."
"This note defines software, lists examples, establishes a basis for software management, and recommends implementation of management by the establishment of an Associate Program Manager with the total software responsibility.

"The performance of several burst-trapping codes has been estimated through computer simulation on three sets of field trial data over the switched telephone network (Alexander-Gryb-Nast, Townsend-Watts, Vestigial-Sideband). The results indicate that the codes are capable of giving better performance than interleaved codes based on the same coding redundancy and approximately the same storage requirement."
"This paper presents an analysis technique for determining upper and lower bounds on the performance of a burst-trapping error control procedure. The analysis is valid for random, burst, or compound channels provided that a block interleaving degree ℓ ≧ 1 can be found for the channel such that error patterns in blocks spaced ℓ blocks apart occur approximately independently. Good agreement is achieved between the theoretical performance of codes on telephone channels and the performance obtained by computer simulation."
"In this paper, we study a number of stochastic models including stationary, nonstationary, and linear processes for the purpose of simulating earthquake- or explosion-induced ground motions. The important statistical characteristics of each model and their effects on structural systems are investigated in some detail. We obtain expressions for the mean-square response of simple linear mass-spring oscillators to each model. We discuss numerical procedures for time series simulations of these models. The objectives of this paper are (i) to examine and compare the statistical properties and effects on structures of all possible stochastic processes applicable to model ground motions and (ii) to offer engineers a basis for forming their own judgments."
"We investigate the steady-state probability density distribution of a large class of random processes by solving the governing Fokker-Planck equation. The random response statistics of a nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom mechanical model with hyperbolic tangent stiffness are discussed in some detail. The probability density of such systems is of the sech-power type which belongs to a class of distributions whose behaviors are carefully examined at the limits where the system parameter b approaches zero and infinity. Other important response statistics such as the mean square response, zero crossings, and peak distributions are also studied."
"We performed three laboratory experiments of crosstalk thresholds using simulated telephone conversations. Two of these experiments involved masking of crosstalk by noise; the third involved masking of crosstalk by both noise and primary speech. In this paper, we present intelligibility and detectability threshold data from these experiments and discuss the usefulness of the intelligibility threshold data for determining telephone crosstalk objectives. In general, the crosstalk threshold versus masking noise functions obtained from these experiments agreed fairly well with similar functions published earlier. These functions were found to be linear for high values of noise (about 20 dBrnC and higher) and markedly nonlinear for lower values of noise. For very low noise conditions (about 5–6 dBrnC or lower), crosstalk thresholds were almost independent of noise. Intelligibility thresholds were found to be 8–10 dB higher than the corresponding detectability thresholds and a difference of the same size was found between threshold values obtained (i) with background noise and (ii) with both background noise and background speech."
 "In this paper we describe a new semiconductor device concept. Basically, it consists of storing charge in potential wells created at the surface of a semiconductor and moving the charge (representing information) over the surface by moving the potential minima. We discuss schemes for creating, transferring, and detecting the presence or absence of the charge. In particular, we consider minority carrier charge storage at the Si-SiO2 interface of a MOS capacitor. This charge may be transferred to a closely adjacent capacitor on the same substrate by appropriate manipulation of electrode potentials. Examples of possible applications are as a shift register, as an imaging device, as a display device, and in performing logic."
"Structures have been fabricated consisting of closely spaced MOS capacitors on an n-type silicon substrate. By forming a depletion region under one of the electrodes, minority carriers (holes) may be stored in the resulting potential well. This charge may then be transferred to an adjacent electrode by proper manipulation of electrode potentials. The assumption that this transfer will take place in reasonable times with a small fractional loss of charge is the basis of the charge coupled devices described in the preceding paper,1 To test this assumption, devices were fabricated and measurements made. Charge transfer efficiencies greater than 98 percent for transfer times less than 100 nsec were observed."
"This paper examines the distribution of the mantissas of floating point numbers and shows how the arithmetic operations of a computer transform various distributions toward the limiting distribution $r(x) = {1 \\over x \\ln b} \\quad (1/b \\leqq x \\leqq 1)$ (where b is the base of the number system). The paper also gives a number of applications to hardware, software, and general computing which show that this distribution is not merely an amusing curiosity. A brief examination of the distribution of exponents is included."
"In this paper, we initiate a study into the combinatorial aspects of a model of the interactions between discrete magnetic domains and their potential use in information processing devices. Starting with a simple model suggested by W. Shockley, we demonstrate certain (surprising) capabilities as well as inherent limitations upon the possible applications of the interactions described by this model. It should be noted that this simple model does not take into account all of the possible interactions between magnetic domains."
"We find the field configurations and the propagation constants of the guided modes in a dielectric waveguide with curved axis and rectangular cross-section. Outside the guide, the refractive index is uniform. Inside, the index profile in the radial direction (intersection of the meridional plane and the plane of curvature) follows a parabolic law with the maximum at the center of the guide; in the direction perpendicular to the plane of curvature the index is either uniform or parabolic, again with the maximum at the center of the guide. The guide with mixed profiles has been proposed as an easy-to-support, low-loss, ribbon-like guide for millimeter and optical waves while the other, with parabolic profile in both directions, is similar to the “SELFOC®” or “GRIN” image transmitting guides. The axial field components are small compared to the transverse components and consequently the modes are almost of the TEM kind. Within the guide the field distribution along a quadratic profile is a parabolic cylinder function of order close to an integer, and is sinusoidal along the uniform profile. The field components outside of the guide decay almost with exponential law. Inside the SELFOC-like guide, the field distribution of the fundamental mode is gaussian and except for the attenuation the characteristics of the beam are similar to those obtained for a guide in which the parabolic index profile is not truncated. The attenuation constant α of any mode is very sensitive to the radius of curvature R. Doubling R reduces α by several orders of magnitude. Fixing R and the difference of refractive index between the center of the guide and the edge of it, the attenuation constant α passes through a minimum for a guide width measured in the plane of curvature which is only a few beam-widths. Radiation loss for the fundamental gaussian mode is negligibly small if the distance between the center of the beam and the edge of the guide is two or more half beam-widths. Guides with rectangular index profile in the plane of curvature have less radiation loss than similar guides with truncated parabolic profile."
"The radiation loss theory that has been developed in a series of earlier papers is extended to the dominant mode of the round dielectric waveguide. The theory is applied to the calculation of radiation losses of abrupt steps, gradual tapers, and random wall perturbations of the round dielectric waveguide. The radiation losses caused by an abrupt step, and consequently the losses of tapers, are far higher for the dominant mode of the round dielectric waveguide than they are for corresponding steps and tapers of the dielectric slab waveguide. However, the losses caused by infinitesimal random wall perturbations of the round waveguide are nearly equal to the random wall losses predicted on the basis of the slab waveguide theory. In fact the losses of the dominate mode as well as the circular electric TE01 mode of the round rod due to random wall perturbations are very nearly the same. The theory is limited to circular symmetric distortions of the round dielectric rod (diameter changes). The radiation losses caused by steps of the round dielectric waveguide that carries the dominate guided mode have been verified by experiments at millimeter wave frequencies."
"The excitation of the dominant HE11 mode of a round optical fiber by a gaussian beam has been calculated. The calculation is based on the assumption that reflected waves can be neglected. It is thus applicable only to fibers with low index difference between core and cladding. It is found that optimum excitation of the HE11 mode is achieved for loosely guided beams if the product of the beam half-width w times the radial decay constant γ of the HE11 mode outside of the guide is unity, γw = 1. For tightly coupled modes 2½w must be equal to the core radius in order to achieve optimum excitation. As much as 99 percent of the power can be transferred to the HE11 mode. Also investigated are the effects of an off-set or tilted beam on the mode excitation. The mode excitation drops to 36 percent if the amount of off-set equals the beam half-width. The effect of tilts depends on the parameter kd, free space propagation constant times core radius of the fiber. For small values of kd or loosely guided modes, the mode excitation is very sensitive to tilts of the gaussian beam. As long as the HE11 mode is the only mode that can propagate, increasing values of kd lead to less sensitivity with respect to tilts. For multimode operation of the fiber, the sensitivity to tilts increases with increasing values of kd. The minimum of tilt sensitivity coincides with the minimum spot size of the guided mode."
"In this paper we provide a rigorous proof that feedback cannot increase the capacity of the channel with additive colored gaussian noise by more than a factor of two. We also give a tighter bound showing that any increase in capacity is less than the normalized correlation between the signal and noise. It is further shown that gaussian signals and linear feedback processing will achieve capacity. The practical implications are that (i) feedback should be used to simplify encoding and decoding since there is little to be gained in the way of increased capacity and (ii) the various proposed schemes which use linear feedback are doing the correct thing."
"It has long been recognized that equations describing dc transistor networks do not necessarily have unique solutions. The Eccles-Jordan (flip-flop) circuit is an excellent example of one for which the dc equations may have more than one solution. Only recently, however, has a comprehensive theory concerning matters such as the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the dc equations of general transistor networks begun to take shape. This paper represents another contribution to the evolution of that theory. A key concept in the development of the recent theory is the concept of a “P0 matrix.” We give a generalization of that concept, showing that one can specify properties possessed by certain pairs of square matrices, analogous to the properties possessed by a single P0 matrix. Pairs of matrices possessing these properties are called W0 pairs. Use is made of this W0 pair concept to prove results which are more general than some of the existing ones. We provide an extension of much of the existing theory in such a manner that a broader class of dc transistor networks may be considered. In particular, the new results provide one with the ability to answer certain questions concerning the existence, uniqueness, boundedness, and so on, of solutions of the equations for any network which is comprised of transistors, diodes, resistors, and independent sources."
"We consider in detail the nonlinear equations encountered at each time step when certain implicit numerical-integration algorithms are used. In terms of only the properties of the Jacobian matrix of the pertinent set of differential equations, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the nonlinear equations for all continuous forcing functions and any given step size. Since engineers often think about dynamic nonlinear transistor network problems in terms of the eigenvalues of the relevant Jacobian matrix, the results described are of immediate conceptual value. In particular, it is possible to carry out the algorithms whenever the conditions presented are satisfied. Several other types of results are also presented. For example, for a special but significant and useful numerical-integration formula, theorems are proved concerning properties of the computed sequence such as the extent to which the sequence is relatively immune to small local errors introduced at each step as a result of the fact that it is ordinarily not possible to compute the solution of a certain equation exactly. All of the results are concerned with network models that are often used in computer simulations. In fact, we heavily exploit some special properties possessed by the nonlinear functions associated with such models."
"We discuss characterization of the tuned-harmonic mode of operation in IMPATT oscillators, and introduce an equivalent circuit which incorporates the large-signal, “single-frequency” oscillator admittances at the fundamental and second-harmonic frequencies. Complete characterization of this mode is equivalent to specifying the behavior of each of the four elements of the equivalent circuit as functions of the oscillation state variables: fundamental voltage and frequency, second-harmonic voltage and relative phase. Using the approximate large-signal analysis of Blue,1 the values of the equivalent circuit elements are presented, as an example, for a 6-GHz IMPATT diode under a variety of oscillation conditions. This equivalent circuit is used to clarify the role played by the fundamental and second-harmonic, single-frequency oscillator admittances in the tuned-harmonic mode. Using an approximation to the equivalent circuit, we investigate the criteria for stable oscillation of the tuned-harmonic mode. It is found that the stability criteria are in general quite restrictive. For the same 6-GHz germanium diode, the range of stable phase is investigated, as a function of the RF parameters, for certain special cases. It is found to be possible to satisfy the stability criteria for the phase which gives an optimum enhancement of the fundamental power output if certain conditions on the external RF circuit are satisfied."
"We analyze in this paper the performance of adaptive retransmission for improving two-way communication between antenna arrays in a randomly fading environment. For a stationary environment, S. P. Morgan has shown that complex conjugate retransmission reaches a stable state and maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio of a maximal ratio diversity reception system. We show that a simpler system using phase conjugate retransmission will also stabilize and maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of an equal gain diversity reception system. Where the fading is slow in comparison to the system settling-down time, both systems provide a significant improvement in transmission. Subject to Rayleigh fading, we have obtained the average signal strength and its cumulative probability distribution for various combinations of numbers of antennas in the two arrays for each of the above mentioned systems. This information is useful in choosing an optimal division of diversity branches for the two antenna arrays. It is further observed that although the phase conjugate retransmission system is much simpler to implement, its performance is only slightly inferior to the corresponding complex conjugate system."
"Amplitude measurements were made for 68 days in 1966 for seven 4-GHz and 6-GHz signals on a typical radio relay path. Identical measurements were also made for one 4-GHz signal on a second path having a common reception point with the first path. We present the results from an analysis centered on the fade-depth distribution for fades exceeding 20 dB. The more significant results are: (i) The fade-depth distribution for all single (nondiversity) channels in a 5–10 percent band on the same path are essentially the same. Further, the distribution has the Rayleigh slope. (ii) The single-channel fade-depth distributions differ for 4 and 6 GHz on the same path; the distributions also differ for the same 4-GHz frequency on adjacent paths with a common reception point. (iii) One-for-one frequency diversity can be characterized during multipath fading periods for either the 4- or 6-GHz bands by the ratio of two quantities. The first is the precent frequency separation between diversity components. The second is the nondiversity fade-depth distribution."
"In this paper we present tables which contain the Mie scattering coefficient, absorption coefficient, extinction coefficient, equivalent medium index of refraction and phase delay for rains conforming to the Laws and Parsons drop-size distribution. These transmission characteristics have been calculated for microwave frequencies of interest in common carrier radio relay systems, 300 to 1.43 GHz, that is, 0.1 to 21.0 cm, at rain rates from 0.25 to 150.0 mm/hr. We also include the extinction coefficients for the visible wavelength 0.6328 μ. The microwave tables were generated by using a Mie scattering computer program similar to that designed and previously reported by Deirmendjian. The calculations at 0.6328 μ were made separately by employing the usual assumptions for droplets with very large circumference to wavelength ratios."
"A linear phase modulator with a stable carrier frequency would be a useful component in radio systems — especially in coherent phase-shift-keyed PCM systems with baud rates of the order of 100 megabauds per second. The Armstrong modulator appears adequate for these applications; the circuit functions required for its realization are well understood and amenable to the techniques of integrated circuitry. In this paper, an analysis of the signal and distortion properties of the Armstrong circuit and variations of it are presented and applied to three system applications: as a replacement modulator for existing low-index analog systems; for multilevel coherent phase-shift-keyed PCM systems; and for frequency-division frequency-modulation multiplex systems which are of interest in radio trunk systems."
"In this paper it is established that for Lipschitz functional differential systems, the eventual uniform asymptotic stability of the origin is preserved under absolutely diminishing perturbations."
"For bandlimited functions, simultaneous approximation of a function and several of its derivatives is considered. Concomitant entropy estimates are obtained. A feasible algorithm for the transmission of information is discussed. This algorithm has been applied to the design of a class of PCM systems.1"
"The motions of satellites phased in particular, slightly inclined orbits are timed so that different satellites are north and south of the equator when sun-caused outages occur in geostationary equatorial systems."
"We describe in this paper a method for efficient encoding of speech signals, based on predictive coding. In this coding method, both the transmitter and the receiver estimate the signal's current value by linear prediction on the previously transmitted signal. The difference between this estimate and the true value of the signal is quantized, coded and transmitted to the receiver. At the receiver, the decoded difference signal is added to the predicted signal to reproduce the input speech signal. Because of the nonstationary nature of the speech signals, an adaptive linear predictor is used, which is readjusted periodically to minimize the mean-square error between the predicted and the true value of the signals. The predictive coding system was simulated on a digital computer. The predictor parameters, comprising one delay and nine other coefficients related to the signal spectrum, were readjusted every 5 milliseconds. The speech signal was sampled at a rate of 6.67 kHz, and the difference signal was quantized by a two-level quantizer with variable step size. Subjective comparisons with speech from a logarithmic PCM encoder (log-PCM) indicate that the quality of the synthesized speech signal from the predictive coding system is approximately equal to that of log-PCM speech encoded at 6 bits/sample. Preliminary studies suggest that the binary difference signal and the predictor parameters together can be transmitted at approximately 10 kilobits/second which is several times less than the bit rate required for log-PCM encoding with comparable speech quality."
 "R. L. Graham has discussed various combinatorial aspects of the behavior of magnetic domains or “bubbles“.1 Representing the initial state of a configuration of n magnetic domains by the n-tuple of indeterminates B = (X1, …, Xn), he showed that subsequent configurations of magnetic domains obtainable (within the constraints of the problem) correspond exactly to subsequent n-tuples of Boolean expressions in the Xi's∗ obtainable from B through an application to B of a product of transformations (“commands” in Ref. 1) of the form Tij(1 ≦ j … n) where if P = (P1, …, Pn) is an n-tuple of Boolean expressions in the Xi's, then Tij(P) = (Q1 …, Qn), $Q_{k} = \\left\\{\\matrix{P_{i} \\cup P_{i} & {\\rm if} & k = i \\cr P_{i} \\cap P_{i} & {\\rm if} & k = j \\cr P_{k} & {\\rm otherwise}}\\right\\}, \\quad k = 1,\\cdots, n.$."
"Signal characteristics of the silicon diode array used as the image sensing element of the Picturephone® camera tube have been studied using a numerical computation. Analytical representation of the target is based on the numerical calculation of the depletion region geometry for an array diode unit-cell undergoing discharge. This analysis includes the effects of Si-SiO2 fixed interface charge density, sea resistance, substrate resistivity, P+ island geometry, and SiO2-Si surface inversion phenomenon. Computed depletion region geometries are used to calculate surface and bulk contributions to array dark current. It is shown that signal current limitations due to surface inversion can be avoided using lower values of sea resistance coupled with higher SiO2-Si interface fixed charge density. For the resistive sea target structure, inversion effects are less pronounced for targets fabricated with P+ islands larger than 10 μm diameter and sea sheet resistances less than 1014 ohms per square. This signal limiting effect can also be eliminated by using a conductive overlay structure. Results of analyses of lag characteristics and electron beam limitations are also presented."
"Thin plates of ferroelectric ceramic in combination with transparent conductive and photoconductive films have been used to form device structures that can store a real image as a spatial variation in birefringence. This image can be viewed directly by suitably polarized transmitted light or projected onto a viewing screen. The stored image is erasable by the application of appropriate combinations of light and electric fields."
"M. R. Schroeder recently proposed a scheme for compression of motion picture data by taking the difference of two successive frames and then smearing.1 The smearing is accomplished by a Hadamard matrix. If the Hadamard matrix is of a certain particularly well-understood type, then we show that if the input differential picture consists of a small odd number of large pulses of identical magnitudes (but arbitrary signs), then the output will consist of three components: (i) Large pulses of equal magnitude and the correct signs, matching each of the input pulses. (ii) One additional “stray” large pulse, of magnitude equal to the others, but located at a point where the input was zero. (iii) Scatlered pulses of amplitude low relative to the pulses of types i and ii, but so numerous that they consume (π − 2)/π of the total energy of the output differential picture. We give an explicit formula for the amplitude of each of these pulses. The problem of determining Ihe distributions of all possible outputs of the proposed system for other classes of inputs is shown to be equivalent to the unsolved problem of finding the weight enumerators for the cosets of the first order Reed-Muller codes."
"A cyclic code is an ideal in the group algebra of a special kind of Abelian group, namely a cyclic group. Many properties of cyclic codes are special cases of properties of ideals in an Abelian group algebra. A character of an Abelian group G of order v is, for our purposes, a homomorphism of G into the group of vth roots of unity over GF(2). If G is cyclic with generator x, the character is entirely determined by what it does to x; this effect is kept, and the characters are discarded. If G is not cyclic it is necessary to rehabilitate the characters. Without them the notation is impossible; with them one can prove a number of theorems which reduce in the special case to well-known properties of cyclic codes. Moreover the writer thinks that the general proof is often easier and more suggestive than the proof for the special case. To support this point of view we produce a new theorem, which of course also applies to cyclic codes."
"A highly integrable delta modulation codec design, for applications where transmission bandwidth is not at a premium but where an inexpensive and high quality converter is desired, is considered in this paper. An asymmetrical codec integrator is used to improve quantizing noise characteristics. Charge parceling techniques which are used for performing the integrating function, offer advantage over conventional RC integrators."
"It is well known that protection against additive gaussian noise can be obtained in m-ary digital modulation systems by expanding bandwidth or by increasing the channel signal-to-noise ratio. It is also well known that arbitrarily small error probabilities can be attained in digital systems by using long and complex encoding and decoding procedures. Based on the results of Shannon and Slepian, we derive for an optimal system lower bounds to the channel signal-to-noise ratio for various probabilities of error, for various bandwidth expansions, and for a processing interval not greater than the signaling interval of the source. It is assumed that all m characters have equal a priori probabilities and that maximum likelihood detection is used in the receiver. For a bandwidth expansion of two, and for equal energy code words, we also show that the performance of a coherent phase-shift keyed system is as good as that of the optimal system."
"We present in this paper transit-time variations in line-of-sight propagation paths and systems operating at frequencies up to 30 GHz. We discuss variations due to both atmospheric changes (no precipitation) and rain and point out some relationships to PCM systems."
"In this paper, we analyze single-sideband amplitude-modulation digital communication systems to develop a method for jointly and optimally setting the carrier phase and the automatic transversal equalizer of such systems. Mean-square equalization error is used as the performance criterion. We develop a simple receiver structure and study the convergence of the method. Exact locations of the stationary points in the parameter space are determined and the classifications of the stationary points are obtained. We show that the mean-square equalization error has only global minima and saddlepoints, but not local minima and maxima. Thus, the mean-square equalization error will converge to the absolute minimum by the proposed method, regardless of the initial settings of the parameters. A simple condition on the step sizes of the adjustments is also obtained which ensures the convergence of the process. Explicit formulas of the joint optimum parameter settings and of the corresponding minimum mean-square error are obtained. For illustration purposes, a single-sideband digital communication system using a five- or nine-tap transversal equalizer is simulated on a computer. Both theory and simulation show that the equalization error depends critically on the carrier phase when the number of equalizer taps is not large, and that the minimum equalization error can be obtained by using the proposed method."
"In this paper we approach twin-T design with a view to controlling the sensitivity of the transmission zero with respect to component variations, according to criteria that are of particular interest in the design of hybrid integrated linear active networks. We give design examples and derive conditions that relate null depth and component characteristics with expected zero displacement in the s-plane."
"Presently used substrates for integrated circuit chip mounting and interconnection provide limited heat sink capability and preclude the effective use of matched impedance transmission line interconnection. These characteristics can be improved by the use of very narrow microstrip lines on thin dielectric layers backed by thermally and electrically conductive material. We propose a model for calculating the effective thermal resistance of layered substrates and make calculations for a variety of materials. The thermal problem is considered for heat extraction either through the edge or through the face of the substrate. Improvements in substrate thermal conductance of an order of magnitude appear realizable compared to presently used substrates (for example, 0.625 mm alumina). We analyze the electrical parameters of narrow (0.02–0.1 mm) microstrip lines on coated substrates in the frequency range 10 MHz to 10 GHz. The characteristic impedance, propagation delay time, and attenuation are found to be frequency dependent, and efforts to minimize this frequency dependence by magnetic loading result in greater, though more constant, delay times. Losses may be significant (∼2–5 dB/cm in many cases), but short line lengths due to dense circuit packing allowed by improved heat dissipating capability will minimize this disadvantage."
"Near the edge of a charged electrode on the surface of a semiconductor, the field in the semiconductor may become very large because of the accumulation of charge at the electrode edge. Such large local fields are undesirable, not only because they may cause local breakdown, but also because they make the behavior of a semiconductor device difficult to predict. In the present paper we consider a simple mathematical model of an electrode edge-semiconductor-insulator configuration and derive conditions under which large local fields may be avoided. More accurately, since the electrode edge and semiconductor corner angles are assumed to be perfectly sharp, we derive conditions under which the local field in the semiconductor is nonsingular. It is necessary to include the effect of the surrounding insulator, because even for small insulator-semiconductor dielectric constant ratios, a field singularity in the insulator will be coupled back into the semiconductor."
"In this paper we describe methods for determining the cross-sectional area function of the human vocal tract from acoustical measurements made at one end. The pressure and volume velocity are assumed to obey Webster's horn equation, which is valid for frequencies below 3.5 kHz. Acoustical properties below 3.5 kHz do not uniquely specify the area function. This paper shows how high frequency information may be incorporated into the mathematical model in a manner consistent with a priori information about the vocal tract. Some results of application of the methods by computer simulation are presented. It is interesting to see from the figures that nine numbers (namely, length, four formants, and four residues) specify the area function quite well for practical purposes."
"In this paper, the current distribution on a bare conducting loop, situated in free space over a semi-infinite medium, is obtained for arbitrary time harmonic excitations. The loop is assumed to be thin, perfectly conducting and the standard one-dimensional integral equation and its Fourier series solution are used as the starting points. The field due to the current in the loop, where the semi-infinite medium is absent, is expressed as a superposition of plane waves. The tangential component of the field reflected by the interface, of the semi-infinite medium, is evaluated using appropriate Fresnel reflection coefficients. This reflected field serves as a new source for the loop and induces a current on the loop. The field due to the induced current is treated in the same manner, and this process is repeated indefinitely. The summation of the original current and all the induced currents gives the steady-state current on the loop."
 "Data from the Crawford Hill sun tracker have confirmed the expectation that frequencies above about 10 GHz experience large attenuations on an earth-space path when heavy rain is encountered.1 Tillotson has proposed using frequencies of about 20 and 30 GHz for a domestic communication satellite system.2 In that case, the required continuity of service would be achieved by using two or more diversity ground stations. The three-radiometer path-diversity experiment discussed here was designed to work in conjunction with the sun tracker to determine the advantage of diversity ground station pairs at these frequencies."
"Consideration is being given to the use of frequencies well above 10 GHz for satellite communication. One of the problems encountered in the use of these high frequencies is the attenuation caused by precipitation. A considerable amount of pertinent data has been obtained in the 16- and 30-GHz sun tracker and 16-GHz radiometer programs underway at the Crawford Hill Laboratory.1,2 From the data obtained from radiometer measurements, one may calculate the attenuation expected on an earth-space path. Such attenuation calculations have been shown to be in good agreement with sun tracker measurements.1 The present experiment was designed to check further the validity of the radiometer results by a direct comparison of the data obtained from a 16-GHz radiometer with the attenuation measured by transmission from a the afternoon of April 24, 1970. The peak measured 15.3-GHz signal attenuation and the corresponding 16-GHz radiometer record were 9.8 dB and 10.6 dB respectively.)"
"P/AR stands for peak-to-average ratio. The instrumentation to measure this ratio has been assembled and obtains a single number evaluation to the dispersion in a transmission medium by measuring the peak and the full wave rectified average of a pulse stream.1,2"
"The interaction between the roundoff-noise output from a digital filter and the associated dynamic-range limitations is investigated for the case of uncorrelated rounding errors from sample to sample and from one error source to another. The required dynamic-range constraints are derived in terms of Lp norms of the input-signal spectrum and the transfer responses to selected nodes within the filter. The concept of “transpose configurations” is introduced and is found to be quite useful in digital-filter synthesis; for although such configurations have identical transfer functions, their roundoff-noise outputs and dynamic-range limitations can be quite different, in general. Two transpose configurations for the direct form of a digital filter are used to illustrate these results."
"This paper presents a procedure for decomposing an nth order filter into cascadable second order sections. The procedure is optimal in that it minimizes the maximal response range for the sections within the frequency band of interest. The procedure, based on a modified version of the Bottleneck Assignment Algorithm, describes methods of listing all the optimal decompositions as well as of finding a special “nested” optimal decomposition."
"We give experimental verification, for idle-channel and sinusoidal inputs, of a recently developed quantizing noise theory for asymmetrical, single-integration delta-modulators."
"This paper considers the application of a digital computer and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) techniques to the measurement of signals known to comprise only single-frequency tones. We discuss the use of weighting functions to improve the effective selectivity of a measurement system that estimates the frequencies and levels of tones from the coefficients of their DFT. We present three classes of weighting functions which may be used to improve the inherent accuracy of such a system. The form of the weighting functions was chosen to minimize the amount of computer memory required, without using too much computer time. Several formulas are derived for estimating the frequency and level of a tone from its DFT coefficients. We chose the formulas to minimize computation time. Simulation results indicate that, through the use of a proper weighting function, a DFT measurement system that uses 512 samples taken at a sampling frequency of 7040 Hz can be designed so that the maximum error in the frequency estimates of two tones near 1000 Hz and separated by approximately 50 Hz is about 0.03 Hz. The corresponding maximum error in the level estimate is on the order of 0.03 dB."
"A series of switches using a miniature dry-reed sealed contact in a cable switch configuration has been developed to provide switching capability from dc to 100 MHz. We present a description of the development, performance characteristics, and mechanical design features."
"This paper presents an experimental study of the oscillations set up in a circuit consisting of a negative conductance and a multiple-resonant load. Its purpose was to verify that such a circuit can account for many of the irregular phenomena commonly observed during tuning of practical microwave solid-state oscillators; such effects as discontinuous frequency changes, low circuit Q-factors, power variations, spurious oscillations and noise conditions are all readily reproduced in a simple low-frequency analogue. There is close correspondence with a first-order analysis."
"In this paper we calculate radiation losses of a single mode dielectric slab waveguide for TE and TM modes. The theory is based on the determination of the radiation losses of one abrupt step. We obtain the losses of arbitrarily deformed waveguides by regarding the arbitrary deformations as a succession of infinitely many infinitesimal steps. This method yields the same results as a very different method presented earlier. It allows us to calculate the losses of TM modes that were hard to obtain by the earlier method. The radiation losses of single mode slab waveguides with abrupt steps of a 2:1 ratio are surprisingly low and can be kept below 1 percent by dimensioning the guide properly. The loss advantage of linear tapers becomes noticeable only when the tapers are very long. An optimized taper changes more rapidly in its wider portion and becomes more gradual in its narrow part."
"We consider the problem of partitioning the nodes of a graph with costs on its edges into subsets of given sizes so as to minimize the sum of the costs on all edges cut. This problem arises in several physical situations — for example, in assigning the components of electronic circuits to circuit boards to minimize the number of connections between boards. This paper presents a heuristic method for partitioning arbitrary graphs which is both effective in finding optimal partitions, and fast enough to be practical in solving large problems."
"We represent by an electrical model the imaging of a one-dimensional coherently illuminated and diffusely reflecting surface by an optical system with a rectangular aperture. We then obtain the statistical properties of the image intensity from the statistical properties of the square of the envelope of a narrowband noise signal in the electrical model. The analysis is simple because use can be made of results known in communication theory. The results agree with those obtained in a direct way."
 "On page 3440 of the December 1969 Bell System Technical Journal, Reference 6, “Comparison of An Energy Density Antenna System with Predetection Combining Systems for Mobile Radio” by W. C. Y. Lee, was mistakenly listed as an unpublished work. That article was published in the IEEE Trans on Communication Technology, 17, No. 2 (April 1969), pp. 277–284."
"We propose a delta modulator which, at every sampling instant r, adapts its step-size (for a staircase approximation to the input signal) on the basis of a comparison between the two latest channel symbols, Cr and Cr-1. Specifically, the ratio of the modified step-size mr to the previous step size mr-1 is either +P or — Q depending on whether Cr and Cr-1 are equal or not. (We recall that, in delta modulation, Cr represents the polarity of the difference, at the sampling instant r, between the input signal Xr and the latest staircase approximation to it, Yr-1.) A simulation of the delta modulator with a band-limited speech input has revealed that PQ = 1 and P ⋍ 1.5 represent optimal adaptation characteristics, on the basis of signal-to-error ratios, over an important range of sampling frequencies; and that at 60 kHz, delta modulation with these adaptation parameters compares favorably with 7-bit logarithmic PCM, which reproduces speech with good telephone quality. We present several graphical results from this simulation, and include an evaluation of the effect of independent channel errors on the adaptive delta modulator. We proceed to suggest a heuristic theory of the delta modulator which explains the optimality of the condition PQ = 1, and develops an upper bound of 2 for the optimum value of P. We conclude with a summary of results from a video simulation which revealed that aforementioned optima for P and Q apply to a video signal"
"Many mobility versus field curves for gaseous ions show a high mobility “bump” just above the ohmic range. The effect arises from the nature of the force between ions and molecules. It is effectively attractive for low speeds of encounter and repulsive for high speeds. A partial cancellation of deflections occurs in a range of intermediate speeds; the scattering cross section then appears to be abnormally low."
"Radii and occupation numbers have been calculated for the first 50 shells of neighbors on each atomic sublattice for the CsCl, NaCl, zincblende, wurtzite, and CaF2 binary lattices. We present the results in tabular form along with rules for extending the tables to higher shell numbers. A sublattice approach is used and tables are given for key cubic and hexagonal-based sublattices. The generality of the sublattice approach is such as to allow easy application of the tables to more complex lattice structures or to such problems as enumeration of preferred interstitial sites. A number-theoretic explanation is offered for previously observed difficulties in obtaining a simple expression for the radius of the m-th shell in cubic-based structures."
"The effectiveness of word stuffing for synchronization depends upon our ability to distinguish the stuff words from the data words at the destination and, thus, delete correctly the stuff words. If all input sequences are permitted, the data words must be encoded before stuffing occurs so that the stuff word can be distinct from the data words. In this paper, we give the code that, for a given redundancy, maximizes the minimum distance between the stuff word and any data word. This helps to prevent the loss of character synchronization because of transitions between data and stuff words due to transmission errors. In contrast to the perfect distance symmetries between the code words of the group codes normally encountered in error-control work, the primary virtue of the present code is its highly asymmetric distance structure."
"This paper extends the results of a previous paper in which two models of a system of queues served in cyclic order were studied. One model is an exhaustive service model, in which the server waits on all customers in a queue before proceeding to the next queue in cyclic order. The other is a gating model, in which a gate closes behind the waiting units when the server arrives, and the server waits on only those customers in front of the gate, deferring service of later arrivals until the next cycle. In the present paper, the Laplace-Stieltjes transforms of the order-of-arrival waiting time distribution functions and, for the exhaustive service model, the mean waiting time for a unit arriving at a queue, are obtained."
"To provide a mathematical tool for the evaluation of cable pairs, this paper suggests a quality measure which is based on information theory. While a group of cable pairs (paired wires) with a given gauge and construction are nominally equivalent, manufacturing tolerances and differences in installation and environment lead to variation from the nominal parameters. To measure the quality of a group of channels (for example, cable pairs leaving a central office), this paper recommends the following procedure. Choose a fraction p of the original group and evaluate the mutual information between input and output of each channel in the subgroup, subject to the input to each channel being chosen from the same process. Then, by choosing the proper process, maximize the smallest mutual information in the subgroup. This largest possible minimum mutual information is a quality measure for the subgroup. Next, apply this measure to all subgroups of fractional size p; the subgroup with the highest measure provides the numerical value of the quality measure for the original group relative to fraction p. Repeat this procedure for all p (0 ≦ p ≦ 1). The resulting function is the suggested quality measure of the group. To illustrate the above measure of quality, we derive the capacity of an ensemble of channels with stationary Gaussian inputs, additive noise, and crosstalk. In the Appendix we derive the capacity of a single such channel."
"A method is presented for the computation of the far field radiation patterns of paraboloid reflector antennas by using a modified stationary phase approximation to eliminate one integration. This method is applicable to open cassegrain, offset paraboloid and horn reflector antennas. For symmetrical paraboloid antennas the modified approximation reduces to the exact expression obtained by direct integration. The errors introduced by the stationary phase and modified stationary phase approximations are investigated. Specifically the far field of an open cassegrain with a 128 wavelength aperture diameter is computed by the approximate method up to 20 degrees off-axis. The difference between these radiation patterns and those computed by double integration, is less than a few tenths of a dB up to 1.0 degree, and less than a few hundredths of a dB at larger angles off-axis. In order to estimate the computational advantage of this approximation, the number of points required for integration of an oscillatory function by Simpson's rule is also examined and it is determined that at least 6 points per cycle are necessary to obtain 4 decimal accuracy. For fewer points the error is appreciable."
"A rational transfer function to be realized by an RC-active network is usually decomposed into functions of at most second degree. We present a method for achieving this — which maximizes the dynamic range of the whole network while minimizing inband losses. The method is based on the “bottleneck problem.”"
 "A method for precision thinning silicon integrated circuit slices has been developed whereby either n or p type regions may be selectively removed from material of opposite conductivity. The existence of a simple and economical means to attain precise thickness control permits more complete advantage to be taken of many silicon IC structures. For example, precise thickness control, together with anisotropic1 etching of isolation/separation slots, is expected to permit economical fabrication of high component density, air-isolated monolithic2 integrated circuits."
"This paper concerns approximation in the Chebyshev, or minimax sense such that (i) a minimax approximation implies a maximum number of zero error points separated by equal error extrema, and (ii) the approximating function can be so formulated that the disposable parameters are all the coefficients in a polynomial, which may however be part of a more complicated function the rest of which is prescribed. Weighted minimax polynomial approximations can be included, by multiplying the approximated and approximating functions by the weight factor. Analytic methods are described which yield approximately equal error extrema. They are sufficiently simple so that they may sometimes compete with currently used iterative numerical methods, especially when the degree of the disposable polynomial is large. Their most probable utility concerns explorations of available accuracies over wide ranges of design parameters such as degree of disposable polynomial, interval of approximation, and coefficients in prescribed parts of the approximating function."
"This paper describes an investigation of the feasibility of increasing the information transmission capacity of a guided millimeter wave communication system by using quaternary and higher order modulation techniques in place of binary. It first presents a generalization of the binary system to higher orders and then extends the results of previously derived error-rate predictions. An experimental repeater for quaternary modulation which uses components that are similar to those used for binary modulation is then described along with associated equipment used for signal generation and performance evaluation. Finally, performance data on the repeater are given and compared with theory."
"Crosstalk limits the number of communication channels which are spatially resolvable at the end of a beam waveguide. The main sources of crosstalk are scattering and distortion by the focusers. A careful study of high quality front surface mirrors led to the results of this paper. The best choice seems to be a periscopic guide made of dielectric mirrors when used with gaussian beams in a particular mode of multiple transmission. We give a closed description for the expected power profile of a gaussian beam that has passed such a guide and an approximate formula for the mutual crosstalk between several such beams."
"A system consisting of a spring, dashpot, and mass upon which is mounted an eccentric driven by a motor with a linear torque-speed characteristic, is analyzed by perturbation procedures based on small reciprocal of rotational inertia. Periodic solutions of the third order system, which arises when the angular position of eccentric mass is taken as the new independent variable, are constructed, and their stability is analyzed. An asymptotic solution is also obtained which is more general than a periodic solution, in that the averaged rotational speed is a slowly varying function, rather than a constant. The results are applicable to the determination of the interaction between the rotational motion of a flexibly mounted motor and the translational vibratory motion of its frame."
"The standard method of computing the mutual information between two stochastic processes with finite energy replaces the processes with their Fourier coefficients. This procedure is mathematically justified here for random signals w,(ω) square-integrable in the product space t × ω where t ∊ [O, T] and w is an element of a probability space. A natural notion of the sigma field generated by w, (ω) is presented and it is shown to coincide with the sigma field generated by the random Fourier coefficients of w,(ω) in any complete orthonormal system in L2[O, T]. This justifies the use of Fourier coefficients in mutual information computations. Capacity is calculated for finite and infinite-dimensional channels, where the output signal consists of a filter (general Hilbert-Schmidt operator) operating on the input signal with additive Gaussian noise. The finite-dimensional optimal signal is obtained. In the infinite-dimensional case capacity can be approached arbitrarily closely with finite-dimensional inputs. The question of the existence of an infinite-dimensional signal which achieves capacity is considered. There are channels for which no signal achieves capacity. Some results are obtained when the noise coordinates are independent in the eigensystem of the filter."
"This paper reports on further results concerning nonlinear equations of the form F(x) + Ax = B, in which F(·) is a “diagonal nonlinear mapping” of real Euclidean n-space En into itself, A is a real n × n matrix, and B is an element of En. Such equations play a central role in the dc analysis of transistor networks, the computation of the transient response of transistor networks, and the numerical solution of certain nonlinear partial-differential equations. Here a nonuniqueness result, which focuses attention on a simple special property of transistor-type nonlinearities, is proved; this result shows that under certain conditions the equation F(x) + Ax = B has at least two solutions for some B ∊ En. The result proves that some earlier conditions for the existence of a unique solution cannot be improved by taking into account more information concerning the nonlinearities, and therefore makes more clear that the set of matrices denoted in earlier work by P0 plays a very basic role in the theory of nonlinear transistor networks. In addition, some material concerned with the convergence of algorithms for computing the solution of the equation F(x) + Ax = B is presented, and some theorems are proved which provide more of a theoretical basis for the efficient computation of the transient response of transistor networks. In particular, the following proposition is proved. If the dc equations of a certain general type of transistor network possess at most one solution for all B ∊ En for “the original set of α's as well as for an arbitrary set of not-larger α's”, then the nonlinear equations encountered at each time step in the use of certain implicit numerical integration algorithms possess a unique solution for all values of the step size, and hence then for all step-size values it is possible to carry out the algorithms."
"We give a relation which links emitter and collector junction voltages, Veb and Veb, collector current Ic, and the total charge Qb of carriers that enter through the base terminal (electrons in a pnp transistor): $I_{c} = const{e^(aV_{eb / kT}) - e^(aV_{eb / kT})\\over Q_{b}}.$ This relation is valid for high injection conditions, subject only to minor restrictions. The significance for device modeling is discussed."
"This paper describes the application of the rain attenuation theory of Ryde and Ryde to the design of Radio Systems. It shows that an upper bound on the outage time due to rain attenuation can be computed from a measured point rain rate distribution. The paper also describes a suitable rain gauge."
"The quality of thermal gas lenses can be significantly improved if the heated gas is exhausted radially. This type of exhaust is typically created in a counter-flow lens where opposing gas flows pass through two closely spaced lens sections and exhaust radially through a small gap between these sections. We found that the stability of the focusing behavior depends on a laminar flow transition region of sufficient length, a properly chosen width and shape of the exhaust gap, and on mechanical symmetry and smoothness. We describe the guiding properties of a single lens as well as a beam waveguide consisting of up to eleven counter-flow lenses. Off-axis injections of the light beam with displacements amounting up to 45 percent of the lens radius resulted only in changes of the beam width (less than 23 percent for 11 lenses), whereas the gaussian profile was essentially maintained."
 "Most of the technology we use today in the Bell System has been developed since the invention of the telephone just less than a century ago. Our basic source of stand-by power, however, is still the lead-acid secondary cell, which was invented by Planté in 1859, and which, apart from the introduction by Fauré of pasted electrodes a little later, remains essentially unchanged in design to the present day. The files of the U. S. Patent Office are crammed with disclosures of other secondary cells, and some of these have achieved a limited market; but for most of our business, as for the automotive industry, the lead-acid cell still reigns supreme. The reasons for this are, of course, partly technical and partly economic. The lead-acid cell has an energy density figure that still looks reasonably good when compared with that of its competitors; it can be cycled many times without irreparable damage; the internal resistance is low; and it can be maintained fully charged for long periods by passing through it a small “float” current. At the same time, despite the somewhat limited use of mass production techniques, battery manufacturers have been able to produce cells and sell them to us at a price that compares favorably with the price of other secondary cells."
"A new cylindrical lead-acid battery has been developed to provide reserve power to sustain telephone service during power-failure conditions. We discuss in this paper the usage of batteries in the modern telephone plant, review the difficulties encountered with existing cell designs, describe in detail special features of the new design, and outline the scope of the overall development program."
"In this paper, we present accelerated test data which show the superior anodic corrosion and growth behavior of pure lead as compared to lead calcium and lead-antimony positive grids for lead-acid batteries in float service. We relate differences in growth behavior to differences in metallurgy for these three alloy systems. Pure lead has been incorporated into circular grid designs and tests show these to be a substantial improvement over conventional rectangular grids. A novel grid design concept has been developed and applied to the design of pure lead circular grids. The rate and direction of growth in the grids are controlled by appropriate geometrical design of the grid members. Batteries incorporating these circular grids increase in capacity with age rather than decrease in capacity as do rectangular grids. The circular grids can be designed to provide lifetimes of several centuries."
"We present a reproducible method of synthesizing tetrabasic lead sulfate (4PbO · PbSO4) which produces discrete elongated crystals approximately 22 microns long. Tetrabasic lead sulfate undergoes anodic conversion to PbO2 while maintaining the characteristic morphology of the 4PbO · PbSO4 crystals. This results in lead-acid battery positive plates having performance characteristics superior to those fabricated from conventional paste formulations. We furnish data showing the performance of 4PbO · PbSO4 positive plates as a function of plate porosity and present stress cycling data, comparing it with the behavior of typical conventional positive plates."
"We discuss in this article the requirements for satisfactory float operation of lead-acid batteries and analyze behavior during float in terms of the kinetic parameters which characterize the electrochemical processes occurring in the overcharge region. We show how knowledge of these parameters may be used to estimate whether adequate battery maintenance can be expected under specified float conditions. The results emphasize the need for cell uniformity, and the treatment provides a basis for determining what variability is permissible."
"The electrochemical characteristics of pure lead circular grids, pasted plates and seperators were studied individually and then extrapolated to encompass a full battery. We present polarization data for grids and pasted plates. These can be scaled to predict battery behavior when one takes the role of the separator into consideration. Proper venting of entrapped gases results in capacity behavior of the circular cell which is at least equal to equivalent commercial cells. The overcharge or float behavior was shown in the laboratory to be excellent. Field trials have confirmed the laboratory tests and have shown that the battery has excellent capacity and float characteristics which ensure that this capacity will be retained for long periods of time."
"A detailed materials engineering evaluation of a low-cost, high impact, structurally modified rigid polyvinyl chloride (PVC) has demonstrated that battery jars and covers can be molded from PVC in conventional equipment. The battery jars are flame resistant, transparent, and sufficiently tough to withstand considerable abuse without cracking. Although mechanical properties indicate the material becomes slightly more brittle after exposure to 1.220 specific gravity H2SO4 at 120°F, the behavior at all times exceeds the currently used styrene-acrylonitrile in toughness. PVC maintains its rigidity beyond 120°F and accelerated tests indicate it will creep less than 1 percent after 20 years at room temperature under all expected loads. Jars weighing 12 pounds and covers weighing 4.5 pounds were each molded in carefully designed molds in a five minute cycle at 400°F without difficulty. The molded parts show very little stress concentration even without expensive annealing treatments and are free of molding defects. The cover diameter is molded 0.005 in. larger than the jar to insure proper fit during assembly. This dimensional accuracy is maintained without requiring special cooling fixtures after molding to restrict uneven shrinkage."
"Because of the float use-mode of reserve batteries in the Bell System, the cell behavior is quile sensitive to small amounts of eleclroaclive organic substances in the cell electrolyte. Premature cell failure has in the past resulted from the introduction of a new plastic without testing its compatibility with the cell electrochemistry. We describe an accelerated test method by which the extraction rate of organic residues from the plastic container into the cell electrolyte is predicted and the electrochemical effects of these residues is determined. These data predict that in normal service no adverse electrochemical effects from interaction of the electrolyte with the jar or covcr will occur in the cylindrical lead-acid cell for a minimum of 50 years."
"A novel jar-cover seal has been designed and fabricated for the new Bell System battery. The seal consists of a tongue-and-groove seal joint design (jar and cover respectively) with an infrared heat absorbing layer at the joint interface. This heat absorbing layer causes the fusion and sealing of the jar and cover surfaces when exposed to high intensity concentrated infrared energy. The seals prepared in this manner are leak free, acid resistant and have extremely high joint strength. A jar-cover seal life equivalent to the useful life of the polyvinyl chloride in the jar is anticipated."
"A novel post seal has been designed and fabricated for the new Bell System battery. The seal consists of a cylindrical “clamp” of a rigid cured epoxy resin molded in place on the lead posts and a flexible one-piece butyl rubber structure attached to the epoxy and to the battery jar cover. Accelerated tests show that the seal effectively slows lead corrosion. A useful seal life in excess of 40 years is predicted."
"Two fusion-bonding processes have been devised for bonding adjacent curved- or flat-lead lugs of the positive plates used in the new Bell Laboratories lead-acid battery. We describe both processes, but emphasize the Mechanical Thermal Pulse (MTP) Continuous Fusion-Bonding Process, which was chosen for use in the prototype battery manufacture. This process is capable of bonding many battery lugs simultaneously with simple equipment and with relatively precise control of bonding parameters."
"The new Bell System battery has been designed to eliminate the problems experienced in applying the old cells. This article tells how the new cell will be incorporated into the telephone plant and describes a new plastic battery rack which has been specifically designed to accommodate the new cell in an optimum manner."
"Recent mathematical1,2 and engineering studies3,4 of the possibility of rearranging existing calls in a connecting network (so as to add more calls) have raised the problem of loss (probability of blocking) for networks operated in this manner. We consider and solve this problem in the context of a Markov traffic model, for a connecting network operated according to the rule that if a new call is blocked, but can be accommodated by rearranging the calls in progress, then it is put up, after some choice of rearrangement."
"A closed-form solution for the potential in a current-free semiconductor surrounding a semi-infinite flat plate, carrying a small potential, is derived. We show that, just as in the case of the classical potential problem, there is a weak (square-root) singularity in the electric field at the edge of the plate. The solution also supplies an estimate of the effect of edge curvature, on edge field for a thick plate, found from equipotential contours. For a plate along the positive x-axis the normalized potential u is given by $u = e^{y}{{\\rm erfc}(\\xi + \\eta)\\over 2} + e^{-y} \\left[1 - {{\\rm erfc}(\\xi - \\eta) \\over 2}\\right],$ where erfc is the complementary error function; ξ, η parabolic coordinates, such that (ξ + iη)2 = × + iy; and x and y are in units of Debye length."
"Interference coupling due to rain is an important factor in coordinating the shared use of frequencies between satellite-communications and terrestrial microwave radio-relay systems. Calculations of the coupling between a satellite ground station and a radio-relay station due to scattering by rain are given for the frequencies 4, 6, 11, 18.5 and 30 GHz. Several models of the rain environment are considered, one in which the rain falls uniformly over the path, and others involving localized showers in the earth-station beam. The beam of the earth-station antenna is taken to be elevated 30° above the local horizon. Interstation distances from 5 km to 200 km and rain rates up to 400 mm/hr are considered. The analysis includes the near field of the earth-station antenna and shows that attenuation by the rain on the path plays an important role at the higher frequencies. The greatest coupling occurs when the beam of the earth-station antenna is pointed opposite to the azimuth of the relay station. In that case, when the radio-relay antenna response in the direction of the earth station is isotropic, the maximum couplings are −132 dB and − 164 dB at 4 GHz with separations of 5 km and 200 km respectively, for a rain rate of 400 mm/hr."
"Experimental and theoretical results are presented which show that deep fades due to multipath propagation on line-of-sight microwave links are greatly reduced in number when two vertically separated receiving antennas are used and the stronger of the two received signals is selected as the diversity signal. The experimental results are based on 6 GHz propagation data obtained for a 72-day period on a 28.5 mile path in Ohio, with a 27.5 foot vertical separation of the receiving antennas. The theoretical results are obtained by treating the received signals as correlated Rayleigh distributed random variables. Theoretically predicted variations with fade depth agree with experimental observations. Combination of the theoretical results with experimentally determined parameters provides results which can be used, for example, to calculate the reduction in the number of fades as a function of the vertical separation of the receiving antennas, wavelength, path length, fade depth, and the gain difference (if any) of the receiving antennas."
"Digital information transmitted by means of a pulse amplitude modulation scheme depends critically on the pulse shape for reliable high speed communications. The pulse shape, in turn, depends in great measure on precise phase equalization. A new technique for the design of phase equalizers, based on digital mean square error, has been developed. This criterion is appropriate for a digital transmission system because it can be related to the system error rate. A lower bound to the digital mean square error is first obtained by determining the theoretically optimum phase. A physical equalizer consists of a cascade of many (say N) constant resistance all-pass networks. For each of several different values of N, an optimization search over the parameters of the all-pass networks is then done. The smallest value of N which yields an error satisfactorily close to the lower bound is utilized for the optimum physical phase equalizer. The major benefits derived from using this technique as opposed to the conventional one are: (i) A significant reduction in the number of all pass sections required. (ii) More practical element values, facilitating network manufacture. (iii) A substantial improvement in system performance."
"Segment companding laws are being considered for use in PCM to cater to the possibility of digital processing of uniformly quantized signals. A unified formulation of the segment companding laws is presented, which permits the detailed structure of quantization to be explicitly characterized. Most important, it is shown that this formulation yields algorithms for the systematic synthesis of coders, decoders, and digital compandors. Examples of circuits synthesized from the algorithms are shown for two segment law companding families — the μ-law and the A-law."
 "The far field radiation patterns of open cassegrain antennas have been previously computed by a double integration1. Recently one integration has been eliminated by using a modified stationary phase approximation2. The rather remarkable accuracy thus obtained motivated an investigation to estimate the error in this approximation."
"Recently P. K. Tien and his co-workers have described a prism coupler as a convenient means to feed light into a single mode of a guiding thin optical film.1 Distributed couplers of this kind are of great interest for integrated optical devices. In this brief we describe thin"
"The fabrication of semiconductor and thin-film integrated circuits requires the delineation of precisely defined patterns in various materials in order to obtain the required functional performance of the device. Photolithographic processing has primarily been used for this purpose, requiring that masks be generated as the basic “tool” for producing integrated circuits. This issue is devoted to a detailed description of a new mask-making system intended to satisfy the Bell System's requirements for increasing numbers of increasingly complex masks. The system features high precision and large throughput made possible by a specially designed family of machines linked together by a computer-controlled information system."
"This paper reviews how photolithographic masks for silicon and thin-film integrated circuits are made. Increasing production and complexity of masks makes heavy demands on the operating time, reproducibility, and accuracy of the new mask-making system. The pattern generation step, in which the design is converted to a photographic image, is critical to the system. Advantages and disadvantages of other pattern-producing methods are discussed. The technique of producing patterns by optically scanning lines with a rotating mirror while mechanically stepping the photographic plate is described. This article develops the basic design parameters of address structure and operational speed for the primary pattern generator, and it defines the requirements for reduction cameras and the step-and-repeat camera for a system capable of meeting the needs for both thin-film and silicon integrated circuits. The article notes the system limitations imposed by optical generation of patterns and lens tolerances."
"Computer systems play a fundamental role in the operation of precision integrated-circuit pattern generators. This paper first describes the XYMASK system which provides a language for describing the geometric shapes in a set of masks and generates graphical artwork on a number of different pattern generators. The remainder of the paper is devoted to discussions of system-design considerations and algorithms for generating input to the primary pattern generator and the electron beam machine."
"The need for a new, high-speed pattern generator capable of producing the more complex and precise circuit patterns required in the 1970s has already been discussed.1 This paper describes the design and operation of the Primary Pattern Generator (PPG) in some detail. For the convenience of the reader, the paper has been separated into four parts. Part I covers the optical design of the machine, including the considerations which led to the choice of an argon laser light source, a recording emulsion, and an optimum combination of spot size and brightness. The original choice of a mechanically scanned system was made on the premise that, with such an approach, the required accuracy could be built in and retained over many years of operation, and Part II discusses the principal considerations behind this premise. In that paper are discussed the dimensional stability of the structural materials and their use in an extremely stiff structure, the features provided to align the parts of the system to the required tolerances, and the design of drive systems, essentially free from both vibration and wear. The control of the machine to produce the pattern encoded on the input tape is discussed in Part III; Part IV deals with the methods used to align the assembled machine and details the pattern accuracy and reproducibility which was achieved."
"I. INTRODUCTION The basic design concept of the primary pattern generator (PPG) is the production of a linearly scanning, small, constant-size light spot. The scanning system consists of a regular polygonal-prism mirror which rotates about its axis of highest symmetry. The mirror faces are used sequentially to reflect a collimated light beam into a lens (for example, the scanning lens of Fig. 1). The collimated light is focused to a spot which scans a line in the focal plane of the lens as the polygonal mirror rotates. Located in the focal plane of the lens is a flat, glass photographic plate. The glass plate is moved by the desired scan line separation during the time required to bring the succeeding mirror facet into proper position."
"I. INTRODUCTION The primary pattern generator (PPG) is an electromechanical light-scanning system with an unusual combination of speed and accuracy. A 10-μm-diameter light spot can be addressed successively to any or all points of a 26,000-wide by 32,000-long rectangular point array with 7-μm vertical and horizontal spacing in about ten minutes. This corresponds to a scanning rate of one spot per 600 nanoseconds. The light spot is placed repeatedly to an accuracy of about a ±7-μm total accumulated error over the whole array, and the vertical and horizontal spacing between points is maintained within ±1 μm."
"I. INTRODUCTION The primary pattern generator (PPG) writing-control system has two main functions: (i) interpret the commands generated by the XYMASK PPG postprocessor, and generate from these commands a bit-by-bit image of a scan line and stepping-table control; and (ii) check the operation of the PPG system."
"I. REQUIREMENT FOR ALIGNMENT The mechanical nature of the primary pattern generator (PPG) requires a precise juxtaposition of most of the machine elements in order to achieve both pattern accuracy and reliable functioning of the machine. Part II described the alignment of the rotating polygonal mirror to the air-bearing axis. The precision required in that assembly is the tightest tolerance in the PPG. This precision is required to produce a uniform scan-line spacing on the pattern. In addition, the direction of that scan line must be made as perpendicular as possible to the travel direction of the photographic plate. Therefore, the carriage of the photographic plate must move without rotation. The method for aligning the polygonal mirror axis to the carriage direction will be described, as well as other alignment needed to produce an accurate pattern. The code-plate system for controlling the fast scan was described in Parts I and III. Implicit in this description was the assumption that the code-plate grating and the photographic plate are the exact same distance from the scanning lens (see Fig. 1 in Ref 1). The positioning of the code plate to achieve accurate length of the fast scan is a critical alignment that requires a combination of optical and electronic techniques."
"An electron beam pattern generator is being developed to write directly on photographic plates with a 4-μm diameter beam over a 5-cm by 5-cm field with an address structure of 25,000 by 25,000. Two unique features of this pattern generator are random-access computer control of the beam and a 15-bit digital-to-analog converter stable to better than ±1 part in 106. Capability for drawing 4-μm lines having an edge gradient less than 0.5 μm and an optical density greater than three has been demonstrated. Stability of better than ±1 μm in 24 hours over a 4-mm by 4-mm field has been achieved. Experiments still in progress have demonstrated ±1-μm stability over the entire 5-cm by 5-cm field for shorter time periods. Reticles of typical complexity are drawn routinely in less than five minutes."
"Certain additives increase the electron sensitivity of Kodak's negative photoresists by a factor of five to seven; others increase the sensitivity of AZ-1350 by a factor of two to three. With additives the contrast of the negative resists is increased, leading to sharper edges and higher resolution. Some of these additives also increase the light sensitivity of both positive and negative resists. A recording system based on a silver halide emulsion and containing a conductive underlay is also described."
"The edge definition, maximum complexity and accuracy of details in photolithographic masks are limited by the performance of the lenses in the system. The tolerances on exposure, sensitivity and uniformity of the photosensitive materials, and processing are dependent upon the images formed exceeding the minimum quality required. The lenses in this system have been designed and fabricated to achieve the best practical performance at this time in order to obtain the largest tolerances possible. This paper details the design parameters chosen, the constructions used and the performance obtained by each of the lenses in the system."
"This paper describes the optical design of the photolithographic reduction cameras and discusses in detail several aspects of the illumination system including the light source spectrum, the method of attaining even illumination, and the use of a Fresnel condenser lens. The camera design provides for first-order correction of focus and magnification shifts due to changes in ambient temperature. To adjust the cameras for best focus and proper magnification, a new technique using a special test reticle and digital computers was developed. It automates much of the procedure and processes much more data than would otherwise be possible. The reticle allows simultaneous measurement of focus and magnification errors throughout the image field, and a time-shared computer calculates the required corrective shifts on the object- and image-spacer bars."
"I. INTRODUCTION The 3.5X and 1.4X reduction cameras basically employ the same structural features differing only in the lenses and focal distances required to achieve the desired reductions. Both cameras have been designed as fixed-focus cameras in that no adjustment is made on individual components to optimize the focus and magnification."
"We discuss in this paper the design of a new high-precision step-and-repeat camera with respect to its optics, mechanical design, control system, and control computer program. One micrometer images from a 5-mm-square lens field can be placed within 0.12 μm over a 10-cm × 10-cm area on photographic glass plate. Features such as, image plane control, inter-ferometric metering, and automatic reticle pattern alignment, are used to accomplish these objectives. The control computer with CRT message displays for the operator result in an efficient operator-machine interaction."
"New camera systems, utilizing lenses of high numerical aperture and concomitant shallow depth of focus, require thin recording media. A number of materials potentially fulfilling this requirement are discussed. These include photoresist-coated metal or semitransparent masks, some unconventional photographic processes, and dyed photographic emulsions. The use of dyed photographic emulsions is recommended on the basis of sensitivity and improved resolution and modulation of the recorded image."
"In development and operation of the mask-making laboratory, a precise positional measurement system is needed. This paper describes a system based on a Do-all coordinate measurement machine, controlled by a PDP-8 computer. The computer handles all sequential operations as well as computation necessary for coordinate transformation and feature location. The result is a system which can measure an array of 208 points to an accuracy of ±1 μm in less than two hours. Without computer control, measurement of such an array is not feasible."
"The Mask Shop Information System (MSIS) is a set of computer tasks which exist in a specially designed multi-programming environment within a PDP-9 computer, and which control the flow of jobs through the new mask-making facility. The main functions of MSIS are to accept job descriptions and to assign tasks and pass data to the various shop facilities so that these jobs can be efficiently processed. In addition, MSIS keeps statistics on the progress and problems of the shop and issues reports both periodically and upon demand."
"This paper is concerned with the statistical properties of the output y(t) of a periodically varying linear system when the input is random shot noise. Usually y(t) can be divided into a noise part, yN(t), and a periodic part, yper(t). Expressions are obtained for the Fourier components of yper(t) and the power spectrum of yN(t). Various averages associated with y(t) are studied. Some of the results for shot noise input can be converted into corresponding results for white noise input. Some of the theoretical results are illustrated by applying them to two examples. In both examples the system consists of an arrangement of a resistance, a condenser, and a switch which opens and closes periodically. The output is the voltage across the condenser."
"The determination of the error probability of a data transmission system in the presence of intersymbol interference and additive gaussian noise is a major goal in the analysis of such systems. The exhaustive method for finding the error probability calculates all the possible states of the received signal using an N-sample approximation of the true channel impulse response. This method is too time-consuming because the computation involved grows exponentially with N. The worst-case sequence bound avoids the lengthy computation problem but is generally too loose. In this paper, we have developed a new method∗ which yields the error probability in terms of the first 2k moments of the intersymbol interference. A recurrence relation for the moments is derived. Therefore, a good approximation to the error probability of the true channel can be obtained by choosing N large enough, and the amount of computation involved increases only linearly with N. The series expansion is shown to be absolutely convergent, and an upper bound on the series truncation error is given. In order to show the improvement provided in this new method, it is compared with the Chernoff bound technique in three representative cases. An order of magnitude improvement in accuracy is obtained."
"We derive the limiting efficiencies of dc-constrained codes. Given bounds on the running digital sum (RDS), the best possible coding efficiency η, for a K-ary transmission alphabet, is η = log2 λmax/log2 K, where λmax is the largest eigenvalue of a matrix which represents the transitions of the allowable states of RDS. Numerical results are presented for the three special cases of binary, ternary and quaternary alphabets."
"We develop a method for calculating the pull-in range of a phase-locked loop with a binary phase comparator and an arbitrary loop filter. Complete numerical results are presented for loop filters of the phase-lag and low-pass types. The problem of stability is also considered, and it is proved that with these loop filters no steady-state phase jitter can exist after frequency acquistion has been achieved."
"In this article we propose a fast, efficient technique for generating a pseudorandom stream of uniformly-distributed numbers. The arithmetic operations required are an L bit exclusive-or, a rotation, and a shift to update the state of the number generator. With moderately large values of L we have been able to generate sequences of numbers whose periods are quite long (on the order of 2 × 107 long). Its simplicity of construction, as well as its ability to generate long streams of independent pseudorandom uniformly-distributed integers make this noise generator a worthy candidate for use in high-speed digital systems."
"The modes of propagation in optical systems which do not possess meridional planes of symmetry (nonorthogonal systems) are investigated in the case where the effect of apertures and losses can be neglected. The fundamental mode of propagation is obtained with the help of a complex ray pencil concept. An integral transformation of the field, based on a quasi-geometrical optics approximation and a first-order expansion of the point characteristic of the optical system, is given; it shows that the complex (three-dimensional) wavefront of the fundamental mode is transformed according to a generalized “ABCD law.” A simple expression is also obtained for the phase-shift experienced by the beam. The higher order modes of propagation are obtained from a power series expansion of the fundamental mode. These higher order modes are expressed, in oblique coordinates, as the product of the fundamental solution and finite series of Hermite polynomials with real arguments. In the special case of systems with rotational symmetry, these series reduce to the well-known generalized Laguerre polynomials. The theory is applicable to media such as helical gas lenses and optical waveguides suffering from slowly varying deformations in three dimensions. Nonorthogonal resonant systems are also investigated. An expression for the resonant frequencies, applicable to any three-dimensional resonator, is derived. Numerical results are given for the resonant frequencies and the resonant field of a twisted path cavity which exhibits interesting properties: the usual polarization degeneracy is lifted and the intensity pattern of all of the modes possesses a rotational symmetry."
"In this paper we investigate circular optical resonators with gaussian profiles of the mirror reflectivities. Closed form solution to the integral equations for such resonators are obtained. The dominant TEMo,o mode characteristics of a resonator consisting of one variable reflectivity mirror (VRM) and one uniform reflectivity mirror (URM) are considered in detail for a variety of parameters. This resonator is particularly suitable for high-gain lasers. Its advantages in comparison to the conventional type are: (i) there is larger mode volume utilization, and (ii) the power transmitted at the variable reflectivity mirror can in principle be utilized as the power output. We discuss dependence of the spot sizes on laser gain and mirror-curvature tolerances and present a specific design of a Fabry-Perot resonator for fundamental mode operation and the expected performance."
"We consider the design of time-invariant recursive filters of constrained order for one-step prediction of discrete-time stationary processes. For this purpose, we introduce the projecting-filter concept. An nth-order projecting filter for a given process has the characterizing property that with the process as input, the output at each instant is the optimal linear combination of the n previous output and n latest input samples. This definition implies that (i) the filter is stable, (ii) any n + 1 consecutive samples of the prediction error sequence are mutually uncorrelated, (iii) the mean-square prediction error is at least as low as that of the best nth order nonrecursive predictor, and (iv) if the spectral density of the process is rational of order 2n or less, then the nth-order projecting filter coincides with the optimal (unconstrained) linear predictor. A design algorithm for nth-order projecting filters iteratively generates successive sets of coefficients of a time-varying nth-order recursive filter which asymptotically approaches the desired time-invariant filter. The only input data needed for the algorithm are the autocovariance coefficients of the process to be predicted. When the order of the filter is matched to the order of the process, the time-varying filter is the same as the Kalman predictor. The algorithm has yielded effective projecting filters for several specific processes. Our results indicate that near optimal prediction may often be obtained with filters of order lower than that of the optimal unconstrained predictor."
 "Prior to the mid-1950s, transatlantic voice communication was entirely by high frequency radio. Because the transmission quality and reliability did not come up to standards for domestic circuits, the use of the service was limited. Completion of the first transatlantic telephone cable system1 in 1956 brought consistently high-quality overseas transmission to the public for the first time. The telephone user responded to this improvement with a great increase in transoceanic calls."
"This article describes the considerations which led to choice of the SF System design objectives and gives an overview of the system. It further discusses various system parameters and the techniques of laying and adjusting the system for optimum signal-to-noise performance. Finally, the article shows performance results of the recently completed TAT-5 System which extends from Rhode Island to Spain. These results show good agreement with calculated system performance."
"Long-distance submarine cable transmission systems require precise, highly reliable repeaters for amplification, and adjustable equalizers for reducing accumulated transmission deviations. This article describes the problems and solutions in designing suitable repeaters and equalizers for the high capacity SF System. This system uses a repeater with transistors to provide a capacity of 800-message circuits."
"In this article we describe the facilities and procedures used to manufacture SF repeaters and equalizers. Careful selection and training of production and inspection personnel play a vital role in achieving the desired standards in qualifying material and for assembly and test of units. Detailed engineering planning provides the best environmental conditions and manufacturing facilities and processes. Close collaboration by the manufacturer with Bell Telephone Laboratories during product design and specification and during manufacture assures a tightly controlled, well understood product."
"In this paper we describe the active and passive components used in the underwater portion of the SF Cable System. We present reasons for choosing certain types and, where appropriate, outline methods of manufacture, screening, aging and selection. Measures taken to safeguard the components before, during, and after assembly in repeaters are discussed briefly."
"An SF armorless coaxial cable design having lower loss than its predecessor, the SD design, has been developed. Its basic construction is similar to that of the SD Cable. However, its larger diameter, along with lower loss polyethylene and higher conductivity inner conductor copper, provides a substantial decrease in attenuation. A new coupling design has also been developed. The armorless version of the coupling design provides an improvement in return loss between cable and repeater and smaller deflection of the plastic parts under load. The armored version of the coupling provides improved isolation of the steel and beryllium copper parts."
"A special shore terminal transmission facility has been developed for the SF Cable System. The multiplex portion differs from similar domestic plant in that the frequency allocation follows international standard, and can operate with 8-kHz as well as conventional 4-kHz spaced message channels. High reliability is achieved through duplication of equipment combined with added failure detection circuitry and protection switching. Additional features include broadband flexible equalization capability to optimize transmission performance, a separate 4-channel order wire, and automatic pilot measuring equipment. From the point of view of physical design, two departures from conventional practice are the use of shorter than normal bay frameworks and enclosures to cover them. both of which are compatible with foreign design practice. Newly designed test equipment enables monitoring undersea performance and fault locating from the shore terminal. Inclusion of a supervisory oscillator in each repeater is a major change from previous submarine cable systems."
"This article describes the constant current, high voltage power facilities which power the SF Submarine Cable repeaters. The overall power system description includes discussions of the power connections to the cable, and a review of overall design requirements and objectives. The circuit description is covered in a general manner to demonstrate the basic concept. Particular emphasis is given to the description of several significant circuit innovations which include automatic load sharing by two constant current sources, 20 kHz inverter operation with output wave symmetry correction, solid-state alarm detectors, automatic turn-up and turn-down features, electrical noise suppression, redundant shutdown circuits and selective alarm cutoffs. The physical design includes the extensive use of plug-in modules for ease of maintenance, convection cooling of the entire power supply including the test load, and a key interlock system which prevents access to high voltage components when the power supply is energized. A special high-voltage switch can transfer the cable from one power plant to another without interruption of service."
"The objective of route engineering in submarine cable work is to select a path for the proposed cable which is both economical and highly reliable from the standpoint of system integrity. The engineering effort begins with selection of the terminal sites and is carried through to a complete route layout. Echo sounding is the principal technique used for deep water route investigations. In shallow water where extraordinary protection measures such as plowing-in of cable may be required, special survey techniques are used to evaluate a route. These latter techniques include side-scan sonar, subbottom profiling, and the application of a Bell Telephone Laboratories developed survey sled."
"The SF Submarine Cable System relies on equalization of accumulated misalignment at regular intervals along the length of the system to achieve performance objectives. Transmission tests of the undersea system during installation are required to implement this equalization. This article describes the tests that are conducted and the computations used to select equalizer settings just before an equalizer is overboarded."
"We calculate in this paper the output power obtainable, versus frequency, for TRAPATT diodes. This high efficiency mode of operation is analyzed by means of a simplified model for both germanium and silicon avalanche diodes. The model evolved from a study of detailed computer simulations of experimental diode-circuit systems. The simplified analysis assumes: (i) The avalanche zone transit, plus the recovery time to the swept-out state, occurs in a half period of the TRAPATT frequency. (ii) The ratio of IMPATT frequency to TRAPATT frequency is 3:1. (iii) The diode area is chosen to provide 10 ohms negative resistance, a reasonable value for microwave circuits. The calculated electrical characteristics agree well with experimental observations. Consideration of circuit and thermal limitations results in a design for maximum power output for a millimeter wave silicon oscillator. Power output in excess of 1 watt CW, with an efficiency of 40 percent, is predicted at a frequency of 50 GHz."
"We present in this paper a compact model of bipolar transistors, suitable for network analysis computer programs. Through the use of a new charge control relation linking junction voltages, collector current, and base charge, the model includes high injection effects. The performance substantially exceeds that of existing models of comparable complexity. For low bias and with some additional idealization, the model reduces to the conventional Ebers-Moll model."
"We solve numerically the problem of finding the potential and electric field around a negatively charged metallic contact on the surface of an n-type semiconductor. The semiconductor, which has permittivity ∊1, fills the half-space y < 0. The contact is an infinitely long strip of width 2a, defined by y = 0,0 ≦ × ≦ 2a, − ∞ < z < ∞. The region y > 0 is vacuum with permittivity ∊0. In suitable dimensionless coordinates the potential ϕ satisfies Laplace's equation in y > 0 and the equation ▽2ϕ = eϕ − 1 in y < 0. On the boundary y = 0, ϕ = ϕ0 < 0, 0 ≦ × ≦ 2a, and the usual electromagnetic boundary conditions at the remainder of the interface. Finite difference schemes are used to solve the resulting boundary value problem. In most practical cases |ϕ0| » 1 and η = ∊0/∊1> « 1. We examine in considerable detail the limiting case η = 0, first for the less practical situation where |ϕ0| « 1 and then for |ϕ0| » 1. In case the |ϕ0| « 1 we show that our numerical solution agrees well with the exact analytical solution of a linearized version of the problem. For |ϕ0| » 1, we give plots of the equipotential curves, curves of equal charge density, and curves of constant electric field amplitude. These results also yield expressions for the capacitance of both a strip and a circular electrode. The modifications of these results when η > 0 are also given in some detail. Finally, we discuss the numerical calculations at some length."
"It has been experimentally verified that holograms can be transmitted via television using the synthesized carrier-frequency method. A vidicon camera system was used to transmit three on-axis holograms to the receiver where the video signal was used to amplitude modulate a 15 MHz carrier. This modulated carrier was applied to the control grid of a cathode-ray tube, and the synthesized carrier-frequency hologram was then photographed from the tube screen. Several of the experimental problem areas, such as mechanical stability, camera tube storage effects, and display-recording process optimization, are considered in detail."
"This paper is concerned with burst error, burst erasure and combined burst-error and burst-erasure correction. Part I introduces the concept of burst distance and subsequently develops burst-correcting properties of a code relative to its burst distance. Part II discusses product codes for multiple-burst correction (MBC). The MBC properties of a product of two codes are derived from the properties of the original codes. The correction of spot errors is generalized to multiple-spot correction. Theorems are presented which strengthen the single-burst correcting (SBC) properties of some codes. A class of codes which corrects single, triple and quadruple bursts and 5 single errors is developed, and a decoding procedure is given. Finally, a code from the new class of MBC codes is compared with three other MBC codes."

"This article is an introduction to a series of detailed technical articles that describe the Traffic Service Position System No. 1. The organization and objectives of the system are given and the overall operation of the system is explained."
"The Stored Program Control No. 1A processor complex was conceived as a program sequenced control for the Traffic Service Position System No. 1 and for the Electronic Translator Systems. It was designed to be a highly reliable complex using a conservative discrete component hardware design with excellent fault detecting capability and with exceptionally good automatic recovery of call processing when faced with hardware faults. The design aims, order structure, hardware features, fault detection, diagnostic, and recovery aspects of the system are described. Stress is placed on those features which are felt to be improvements over previous program controlled systems."
"The single memory system provided in the Stored Program Control (SPC) No. 1A is built around the piggyback twistor (PBT). Each SPC 1A store provides 770,048 bits of random-access nondestructive readout (NDRO), electronically alterable information organized into 16,384 words. The store has a read-cycle time of 6.3 μs. The paper describes in detail the memory medium, memory circuits, and equipment design. A general description is given of store operations and store diagnostic and maintenance procedures."
"The TSPS No. 1 peripheral circuits permit the data processing ability of the Stored Program Control No. 1A to be applied to TSPS functions. These circuits include scanners, signal distributors, networks, trunk and service circuits, operator positions and the position subsystem. A description of each circuit is given, followed by a description of the features provided by the associated maintenance program."
"The Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) No. 1 Operational Programs provide the call processing logic which controls the handling of calls served by the system. The organization of these programs is described and the major events encountered in processing a sample call are covered in this article."
"Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) No. 1 is designed to make toll customer service and operator call handling more efficient. This equipment is designed to give improved and dependable service. Connectorization is added to permit more efficient shop testing, installation simplification and a ready means to effect quick growth in a working environment. The switchroom equipment and operator facilities are specially designed for pleasing proportion and harmonious color schemes."
"The results of system testing against a set of performance criteria indicate the readiness of a new installation for service. In the first installation of TSPS No. 1 at Morristown, N. J., system testing also had to accomplish a design shakedown concurrent with final design and program debugging efforts at the Holmdel laboratory test model. This article describes the overall efforts and test facilities involved in the initial shakedown."
 "This article describes the system organization and objectives of the No. 1 Electronic Switching System Arranged with Data Features. The new hardware and software designs required to adapt a No. 1 ESS to a store and forward system are outlined with emphasis on the techniques used to get large system capacity, continuous reliable operation, and flexible service features. System operation, traffic capacity, and use of the new system are also discussed in this introduction to seven detailed articles."
"The No. 1 Electronic Switching System, Arranged with Data Features (No. 1 ESS ADF), uses the basic program organization of No. 1 ESS with additional task programs, input-output equipment, and mass storage to provide a reliable switching arrangement for store-and-forward data service. This paper describes the operational program organization used to control the reception of a message into the system from an originating data station, its placement in the message store, and its delivery to the terminating stations. In addition, it describes the service features and the unique characteristics of the system's translation and message-integrity features."
"The No. 1 ESS ADF message switching system provides a store and forward data service which places special demands on system dependability and maintainability. This paper discusses the hardware and software features used to detect and sectionalize troubles, as well as the recovery techniques used to restore service quickly. Maintenance of the line facilities, use of circuit redundancy, and message data protection are also included."
"This paper describes the operation and design features of the data-scanner distributor for the No. 1 ESS ADF. The objective was to design a unit which could handle handshaking, addressing, and message transmission for a large number of duplex data lines at a low cost and with the ability to accommodate all speeds and codes now commonly used in low-speed data machines. The storage medium chosen employs ultrasonic delay lines in a highly time-shared mode. This permitted a compact design which provides input/output capabilities to serve 512 fully duplex data lines. By using a high-speed scan, each character bit of each line is sampled many times. Thus, highly distorted input data can be successfully processed, and output data is essentially distortion free."
"A high thruput, 60 megabit, fixed head per track disk memory system was designed to meet the bulk message store requirements for the No. 1 ESS ADF System. The application in this store and forward message switcher demanded that the disk store meet the stringent reliability requirements consistent with those of an electronic switching system. The article describes the system design features, a temperature-compensated read/write scheme, a synchronizing motor servo system, and automatic maintenance techniques."
"The No. 1 ESS ADF magnetic tape subsystem provides a high-volume, low-cost storage medium in which user messages are filed, and from which current message copies can be automatically retrieved upon user request. Message handling and statistical information concerning all message switching transactions are also filed on tape, providing a journal record for the switching center. Emphasis on maintenance and defensive programming techniques enables the tape subsystem to provide continuous and excellent service. This article describes the tape equipment and program package."
"A solid-state electronic station controller, small enough to be housed within Model 33, 35 and 37 teletypewriters, administers station on-line procedures. To realize automatic message reception and transmission at the station, the controller samples all traffic exchanged between the line and the station teletypewriter, detects message-and device-control characters and generates and detects station-identity codes. In addition, the controller monitors the status of the station teletypewriter and provides appropriate alarms which are displayed on an attendant unit. Stations are linked to the No. 1 ESS ADF office via the Bell System's private line telegraph network. New ac and dc data sets have been developed to accommodate speeds up to 300 bauds with lower distortion and crosstalk generation than previously attainable with former transmission apparatus."
"This article describes the equipment and test procedures used for system testing of a large store and forward system.

"Power conditioning systems for each of the four INTELSAT series are reviewed. INTELSAT I through INTELSAT III satellites are currently in operation at synchronous orbit. The INTELSAT IV series is to be launched starting in 1971. Silicon solar cells are the prime source of power for all these satellites; Ni-Cd batteries are used to supply power during eclipse operation. Progressing from INTELSAT I through IV, different methods were used for battery charging, charge control, voltage regulation, and power management. The technical advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods are presented. Suggestions for future satellites include third electrode charge control with a current regulator for battery charging and a boost regulator for battery discharge."
"A digitally regulated solar-array represents a new concept in high-voltage power supply regulation, A mathematical model of the key elements of such a regulator is presented. It can be used in the performance evaluation of the interface between such a power source and a typical load. A range of load conditions and source states can be simulated. The model permits easy incorporation of source performance changes e.g. changes to solar-cell volt-ampere characterisitics due to temperature or due to radiation degradation."
"A diverse set of specifications and requirements must be met by the power conditioning unit for an electric propulsion system. To meet these requirements, a typical unit contains power conversion, internal control loops, command subsystem for ground control, and telemetry. Power conversion circuitry must supply appropriate power to approximately 10 separate loads; there will be several feedback loops which monitor system operation and control the power conversion circuitry as required. The command subsystem for a typical first generation flight system provides for 12 ground command channels, while the telemetry subsystem provides monitoring and signal conditioning for 12 telemetry channels. To provide the required functions approximately 1200 discrete components would be required. Since a large fraction are devoted to logic and low level analog signal processing, the application of integrated circuits can be highly advantageous, and in fact, a trend toward their use can be identified. Early electric propulsion systems used discrete components exclusively, while the next generation (ca 1967) made extensive use of integrated circuit operational amplifiers and transistor logic building blocks. Requirements for special purpose integrated circuits for use in future systems will be discussed."
"This paper examines the effort of solid state switching upon aerospace electric power conditioning equipment. During the past ten years, aerospace solid state switching concepts have undergone laboratory and flight test evaluations to establish the feasibility of the systems approach. This extension of the program to include power conditioning studies reveals several parameters affecting the design of power conditioning equipment and decsribes several new systems capabilities."
"Projections of future spacecraft operational characteristics indicate that power conditioning requirements will become extremely demanding with respect to output power level, regulation, control, sequencing, and reliability. New approaches for design of power conditioning equipment capable of meeting such requirements are currently under development at a number of government and contractor laboratories. This paper examines areas where improvements in integrated circuit state-of-the-art are desired to overcome special design problems associated with the development of such equipment. Special emphasis is placed on the design problems associated with series inverter circuit currently being mechanized for providing regulated power and controls for an ion thruster. Such a circuit is relatively complex and is used to indicate typical integrated circuit requirements to be encountered in future Aerospace applications."
"Power IC products are still relatively new. The old idea that an IC is limited to only low power applications is giving way as an attack on power functions is being made by the IC industry. The techniques used in the products which are available today are presented and the three basic power IC approaches; the monolithic, chip, the \"monobrid\" circuit (a few chips), and the IC driver with external power transistors, are described."
"There are no technical limits to the successful realization of high power integrated circuits. The move to high power requires that some additional factors be considered. Better packages are required, larger bonding wires are needed, heavier interconnect metal must be used, and large area power transistors are necessary. In addition, the second breakdown or Safe Operating Area limits of the IC power transistors must be watched, the possibilities of high voltage parasitic MOS action requires new layout rules, and finally, the changes in power dissipation on the IC chip during circuit operation should not degrade the overall circuit performance. These problems are not without solutions."
"Up until recently integrated circuits have been synonomous with low voltage applications. The reasons for this are numerous but suffice it to say that the conventional planar IC technology is not conducive to high voltage performance in the individual circuit elements. This paper will describe two modifications of the technology which make high voltage I C s a reality. The restrictions on power dissipation still remain since the power handling capability of an IC as such is primarily determined by chip size and packaging. However, there are many applications for high voltage and low power, and by way of introducing the problems and solutions of such an application, the following simple but useful circuit will be used as a vehicle for discussion."
"A considerable saving in satellite weight is available if loads such as ion thrusters can be operated directly from high voltage solar cell supplies. Such operation raises the need for a high voltage switch for changing loads and reconfiguring the array at different stages of the mission, Silicon p-n junctions can theoretically be made with very high breakdown voltages but processing technology limits switching devices to a few thousand volts. It is shown that increasing the blocking voltage leads to a corresponding increase in the on state conduction loss for a given current density and that the most efficient use of silicon is made by blocking the voltage over several reverse-biased junctions in series. For off-on d.c switching capability series transistor configurations are superior to series thyristor configurations. Control electrodes of the series transistors will be at widely separated potentials when the switch ie off leading to the selection of optoelectronic triggering methods. A conceptual switch design based on the study uses thyristors in the transistor bias supply to minimize the number of power supplies required."
"The power conditioning system described is designed for operation from a 40 to 80 volt solar panel to supply power to a 20 cmo xide cathodeion thruster . The system was tested for more than 1300 hours and sustained thousands of arcs which produce large electromagnetic disturbances . Integ rated circuit swere used throughout for control and telemetry functions. Of special interest is a digit almulti phase modulator used in conjunction with eight inverters to produce 2 kv regulated to within 1 percent at load currents up to 1 ampere . Special care was used to filter noise transients on bus and input lines where integrated circuits were used . Design goal reliability was made possible through the use of integrated circuit s for the complex power conditioning control system ."
"In an experimental satellite, power requirements can keep changing up to the launch date. Power converters with multiple outputs usually have only one output regulated; consequently varying loads will result in varying voltages. If the capability of one output is exceeded, the whole converter may have to be redesigned. One way to maintain flexibility as well as regulation is to use a separately adjustable converter for each required system voltage."
"The rapid development of manned and unmanned space vehicles has created a need for larger and more efficent spacecraft power systems.. Accordingly, the problems of battery charging in space have become more difficult to solve as the systems themselves become more and more complex. The initial and relatively simple schemes for diode coupling solar panels and batteries, for example, have given away to sophisticated electronic devices and systems capable of providing a multiplicity of automatic and commandable battery charging modes, adapted to the requirements of a multiple battery spacecraft."
"This paper describes a novel high efficiency buckboost voltage for use in a solar-array battery space power system. The design approach for the switching regulator is presented, together with an analysis of its operation, definition of its characteristics, and functional performance."
"Most scientific satellites to date have utilized solar cells as the main power source for the spacecraft payload. Two basic methods have been utilized for operating a solar cell array at or near the maximum power point of its I-V characteristics. These two methods may be categorized as either an open loop system or a closed loop system. An open loop system makes use of design parameters of the solar array whereas a closed loop system constantly monitors some system parameter in order to determine maximum power point operation."
"The unit described here is designed for the Airlock Vehicle that will permit coupling between an Apollo spacecraft and a Saturn IVB stage to form a manned orbiting workshop. Solar cell array power, converted by a switching regulator, is used to charge a battery and supply spacecraft loads. Maximum power is extracted from the array if the combined battery and load power requirements exceed the available array power. In addition, the charger provides trickle charge, charge cutoff, and battery voltage and temperature limit functions while supplying spacecraft load power. The special feature of this unit is that the peak array power can vary from 7 0 watts to 2580 watts. Operating array open circuit voltage can be as high as 125 volts. Another feature is that failure of any component will, at most, result only in a slight performance degradation."
"A high power rotary transformer (1 k W ) was considered as a replacement for slip-rings in a future satellite. A study was done to determine the best electrical design taking into account mechanical limitations while maximizing efficiency. Ferrite was used in a configuration which can be ground by any good machine shop. A design procedure is described which provides the engineer with a rough estimate of size and weight of a near optimum transformer given the power level, frequency of operation, and material to be used. The electrical circuit used should be considered during the transformer design. In the widely used voltage controlled push-pull square wave converter there is the problem of transistor storage and fall time. Usually one transistor is turned on before the other is off. The latter transistor then traverses through a high power dissipation region, the peak power being twice the input voltage times input current. Transistors picked for low saturation voltage are usually slower devices aggravating the turn-off dissipation problem. An operating procedure which minimizes these turn-off losses and prevents excursion through high instantaneous dissipation regions has been devised. It allowed the construction of a 1000 watt converter (dc-dc rotary transformer) which runs at a 92% efficiency (including rectifier losses) with just a total of 10 watts of transistor dissipation. Operating levels are 24 volts, 50 amps in and out."
   "Automated systems now perform nearly all the functions of theatrical presentation, including lighting, curtains, sound, background music and projection. It is readily conceivable that multiple theaters could be operated automatically and efficiently from a single remote-control center. The motion-picture projector plays a vital role in these applications. Combined with the extensive use of the projector in other (technical) fields, this suggests the need for an entire new look at projection system design from reel to reel. The characteristics necessary to achieve a high degree of automation and operational flexibility are discussed, and details are given of some methods successfully employed to attain these goals in equipment of recent design. Since the heart of any motion-picture projector is the intermittent film-transport mechanism, considerable emphasis is placed on the role of this device in the projection system."
"The design of an efficient optical condensing system is difficult to achieve, since a high aperture must be provided at the source, while an enlarged image of the source is required at the entrance pupil of the projection lens. The system outlined consists of three basic elements, together with a series of supplementary lenses to accommodate a range of projection lenses from 35 to 300 mm. Besides the requirement for high initial aperture, two additional goals were set: correction for the cosine falloff at the source; and compatibility with all projection lenses in a specified range of f-numbers. These two latter objectives were attained using a field flatness of 10% and an f/2.5 lens which received 90% of the flux at its entrance pupil. These conditions are based on a 50° acceptance angle at the filament of a 1200-W incandescent projection lamp."
"Mission simulation performs a vital function in the Apollo Space Program by providing astronaut training and various engineering simulations. The simulator trainers also provide “full network” simulation, which is the same as a total mission, via a hardware connection with the Mission Control Center in Houston (MCC-H). The Command Module Simulator (CMS), providing a full simulation of all significant spacecraft systems, is described with a delineation of the on-board computer system and the dynamically controlled visual presentations. All simulated systems functions are originated in computer software packages which functionally tie the on-board computer, guidance and navigation, and orbital mechanics together with a dynamic visual presentation via an infinity optics display to supply composite training capability. Realistic visual simulation of the views which would be seen from the spacecraft at any portion of the mission is provided to the astronauts in the simulator trainer."
"Since the first TIROS satellite was launched on April 1, 1960, weather predictions have been based partly on information received from the weather satellites and have been increasingly reliable. How the various satellite systems are operated is briefly reviewed. The results of predictions based on satellite observations are examined in terms of lives and property."
"Previously there were specifications of separate noise-weighting characteristics for monochrome and color TV. A series of subjective tests was designed to study the effects of broadband random noise on 525-line monochrome and NTSC color TV. A single noise-weighting characteristic has been derived which satisfactorily weights broadband noise shapes (power density vs frequency curves) typical of those found in various TV transmission systems. Both color and monochrome pictures were generated from slides and viewed on 21-in studio monitors at a viewing distance of four times the picture height. A seven-point comment scale, ranging from “not perceptible” to “extremely objectionable,” was used to obtain the observer responses. The distributions obtained from the data describe the spread of observer opinion as a function of noise level for each of the classes."
"A projector which simplifies the handling of 2 by 2-in slides for news and spot commercials in TV broadcasting has been designed to operate with linear magazines containing 40 slides or with a circular magazine having 120 slide compartments. A vertically oriented dual-channel optical system is provided; the light from the upper and lower channels is alternately directed into a single projection lens by means of an optical multiplexing arrangement. An auxiliary path in the optical system produces a preview image of the next slide to be projected on a translucent screen at the projector. Flexibility of programing and reliability of operation were the key considerations in the design of the solid-state circuits which control the operation of the slide projector."
"Recently developed Plumbicons display increased sensitivity, longer wavelength response, higher resolution, less lag, extended dynamic range, and smaller size. The TV camera designer is now able to choose among three sizes of lead oxide camera tubes—30-mm, 1-in, and ⅝-in; two wavelength sensitivities — standard and extended-red; and four electron-optics configurations — all-magnetic, all-electrostatic focus and deflection, and their combinations. There is a thin, evaporated, polycrystalline, photosensitive layer of PbO in the Plumbicon which behaves as if it were a layer of closely packed, reverse-biased, wide-gap nearly intrinsic photodiodes with blocking contacts. The influence of the resulting characteristics on camera-tube performance is discussed. A description is given of the principles, properties and capabilities of the technique of “flyback highlight discharge,” which permits extending the dynamic range of a Plumbicon adjustably upward by several orders of magnitude."
"Squeegees are used to reduce the amount of liquid carried over from one solution tank to the next during continuous film processing. Several types of squeegees are used, such as air, vacuum, wringer sling, wiper blade and rotary buffer squeegees. The general principles of squeegee location are reviewed from the viewpoint of photographic results, replenisher rates, washing efficiency, pollution potential cost savings and machine speeds."
"Molded squeegee blades have been introduced in the photo-finishing trade as final squeegees on paper products to remove surface moisture just prior to drying. They are also being tested as crossover squeegees on paper and film processors to reduce solution carry-out and contamination, and thus reduce replenisher rates. A third use under investigation is the improvement of uniformity by submerged agitation. — The blades have been used on film from 8-mm to 14-in wide and on paper from 3.5- to 10.625-in wide with satisfactory results. No product damage was reported, and the blades have longer life and give better wiping than previous squeegee blades. The blades are a molded resilient solid polyurethane, which has good resistance to tear and abrasion and is compatible with photographic processing solutions. The present rocket shape has a 30° wiping edge, flat sides, and a flared base to fit the standard Kodak Squeegee bracket. — A statistical study was conducted to determine the optimum parameters for blade design and installation. Efficiency studies have shown that properly aligned blades can remove up to 95% of the moisture carried on the surface of photographic film. In addition, the tension increase caused by a pair of squeegee blades on 35mm film is in the range of only one fourth to one-half ounce."
"It is often required to know the linear speed of motion-picture film. When a sprocket-drive machine is utilized, it is a relatively simple operation to install a tachometer generator and indicator. However, in the case of friction-drive machines, a simple monitoring of the machine motor gives only an approximate speed, due to film slippage and machine overdrive. One method to indicate speed on a friction-drive machine is to use a metering spool in conjunction with a pinch roller and a tach generator; however, this approach is not too safe or reliable. In an attempt to overcome these problems, a “skip-tooth” sprocket has been designed which is free wheeling and does not place any drag on the film. To this sprocket a slotted disc is attached which acts as a chopper for a reflected light beam. The chopped beam is then converted to an electric current which is displayed on a meter calibrated to read directly in feet per minute of film travel."
               "Originally the video-tape recorder served as a replacement for television film recordings (kinescopes), which, in the case of live telecasts, provided in the more western time zones program material that was too little and too late. Its use as a studio production tool was not seriously considered until after it had been widely accepted for delayed-program broadcasting."
"A phase-modulated data signal for recording TV frame numbers on the cue audio track is described. Each frame period includes a series of binary-coded decimal (BCD) numbers arranged in hours, minutes, seconds and frames, and an additional data period for logging information. Also included is a synchronizing interval which marks the end of each frame, and from which tape speed and direction are sensed. Preamplifier requirements for playback over a wide speed range are discussed."
"A new proposal for an industry standard code for video-tape editing and control is needed to replace the various codes now used, not one of which is compatible with another. The code must contain sufficient information to unambiguously locate any desired video frame within a reel of tape, and should be self-contained on a single audio track. The method used is a biphase space modulation employing 16 bits of control data in each code frame. These control bits can consist of a single 16-bit binary number, two American National Standard Code for Information Interchange (ANSCII) standard alphanumeric characters, four binary-coded decimal (BCD) numbers, or some other arbitrary code combination. Since each code frame is uniquely identified, the control information can be compound coded using successive frames. The effect of changing to a standardized code and the feasibility of code conversion equipment are discussed."
"A time code, found to be compatible with present video-tape, audio-cue systems at all tape handling speeds, is written once every second with a start pulse to identify every 1 s of information with a gated parity check. Once the signal has been decoded and channeled to the appropriate counter in forward or reverse, it may be read off the readout device. In the play mode, the counter reads off 1 s of information and preloads the counter before counting all following information from a division of the control track. The automatic search facility consists of a memory bank which is preloaded by a numeric keyboard. Shuttling is accomplished by an overload comparator which moves the machine past the desired point to the lower-count side, where the machine is put into play to run back up to the selected spot. There is also a comparator to give a relay closure on an exact tape count. This may be used to start another video- or audio-tape machine."
"The visual frame-number generator gives the video-tape editor the same facility as his counterpart in the film industry — the ability to assemble final program material by eye. This is achieved by dubbing wanted takes onto a helical scan video-tape machine via a device which keys in the frame numbers derived from the code on the master material. The generator has no controls, everything being pre-set. The inputs are the commercial power lines, composite video, color or monochrome and of any line standard, and the binary-coded decimal (BCD) information obtained from the code on the master tape. The output is composite video with keyed visual frame numbers and a time display."
"The system has the capability of assembling complete program segments automatically from a random collection of raw footage, such as is frequently obtained when a single camera has been employed to record on a shot-by-shot basis, a commonplace in the motion-picture industry. The system incorporates automatic frame-location circuitry; completely automatic circuitry for edit-point control, both audio and video; automatic dissolving facilities, with frame accuracy over a very wide range of dissolve rates; and the capacity for synchronizing audio with video. Provision is also made for machine language input and machine language logging of system operations, with printout of a hand-copy log. The system may be completely preprogramed, leaving the operator free to tend to quality-control monitoring."
"A time code recorded in the cue track of video tape recordings may be utilized to search for points in the recordings at which edits are to be made, and then to control the operation of electronic editing equipment, to preview and make the edits. In designing a code for this purpose the function of the code must be defined, and the characteristics, capabilities and limitations of video tape recording equipment must be considered. Codes used in indexing, search and control on other types of magnetic tape recorders were examined, and one of these — IRIG B — was selected as a model. This code, with some modification, meets all the requirements in the video-tape editing application. The Vidicue time code system is unaffected by tape speed, insensitive to frequency or phase change, self clocking, and easily distributed. It has minimum interface requirements, failsafe features, and utilizes proven search and control techniques. Since there is nothing proprietary about this code, it is proposed for consideration as a standard code by the industry."
"The Current Interest in new systems for editing video-tape recordings is reflected in the papers published in this issue of the Journal. Several of these papers were given at the Society's 106th Technical Conference where their presentation was followed by a panel discussion of the subject. A transcript of that discussion is presented below. It is hoped that the questions raised and the answers given will supplement, and add perspective to, the papers presented by the proponents of the various systems."
"One of the most accurate electromechanical position-sensing instruments available is a compact tension transducer in which the vagaries of film-handling equipment are revealed for meticulous scrutiny. As a result of the well-planned mechanical construction of this transducer, its casual use is surprisingly free of the errors in angular relationships and random friction excesses generally associated with informal testing. This makes it an invaluable adjunctive aid to the development engineer, who normally cannot afford the time and cost involved in special fixturing for transistory or small-run physical testing. Nominal tensions can be instantly meter read, while transient disturbances of significant bandwidth (with respect to film-transport systems) are readily tabulated with the aid of slight additional instrumentation."
"A high-resolution, 2-in return beam vidicon (RBV) television camera and a laser beam image reproducer (LBIR) have been selected by RCA as major components in an Earth Resources Satellite System. As part of a data handling study for the U.S. Department of the Interior, the RBV camera and LBIR were used to reproduce color picture transparencies to determine how well the camera/laser system could reproduce picture content, both photometrically and geometrically, and hence provide an indication as to what could be expected from its application in space observation systems. Fifteen color IR and Ektachrome transparencies, representing a wide variety of Gemini, Apollo and aerial photos, were selected for reproduction. Each transparency was mounted on a light source, and pictures were taken by the TV camera using in turn red, blue and green filters. Each video picture was transmitted to the laser reproducer and recorded on Hyscan film. This provided sets of color separation negatives which could be processed and registered using dye transfer techniques to form multicolor composites. An evaluation of these color prints indicates that the vidicon/Iaser system has the capability of reproducing to a high degree the photometric and geometric fidelity of the original scene; the high-resolution capability of the system enables the reproduction of much detail. Besides describing the features and operation of the RBV/-LBIR that make an effective observation system, the picture processing techniques are discussed and typical picture outputs are presented."
"The alternating gradient synchroton (AGS) supplies high-energy particles that are beamed on a target. The particles of interest are focused and steered by magnets through the visible volume of the bubble chamber. Chambers are usually filled with liquid hydrogen, which serves as a target for the incoming particles. To make a chamber sensitive to radiation, a piston is quickly raised, reducing the chamber pressure below the vapor pressure of the liquid, and thus superheating the liquid hydrogen. If, during this time, particles from the accelerator are passed through the chamber, the resulting interactions will nucleate boiling and leave bubble tracks along their paths. After a time delay which enables the bubbles to grow to the proper size, a xenon strobe tube is flashed, and the tracks are photographed. Tracks appear in the chamber as dark spots on a bright background. To increase picture production, chambers are operated in a multipulse mode. A Wilkins-type camera and fast data box enable advancing and tagging a single frame of film, on demand, in less than 100 ms. The fast advance is effected when a blast of air pushes the film into a cup-shaped transfer pocket. Typically, 6 in of 70mm film is advanced in 30 ms."
"The television system for Surveyor spacecraft is required to operate over a wide temperature range in the lunar environment for the duration of a lunar day, i.e., 14 Earth days. Periodic assessment of performance is demanded in order to ensure the quality of the received data. In the early stages of system design, it became apparent that a postlanding calibration scheme was needed which would incorporate a reasonable number of parameters to characterize the system, including, at the very least, those influenced by temperature variations. A TV reflectance test chart was designed for Surveyor after studying all the necessary parameters. The finally selected chart design permitted an evaluation of resolution and photometric and colorimetric response, as well as angular position of the Sun with respect to the chart face."
                 "High motivation of adults to learn new languages, plus reduction of learning time, is the promise of a new method of spoken language training. It uses short (15 s to 1 min) 16mm sound film loops, plus multiple soundtracks (optical and magnetic) operating through a multichannel sound projector-viewer. The student-trainee wears a stereo headset with microphone and post-lip syncs his voice to the actors shown on the screen. He then becomes his own monitor-corrector by stereo headset comparison of original (optical) soundtrack and his (magnetic) soundtrack."
"A system using three cameras which allows continuous film recording of seminars, lectures or classes with practically no disturbance to the audience has been developed. The cameras are placed among the audience to provide the best possible photographic angles of the speakers. Each camera functions independently of the others. When a camera is started, a self-contained electronic unit flashes the camera's fogging lamp in a predetermined code while transmitting this same code to the film recorders. At the recorder, this coded signal is received and recorded on a center “control” track through one side of a special dual head; it in no way interferes with the audio program, which is recorded through the second head on a standard edge track. This function clearly identifies each camera during electronic slating without obliterating any portion of the audio program. Each camera, with its own identity code, can operate independently and will be coded, in sync, whenever it starts. Since at least one of the cameras is running at all times, the changing of magazines between “takes” affords continuous filming. The cameramen are in constant wireless radio communications with each other. By simply cutting from one camera to another and allowing some overlap, a wide variety of angles can be achieved to produce a good film."
"Subjective color has been produced by animation techniques without the use of any special equipment. Color coding charts indicate the black-and-white sequences (or codes) necessary to cause either an entire scene or specific areas to appear in the selected subjective colors. Animation cells are prepared following certain layout techniques so that the areas of the image to be colored are dark on one cell and light on others. In the case of motion-picture film, the cells are shot in the desired sequence (one frame at a time) on a film animation stand. In the case of television, electronic editing equipment, used with a black-and-white TV camera, records the animation cells frame by frame on videotape. When the black-and-white motion-picture film is projected or the monochrome videotape is played back on a black-and-white TV receiver a flashing subjective color picture appears on the screen."
"Many times when titles are added over a second background picture, visibility is poor. This is because the background scene conflicts in detail or in contrast with the title which is to be added. It has been found that the addition of an outline discretely surrounding each letter of the title improves visibility many fold, disregarding the information contained in the background."
"For broadcasting monochrome TV programs, Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) has been using a screen process in which video signals are projected by Eidophor. When these programs were to be rebroadcast in color, it was found that the screen brightness was insufficient for the color camera; therefore, color slides were used. However, this method also proved inadequate, because, although it required considerable time and effort to improve the brightness, the pictures turned out unsatisfactory in other respects. To overcome this, the “Lumiscope” was developed in 1967. The Lumiscope is a 1010- × 1320-mm lens made of sheet plastic which is capable of focusing the light from the projector into the camera without reducing the side-edge luminance. At the same time, it ensures a gain some hundreds of times greater than that obtainable from a conventional screen. This high-gain screen has been incorporated in a system called the “Videoscope,” consisting of camera, lens screen, and a projection-type color TV receiver which contains three picture tubes (one for each primary color) and red- and blue-reflecting dichroic mirrors. With the Videoscope system, it is possible to project any arbitrary color video signal with high brightness, at low cost, and under stable operation."
"A CATV system can be converted into an integrated CATV/Pay TV/Audience Rating/Audience Response system by providing for two-way transmission on the cable network and connecting, at each home TV set, a program selector unit that is arranged to generate signals indicative of the program selected and also subscriber response signals for TV shopping, opinion surveys, TV auctions, etc. These identification and response signals are sent back down the cable network to a central office interrogation system which is computer-controlled. A proposed design that meets specified system requirements for these new services would cost approximately $50 per subscriber more than a CATV system alone."
"A method of wet printing on an optical step printer is described, wherein the negative is completely submerged in the wetting liquid during the printing cycle. This technique overcomes the problems of non-wetting, streaking and splice interference, often encountered in the dip tank or felt application of the liquid to the surface of the film."
"The super-8 system was commercially introduced in 1965. Coincident with this introduction, proposals to standardize film and equipment were made to the SMPTE, followed by proposals for international recommendations. Commercial acceptance has traditionally been a guideline for national standardization to insure that through practical experience the dimensions and specifications are reasonably valid. To obtain equivalent reliability, the early standardization of the super-8 system required the prerequisite of an informed industry. National standards have been approved on almost all of the 29 subjects of the super-8 system originally considered as standard proposals. Most of the remaining subjects have received engineering committee consideration and are in the final stages of approval. There is considerable feeling in the industry that there is insufficient standardization, principally in the use of super-8 sound film in cassette or cartridge projection systems. The SMPTE is expected to guide the establishment of standards; however, the Society cannot become involved in the comparative rating of competitive items."
"The terms and definitions presented here were developed by the Nomenclature Subcommittee of the SMPTE Magnetic Video Tape Recording Engineering Committee. The committee is continuing to develop additional terms in this field, and these will also be published in groups similar to this one as accord is reached."
"For critical evaluation of television picture quality, all factors affecting the perception of colors and brightness should be closely controlled. CTP-2 specifies the chromaticity and luminance of reference white, surround light and other general viewing conditions."
            "During 1969 advances in motion-picture and television engineering kept pace with the historic events that closed one of the most awesome decades in history. Without the tremendous strides in photo-instrumentation, television and specially designed cameras, the Moon- Walk could not have taken place as it did and certainly it could not have been vicariously participated in by the millions of viewers who watched “live” the slow descent from the space capsule and the first stumbling steps of man on tnily alien soil."
"A fully automatic tape-splicing device has been developed, with the unique feature that it does not require the use of two or more VTRs. A two-track stereophonic audio head, mounted on a vibrating arm, is set in motion across the moving tape. A magnetized knife-edge, held in place above the tape, serves as the reference point. Positive- or negative-going pulses are generated, depending upon whether the edit pulse lies to the right or left of the knife-edge. These output signals are fed back to a tape transport mechanism, which alters its motion accordingly until the signal from a computer falls to zero and the tape stops in the correct position for cutting. The entire operation takes 20 seconds."
"Until a few years ago, prints for TV from anamorphic negatives were made from scanned internegatives obtained from an interpositive. A printer has been developed which can pan and scan directly to color positive from the original negative, at the same time that other effects are inserted. The equipment can also be applied to the production of reversal internegatives. Because of the illumination optics involved, and the unusual length of the deanamorphosing lens, it has been found advisable to leave the copy lens on the optical axis, and to accomplish the scanning by moving the receiving head back and forth. Since the printing is carried out using a wet process, it is necessary to scan “on the fly,” i.e., without stopping the printer. To this end, the 35mm film movement is swung within the space of the positive head or camera. A single sprocket, located on the optical centerline, is employed to act both as the feed and the take-up."
"As illustrations of the economies possible using the system described in “Television Aids to Film Production — New Version in a Mobile Film Unit” by Mike Metcalfe and Geoff Ptyke (Journal, pp. 7079–7082, Dec. 1969), data available from a studio production and also from a hotel location in London are shown below. This information was received too late for publication in December."
              "In the early days of television broadcasting, motion-picture film was the only medium upon which television programs could be recorded. It was not until the advent of the first practical video-tape recording system in 1956 that a second recording medium became available. At the present time, both motion-picture film and video tape are used in all phases of television production and distribution. — This paper reviews the application of both of these media in the recording of television programs from the pre-video-tape days up to the present time. The reasons for the selection of one recording system over the other for various types of television programs are examined and some directions for future development are suggested."
"It is a special pleasure to introduce an extensive group of papers dealing with high-speed photography and photographic instrumentation. This emphasis is appropriate for July, 1970, for this Journal will reach members only a few weeks before the opening of the 9th International Congress on High-speed Photography in Denver beginning August 2nd."
"Detailed motion analyses represent a powerful tool for studying the characteristics of energetic dynamic events such as hypervelocity impacts and explosions. Techniques for evaluating and correcting systematic errors in rotating mirror framing camera records and for improving data analysis methods have been applied to a Beckman & Whitley Model 300 framing camera. Magnification and distortion errors were determined by photographing a precision grid. Precise inter-frame time variations were determined by measuring the angle of rotation of the framing mirror to within 30″ of arc by a reflected laser technique. The use of fiducial markers, specialized film measurement techniques, and semiautomatic data reduction techniques, have made motion analyses with rotating mirror cameras feasible for a wide range of dynamic event studies."
"A Kerr electrooptical technique that permits direct observation and mapping of distorted high-intensity electric fields has been devised at NBS. Analysis of the field profile from two-dimensional fringe images, similar to those observed in photo-elastic mechanical stress analysis, permits calibration of the Kerr System for measurement of high-voltage pulses, and determination of relative field strength, actual field strength, and potential."
"Radiation pumping of a laser rod causes internal stress upon absorption of any of the radiation. A photographic technique has been developed to simultaneously record these stresses at two focal points, in order to determine the optical quality of lasers used for scientific and industrial research."
"Anomalies occurring in laser experiments have been documented for evaluation with the aid of motion pictures. One problem involved the need to photographically prove that a nuclear reactor-activated laser was capable of lasing, or firing. A 16mm Fastax camera, focused through a perioscope into the underground reactor chamber, was activated at top speed to obtain six laser-exposed frames, gathering enough data to calculate the gain of the laser system. In another experiment, while testing a laser illuminator in a desert area, the laser beam on the target was characterized by light and dark areas in the laser beam. 16mm techniques have been used to demonstrate the three-dimensional aspects of the spatially-reconstructed hologram image. Film footage was taken to evaluate the laser encoder equipment during operation and testing."
"Holographic motion pictures provide a means for recording and observing transient, dynamic, small-scale events occurring at unpredictable times and locations in a given volume of space. Using an argon ion laser to generate repetitive pulses of 50μs duration at a wavelength of 514.5 nm (5145 Å), holographic movies of living marine plankton organisms were produced by recording a series of in-line holograms at 70 frames/s on 35mm film. The reconstructed holographic images may be viewed with a standard microscope, photographed with a still camera, or copied with a conventional movie camera for subsequent projection. Image resolution of 10 μs was obtained."
"In the past the photographic industry has been unable to synchronize a recording camera to photograph random vibration tests. An optical system with coherent fiber optics has been designed to transfer to the camera the image of the part under test. The distal end of the fiber optics is rigidly affixed to the text fixture, with the proximal end attached to the camera. In this way, the lens vibrates with the part and provides the opportunity to record in real time. The entire random sequence test is photographically documented for engineering evaluation."
"The most readily available and least expensive device used to expose very small areas on film, as required for experiments in image processing, has been found to be the electroluminescent panel (EP). This device has several characteristics that are highly advantageous for use in replacing a tungsten light source and a shutter. The EP luminance output is a function of both the ac driving voltage and frequency and can be turned on and off very rapidly. The EP is available in different spectral emission ranges, allowing flexibility in its use; also the spectral emission can be shifted by driving the EP for a specific application. The spectral output, with reference to how it is affected by driving voltage and frequency, is discussed and the spectral match between the film and the EP is shown. Photographs are used to show in detail the results of the EP binary light source and how it has been used in image processing."
"Measuring the growth of a cloud is a necessity in many current cloud studies. The ideal location for the observer who performs this task is aboard an airplane in continuous flight around the cloud. His record mainly consists of time-lapse photographs, and some means of locating the aircraft at the time each photograph was taken. The location of the aircraft in this case, was determined by means of its Doppler navigation equipment. The technique used to analyze the photographs, process the navigational information and obtain the desired measurements of the clouds is described. The various problems inherent in this method are considered, and results of its application are presented."
"The design of a spacecraft television system must be selected from many parameters while seeking to optimize performance and reliability with respect to weight and complexity, within the constraints of existing technology. The slow-scan TV system employing a vidicon photosensor uses a mechanical shutter which allows the vidicon to effectively store the scene image and perform the readout sequence at a much reduced rate. Digital encoding of the analog video signal prior to recording preserves the high signal-to-noise ratio and eliminates signal degradation in the Earth-spacecraft downlink. Future trends are described which involve improvements in sensors, data encoding and storage. Various types of television systems considered for future planetary missions are discussed.*"
"The Surveyor TV system was designed to obtain panoramic images of the lunar terrain from a spacecraft-landed position. The televised images provided photometric and photogrammetric information about the lunar surface, in addition to serving as the feedback loop necessary to complete other onboard scientific experiments. A photon-integration mode of vidicon camera operation was included in the Surveyor Television System to provide the necessary increase in sensitivity to obtain television images during lunar sunset and earthshine-illuminated operations. By utilizing the unique image-storage capabilities of a slow-scan vidicon, exposures of as long as 30 min in duration were possible. Scene luminance levels on the order of 0.008 fL provided usable vidicon target exposures. The principal limitation of integration time was found to be the rate of dark current buildup. Accurate prelaunch camera calibration provided the necessary camera teristic data to allow the resultant TV pictures to be corrected for dark and other vidicon-induced distortions.*"
"The communication system considerations of the Apollo space program limits the bandwidth available for TV signals to 0.5 MHz. Consequently, the Apollo black-and-white TV cameras operate at slow scan rates. The Command Module camera operates at ten frames/s and the Lunar Surveying camera produces one frame in 1.6 s. Both cameras are non-interlaced. The signals as received on the ground are not compatible with the standard broadcast rates, and scan conversion is required to convert to standard EIA format video signals suitable for transmission over commercial broadcast networks. The scan converter primarily consists of a kinescope which displays the slow-scan video, a vidicon camera which stores and converts the information to broadcast field and line rates, and a magnetic disc recorder which stores and repeatedly plays back the broadcast video. A detailed discussion of the various features and performance of the scan converter is presented, including incorporated image-enhancement techniques, pictures through the system, comments on actual performance and potential for improvement."
                "NASA Engineers at the Kennedy Space Center required a more effective floodlighting system to illuminate Launch Complex 39 for photographic monitoring and review of the fueling, final checkout, and launching. Searchlights currently being manufactured used a 20-kW liquid-cooled xenon lamp. The 30-in xenon searchlight and its application in the space program are described. Performance characteristics of the searchlight, xenon lamp and illumination levels obtained for photography and TV on the launch complex are presented."
"In all applications of simulation, especially in the fields of aircrew and manned-spaceflight training, it is universally accepted that the greatest single obstacle is the lack of visual displays of satisfactory realism. The recently developed Focus Projection and Scanning (FPS) vidicon provides an ideal means for generating the required high-definition signal. Incorporating new camera circuits and an experimental 2000-scan-line (30-frames/s) camera, the FPS is capable of about 5 arc min of resolution in a 60 × 60° field of view, with a resulting real-time simulation which closely approximates the “real world” visual situation. A description of this system is accompanied by quantitative test results and several photographs. At present, work is in progress to extend the system's capabilities upward by a factor of 2 to 2.5 to permit identical visual simulation acuity for a 120 to 150 × 60° field of view."
"The means of converting a scene to be televised to a color video signal usable in either CCTV or broadcast facilities is described. The optical system for both “live” and “film” reproduction is discussed including the striped filters, the objective lens and the field lens requirements. There are unusual requirements for the deflection and electrical potentials on the pickup tube; the need for and means of accomplishment of deflection linearity, uniformity of resolution and lack of size and centering change are discussed. The SNR of the system must be very good to provide satisfactory results. The output from the camera has luminance information as well as color information on subcarriers, which must be handled in the normal video pass-band and processed to provide NTSC-compatible or NTSC signals. The option of providing internal sync signals to provide a completely self-contained system (except for power) is described."
"The electroluminescent diode provides a new means to optically record sound at very low power and in close quarters. It presents a challenge of its own to record in a variable-density system with a source of unusual characteristics. The application of this work to 8mm color film is described along with the results obtained using the diode in its original and in a modified form. The results of a simple expression for predicting the frequency behavior are also given."
"A 16mm liquid gate has been built for use in an Acme Optical Printer. Thin liquid layers at the windows provide tight film positioning in this total immersion gate. Film rides between rails, one set of which is compliant for passing splices. Registration pins are fixed. Operational speeds from hold-frame to 640 frames/min (16 ft/min) are possible in either forward or reverse direction; normal operation has been 320 frames/min (8 ft/min). Continuous cleaning is provided by first vacuuming the film as it enters the gate area, then flushing its surfaces with liquid prior to projection. Liquid enters the gate near its windows and leaves through the vacuum slots at either end of the gate. Insweep of air at the gate ends provides a squeegee for liquid removal from the film. The closed support system provides filtered, bubble-free liquid to the gate. Inhibited perchloroethylene is used as the immersion liquid. The gate is easily loaded and used with little change in procedure from normal dry-gate operation."
"A task group on colorimetry was set up under the JCIC Ad Hoc Committee on Color Television to investigate and report on the possibility of standardizing the color rendition characteristics of color television cameras, both live and film. We have defined good color reproduction as: “The reproduced color shall have the same tristimulus values as the original illuminated by Illuminant D6500.” An aim television system which meets this standard for good color has been developed. It is represented by a mathematical model and serves as a standard for the evaluation of real systems. Data for real systems can be put into this model for comparison. Calculations have shown that a camera matrix can compensate for a number of colorimetric errors of television cameras. This computational approach has also been useful in pointing out other problem areas in the colorimetry of television systems."
"As a result of improvements in the color reproduction of color films and color television during the past three years, some revision of the author's previous recommendations for color make-up is advisable. These include the use of No-Color powder, mixtures of the basic colors in the beige-to-olive series, and a new series of colors designated KT-1, KT-2, etc."
"The Final Interim Meetings of CCIR (International Radio Consultative Committee) Study Groups X, XI and XII were held in Geneva, Switzerland, from September 3 to 16, 1969. These were the second interim meetings for the CCIR Period 1966-1969 and were the first Final Interim Meetings of the Study Groups since a reorganization of the CCIR meeting structure was accomplished in 1968. The first interim meetings of the period for these Study Groups were held during May, 1968 at Palma de Mallorca, Spain. The Plenary Assembly of CCIR was held during late January and early February of 1970 in New Delhi, India. The documentation drafted at the two Interim Meetings was approved essentially unchanged at the Plenary Assembly, and complete CCIR publications containing the final documents will be avilable late in 1970. For a summary of the organization and working procedures of CCIR, please refer to Remley, Frederick M., Jr., “CCIR, Oslo, 1966: A Report on International Radio and Television Standardization,” Jour. SMPTE, 76: 42-44, Jan. 1967."
                  "In the development of new audio-visual equipment, design engineers must take the educator in as a partner. Concepts of education must be expanded beyond the traditional “25 students per teacher” and the advanced techniques for the testing and scoring of students. Current philosophies intended to satisfy the individual needs of the gifted, normal and slow student are discussed, including Skinner's “straight-line programing”; Crowder's “branching method”; “single-concept method”; and the “selectivity,” “dial-access,” and “instantaneous review” disciplines. The Panacolor and multi-row film format systems are found to be well suited to most of these modern educational philosophies."
"Video recording on a magnetic medium can be optimized using analog-to-bi-level modulation. The video information is contained in the relative spacing between transitions of the bi-level modulation signal. Quality television displays require a signal-to-noise ratio of 40 dB or greater. Experience has shown that the signal-to-noise performance of a video disc recorder system is essentially that established in the replay of the bi-level signal from the disc. As discussed in this report, when the parameters of the head/disc interface are available for “adjustment,” it is important to have a better understanding of the relative effects of each parameter on the overall record/replay operation. By optimizing the record/replay performance of the head/disc combination, the overall system signal-to-noise capabilities are improved. — Information has been derived and combined in this report to provide understanding of the significant parameters and their effect on the overall pulsewidth and bandwidth responses of the system. Factors of magnetic medium thickness, co-ercivity, remanence and self-demagnetization, head-to-medium separation and velocity, head gaplength and write-current risetime have been considered. The effects of these factors on the pulsewidth response of the record/replay channel are used to direct the optimizing of the disc-recorder system performance. Head-to-disc spacing and head gaplength emerge as the present state-of-the-art parameters which contribute most to the determination of the system's pulsewidth and bandwidth responses."
"An experimental television recording and playback system has been designed and built that employs photographic discs as the storage medium. The video and sync are recorded as analog signals on a spiral track. A 12-in diameter disc can store a one-half hour full-bandwidth television program. Initial experiments indicate that copies can be made from a master recording by contact printing. The research was completed before high-quality gas lasers and compatible emulsions were available. Pictorial information from a 16mm motion-picture film was recorded on a plate at 1/16 real time using high-pressure mercury arc sources and a Kerr-cell modulator. Playback was in real time. Details of the reading and playback system are described. Pictures indicating the quality of the television presentation at the conclusion of the research are included."
"Today's trend toward extensive on-the-spot live color broadcasting of news and sports events has pointed up the need for a highly mobile studio-performance color camera. Approximately two and a half years ago a system design was formulated with prime consideration given to the requirement for a compact, rugged, lightweight camera that would be highly mobile and still maintain the high performance and operational features of the studio-type camera. Its small size and light weight were made possible by improved circuit design and new state-of-the-art components and construction techniques. The following items were of particular importance in reducing the size and weight of the system: a 1-in broadcast quality Plumbicon pickup tube; a small-size, lightweight lens with elements of higher light transmission; specialized integrated and thick-film hybrid circuits; computer-type digital control circuits; high-density multi-layer printed circuit cards; and multiplexing techniques enabling the use of triaxial cable"
"In March 1968, a new color reversal internegative stock was introduced by Eastman Kodak Co. to the industry. Technicolor was the first laboratory to install the CRI-1 process. Since this installation, several million feet of 5249 and 7249 have been printed and processed, with steadily improving success. Some of the advantages of the system are given with direct comparisons with existing systems. Wet-gate reduction printing of 7249 reversal internegatives and its effect on television commercials, the quality of 5249 as a protection negative and the use of 5249 as cut negative for release printing are discussed."
"Preservation of motion-picture color film records that have permanent value requires good dye stability as well as the absence of physical defects. These are dependent upon the intrinsic properties of the film itself as well as upon the extrinsic factors of storage conditions. Intrinsic factors covered are the effect of processing and the value of storing silver separation masters. Extrinsic factors discussed are the effects of relative humidity, temperature, light, storage materials and air purity. For long-term preservation, it is recommended that films be stored at 35°F with controlled humidity or in deep freeze units. Alternate packaging recommendations are given which differ in the degree of protection provided and their cost."
 "The following official report prepared for publication in the Proceedings of the Congress is followed by some less formal notes from the Society's Editorial Vice-President."
             "Broadcast-quality copies of quadruplex transverse videotape recordings have been produced in the laboratory by the contact-duplication process. The program material is recorded on high-coercivity tape in a mirror-image format. The oxide surfaces of this master tape and a conventional tape are pressed together and are passed through a transfer field to effect the duplication of the video material, while the audio, cue and control tracks are played back and re-recorded on the slave. Topics discussed include choices of production techniques for obtaining the high-coercivity master recording, comparison of the two basic configurations for a duplicating system, the copy rates obtainable with each of these configurations, and the major parameters to be considered in selecting a copy tape as well as a high-coercivity master. Performance characteristics which can be expected on distribution copies made by the contact duplication technique are presented."
"One dimensional spatial waveforms having electrically controlled periodicity, waveshape and modulation depth are displayed on a cathode ray tube. Linear light modulation is achieved by gating a linearly scanned electron beam with constant amplitude, width and variable duty cycle pulses. Appropriate waveforms can be rapidly selected to evaluate the linearity, transient response or the steady state response of an optical system."
"A vidicon camera and a secondary electron conduction camera were compared on the basis of noise, modulation transfer function at high and low contrasts, sensitivity, response to scene motion and response to bright sources within the field of view. The tests were conducted with underwater resolution charts of 90% and 40% contrast. Since the cameras had different fields of view and video bandwidths, all measurements were made with a 5-MHz cutoff filter with the camera located to give the proper geometrical relationship with the special underwater resolution charts used. The results of these tests led to the conclusion that the vidicon is superior at high scene contrast and brightness, while the SEC camera tube is better at low scene contrast and brightness levels."
"A program of professional film training and education has been initiated within the Dept. of Radio-Television-Film of the School of Communications and Theater. Temple's program is focused entirely upon the use of film as a medium for creative documentary, film journalism, anthropological/ethnographic statements and as a form of cinema verité. The program is housed in a new production center for radio television, theater and journalism programs. Both the facilities and the production hardware have been designed and selected to meet the particular requirements of a program which stresses location cinematography by small, mobile crews, together with the processing, editing, recording and rerecording involved in bringing documentary film productions to completion. Film studies and research courses on the graduate level seek to develop new techniques and approaches to the production of documentary films, and to develop both hardware and production management systems which are appropriate to this kind of film. Research is also conducted into the effectiveness of documentary films with particular audiences."
"A new equipment provides a means of driving motion-picture cameras of various types phase-locked to a crystal oscillator. The equipment incorporates a digital sequential marking system which applies a simple coded signal to the picture and soundtrack at the start and end of each film sequence. The marker signal for the soundtrack is transmitted by radio and the cameraman may use the transmitter to record supplementary verbal identification on the soundtrack. The digital marker system is entirely automatic, and the tape recorder may also be stopped and started automatically, in synchronism with the camera."
"To facilitate film handling, the central arrangement of units into one room has been done with the aid of a new technique of synchronization. This is done instead of having special areas for mixing, sound transfer, double-band projection, etc. The new technique allows the film and television studios to put together in one unit the necessary combination for all the tasks involved in the handling of sound films in a well-arranged and economical manner."
"A low-cost helical-scan color videotape recorder for the broadcaster has many of the features previously found only on quadruples recorders, and provides some features never before found on a videotape recorder. Until recently, most helicalscan videotape recorders introduced time-base errors too large to meet the EIA and FCC broadcast specifications and did not have a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for the discriminating broadcaster, and until recently, electronic editing, color reproduction, missing video information and other similar problems remained unsolved. This helical-scan VTR can record the full NTSC color signal in its original form with a 4.2-MHz bandwidth and excellent signal-to-noise ratio."
"After the Society's receipt of various news reports about Apollo flights, a request was made for a review of some aspects that had not previously been brought together in the Journal. The following has been contributed as supplemental to earlier extensive groups of papers that have appeared in the Journal such as those on the Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter components and system."
"Blowing up l6mm to 35mm is nothing new. The possibilities of the handheld sync camera, small crews and extreme mobility have attracted many producers, directors and cameramen during the last decade. The greatest hindrance for a wider use of 16mm in feature film production has been the loss of picture quality in the blowup process. Very few improvements have been made in this area within the last few years. One step forward was the introduction of Eastman Kodak's Reversal Intermediate Film Type 5249. It brought us one generation closer when using negative."
"This Technical Historical Note was prompted by the questions of a student of film, Tom E. Sinnott, who at that time was working on a paper on depth-of-film perception in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, with emphasis on perceptual psychology. Mr. Sinnott was referred to the author by Prof. Paul Falkenberg of the Institute of Film & Television, School of the Arts, New York University."
"Recently in discussions with a friend, the training officer of a bank chain, I tried to persuade him to retire his soundslide units and let my company switch him over to sound movies."
              "For the Past Decade, the Society has endeavored to keep its membership abreast of advances in space technology through its Journal and Technical Conferences. The Society has continued to take an active part in the technology of motion-picture film and TV imaging as it has been applied to the new horizons of space. We have participated in considerable technological growth since the first pictures were taken in outer space with a handheld camera. We have solved many of the problems involving the handling of film and television in environments of high noise, shock, heat, etc. We have solved problems of handling film in the alien environment of space, not only those concerned with exposure and processing, but also the development of methods of readout and return of stored information to Earth. We have seen sophistications develop in the various methods of handling recorded information. We have proved that information about other planets and the universe can be put into digitalized forms which can be transmitted great distances and converted back to usable picture. This knowledge, attained by the combined efforts of film and TV technology, has helped make the present flights in space a success."
"Spaceborne television has been principally used in a remote instrumentation role. In the Apollo 7 and 8 flights an important additional function was that of public information, which required the use of design methods not customarily employed in spaceborne instrumentation television. The need to minimize the power for the communication link resulted in the choice of modified standards of scanning rates and resolution, which involved a consideration of trade-offs between picture quality and operating bandwidth. The nature of the mission dictated a design for minimum camera weight and minimum volume, with liberal use of integrated circuits. The possibility of operating the camera during the launch phase made it necessary to design for acceptable camera operation in the presence of acceleration and vibration. Since the busy schedule of the astronaut could not include time for camera adjustments, a highly reliable camera with fixed parameters was required."
"Obtaining high-resolution maps of Mars with an orbiter is a formidable task, since very low contrast is expected from the high orbit altitudes to which the spacecraft is constrained by planetary quarantine considerations. Furthermore, the extreme range over which the data must be transmitted severely limits the mapping rate. It is shown how the selection of an imaging system is determined by the scientific mission requirements. Two possible missions and several candidate imaging systems are considered. The method of choosing between these candidates illustrates the important selection criteria, the required trade-offs, and the interactions with the mission and spacecraft design."
"The Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) camera system features a recently developed sensor which is capable of producing images with a resolution of 4500 TV lines. Discussed here are the operation of RCA's 2-in RBV and how its primary assets are compatible with the system requirements of programs such as the Earth Resources Observation Satellite. The RBV combines the advantages of the conventional storage vidicon ASOS photoconductor and the orthicon electron multiplier. The sensor operates in a slow-scan mode and utilizes the modulated return beam as a signal path to decrease the signal noise. The primary assets of this device are an improved lowlight sensitivity, with higher signal-to-noise ratios than can be obtained with a conventional vidicon, coupled with extremely high resolution. The 4500-line video signal generated in the 1-in format is converted into a high-quality hard copy print by the Laser Beam Image Reproducer (LBIR). — The high image retention characteristic of the photoconductor makes possible the slow-scan readout of a high-definition (100-ft ground resolution from satellite altitudes), nonsmeared image in limited bandwidth. Thus, a three-camera electronically shuttered system can be used to simultaneously photograph a given section of the Earth's surface in three different spectral bands. Data produced by the sequential readout of the three cameras, when superimposed, can be used to generate a sharp multispectral image. The high-resolution, low image distortion (geometric integrity, shading, etc.), characteristic of the RBV, results from the integration of the vidicon with a carefully controlled electron optic and deflection system. Distributed focus coils are used to obtain minimum spot size and proper beam landing over the full format. The image quality of the RBV/LBIR's high-resolution, low-noise picture is comparable with ground reproduction of present-day film and data transfer techniques used in unmanned surveillance satellites."
"Waveform testing methods are commonly used to determine the performance of video channels.1,2 These testing methods use the distortion introduced by a channel on a specified test signal as a measure of channel performance. Results are presented of a study on using a 2 T pulse, a waveform that has received increased attention in the U.S. for the evaluation of linear distortion, and an oscilloscope graticule to interpret the pulse response in terms of K-rating for NTSC systems. The K-rating method specifies the performance of a channel in terms of a K-rating factor, which is given in per cent and represents a degree of subjective picture impairment equivalent to that occurring in a channel having a single well-displaced echo of K%. The recent study found that the use of a scaled 2 T pulse graticule on NTSC systems may result in K-ratings that are high by a factor of 1.8. A modified 2 T pulse K-rating graticule based on subjective test data using NTSC signals is presented that maintains the one-to-one correspondence between K-rating and picture impairment caused by a single echo."
"The color and luminance frequency components of the standard NTSC signal are spaced so that band sharing is optimized by interference cancellation using frequency interleaving. The relationship between the color subcarrier and the line scanning rate is such that the chroma sidebands fall into spaces seldom used by the luminance signal. The two types of undesired luminance signals are: (1) low-visibility luminance components resulting from incomplete interference cancellation; and (2) luminance components that are very close in frequency to the chroma sidebands, causing beats or scintillating effects when viewed on the color receiver. This also applies to the noise that may be present with the luminance signal. — The latter problem is the concern of this paper. Unselective aperture equalization can strengthen luminance frequency components and noise in the spectrum that coincide with chroma sidebands. By “combing” the aperture correcting signal, pictures may be enhanced by an amount previously considered impractical without increasing the edge beats or luminance-chroma heterodyning."
"The aim of the color television broadcaster is to provide the viewer with a pleasing picture; however, he has no control over the adjustment of the receiver. To study this important point, a survey was made of the adjustment of thirty home receivers. Brightness range, correlated color temperature of a neutral field and ambient lighting conditions were measured. It was found that the neutral field ranged from 9,000 to 15,000 K on the green side of the daylight locus. Highlight brightness averaged about 17 fL and ambient light reflected from the picture tube about 0.9 fL."
"NTSC color television tests for differential phase and gain in transmission facilities have shown the need for better measurement techniques. Two problems to be solved are the need to readjust the hue control between TV channels and distortion related to changes in average picture level. Dynamic gain may occur in the chrominance signal, the whole signal, or in the luminance and sync signals only. Dynamic phase affects the chrominance signal only. Present differential phase measurements are made with subcarrier levels smaller than the burst signal or chrominance signals of saturated parts of the picture. By adding a variable-amplitude subcarrier signal of constant phase to the variable luminance lines, we can probe the entire range of luminance signal values to detect the presence of distortions sensitive to chrominance amplitude."
"Proposals have been made to international standardizing groups that the color balance of films for television be defined as that balance which produces in the film a metameric match of a gray object in the scene. This criterion has been questioned on the basis that photographic experience leads to the conclusion that a color balance based on exact neutral reproduction does not result in the most pleasing picture. — We have tested this assumption by an experiment in which observers determined the most pleasing Eastman Color print of several scenes from a variety of prints of differing color balance using the paired-comparison viewing method. The neutral balance of each scene, determined from a separate but correlated picture, was compared with the color of the original neutral object. When the prints were viewed with 3600-K projection light, the neutral balance corresponding to the preferred print was colder (more cyan) than the original neutral object. However, when the prints were viewed at 5700 K, with and without ambient light of the same color, the most pleasing picture was obtained when the picture neutral was a metameric match with the object neutral. — We conclude, therefore, that for the Eastman Color system, a metameric gray scale match can be used as a basis for color balance specification."
"A combination roller has been devised with sliding flanges to accommodate both 16 mm and 35/32mm film on the same printing machine. This roller is precisely built and the flanges can be moved to the required film width in a few seconds. The flanges will return to their proper positions within a tolerance of 0.001 in. The roller lands always remain the same diameter, and the flanges remain the same height; the commonly used drop-center combination roller does not have there advantages. The sliding flange roller is of great value on printing machines in film laboratories, particularly when large quantities of 16mm and 35/32mm film are to be printed. This roller has been in successful operation on several additive panel printers for over a year. The sliding flange roller can be used on any laboratory equipment where a combination roller is required."
"Image-Converter tubes such as the electron-optical transducers PIM-UMI1 have a limiting time resolution of about 3 ps which is limited only by the time of establishing the electron image in the plane of the screen.2 This time resolution was obtained in experiments with circular scanning of the image from miniature spark discharges.3 However, circular scanning has not found broad application in the field of physical experimentation, and the method of linear scanning of a slit aperture is now used for studying high-speed processes. Maximum time resolution of electron-optical transducers is reached for a scanning time of 1 to 1.5 ns; pulses of such duration can be applied to the control plates of the electron-optical transducers, the resonance frequencies of which are about 250 to 350 MHz."
"Studying lasers with synchronization and self-synchronization of modes1,2 entails measurements of time intervals of a duration of about 1 ps. The time resolution of conventional oscillographic methods at the present time is limited to approximately 0.3 ns, which is lower by two orders of magnitude than the required value. An original technique, proposed in Refs. 3 and 4, shows that such short durations can be measured by using methods of nonlinear optics. Nevertheless, at the present state of the art, methods of measuring the duration of light pulses, based on the observation of nonlinear optical effects, do not allow a unique determination of the time structure of the radiation.5 A direct solution of this problem can be found only by a direct measuring method. In our opinion the most appropriate technique is electron-optical high-speed photography. The experimental time resolution of this method6 is about 10 ps and, although it does not permit the measurement of ultrashort pulses (only the upper limit or their duration can be determined), it still makes it possible to solve several problems."
"The following reports are based mainly on the minutes of meetings held at the Society's 106th Technical Conference in Los Angeles from September 28 through October 3. One report in particular, that of the Video-Tape Recording Committee (as noted in the report), covers meetings other than that held at the Conference."
"The program for the Winter TV Conference is complete. The program is presented on the following pages. The papers are listed by titles, authors, abstracts in sessions. Program Chairman Hugo A. Bondy and his assistants, and Arrangements Chairman Charles Cannon, have come up with an interesting program for the two-day conference that will go into practical matters affecting broadcasters."
           "The chemicals used in motion-picture film processing are evaluated in terms of typical sewer code and stream standard requirements. Methods are suggested for the reducing of the discharge of wastes, for example by the regeneration of bleach, the recovery of silver, and the use of squeegees. The use of activated-sludge treatment for processing wastes is recommended to reduce the oxygen-demanding chemicals to an acceptable level. Information is cited for estimating the processing waste load in terms of Biochemical Oxygen Demand. Development work on the use of reverse osmosis to recover and reuse the chemicals in the bleach and fixer washes has been described although the practical application of this approach cannot yet be recommended. The minimal amounts of volatile chemicals used in processing are not expected to produce significant air pollution."
"Basic principles and structural diagrams of a complex sound system for large multipurpose halls making wide use of cinema presentation are described."
"Work on the commercial development of a 70mm, 15-perforation motion-picture projector has resulted in the production of four prototype mechanisms. One of these, installed in the Fuji Pavilion at Expo '70, employs a 25,000-W xenon short-arc lamp to project a 15-min, multiple-image motion picture on a screen measuring 43 by 62 ft. One of the difficult technical problems that had to be solved was how to advance the film at 15 perforations/frame, 24 frames/s, with a pulldown time of less than 10 ms, while simultaneously achieving good registration, good film life and mechanical reliability. Possibilities of excessive accelerations and impact forces on the film were matters of concern. The solutions, obtained from mathematical analyses and observations of prototype operation, involved appropriate film-guide design, the use of air jets to assist in forming and picking up the loops, and the incorporation of a mechanical device for producing controlled and accurate registration without perforation damage. A description is given of the behavior of the film as the rolling loop forms, grows, moves toward the gate where the registration takes place, shrinks and finally disappears."
"A new system, designed to produce high-quality motion pictures on screens up to 85 by 120 ft, operates with standard, polyester-based, 70mm motion-picture film, projected at the standard rate of 24 frames/s. To achieve the desired picture quality and brightness within the limitations imposed by grain size and heat energy absorption of existing film, a new large format is employed which utilizes a 15-perforation “pull-across” projector (incorporating a “rolling-loop” film transport described in an accompanying paper) instead of the conventional 5-perforation pulldown. The frame size is 1.91 by 2.74 in Expo 70 visitors will see the first presentation of the system."
"The development of a television projection system using a charge pattern laid down on a deformable oil film by a scanning electron beam has led to a new electron-optical system, and a new light-optical system which permits simultaneous color TV projection compatible with NTSC standards. A demountable projector using coaxial light and electron optics permits electrostatic focus and deflection of the electron spot through 2,000 spot diameters without the requirement of dynamic corrections. Further improvements in the deformable fluid have resulted in a system suitable for use in education, commercial and military TV applications."
"The quality of recording and playback from a broadcast videotape recorder depends greatly upon the dynamic behavior of its servo systems. The amplitude and phase characteristic of a high data sampling rate servo, such as the headwheel and capstan drive system of a quadruplex videotape recorder, can be accurately measured with relatively simple instrumentation. The control command or the frequency and references for the servo system under test are time-modulated by the external disturbance. The tachometer output of the servo system is then synchronously detected with respect to the control command."
"Distortions in TV displays can be traced to distortions of the camera lens, the camera or display raster, or a misalignment between the two rasters. Needs in the near future for higher resolution TV with less distortion will necessitate more accurate scan pattern linearity measurement. If a conventional display scan pattern is examined through a matching stationary film line grating, a moiré interference pattern is produced showing scan line distortions in a vertical direction. Almost any regular scan pattern can be examined by viewing the scan pattern through an undistorted reference film transparency and noting the interference pattern. If a dot pattern equal to the limiting resolution of the TV system is used both as a camera scene and display reference transparency, fringe interference patterns representing both horizontal and vertical distortions are obtained. — A method is proposed and preliminary test results shown to measure the linearity of a TV system. For closed-circuit TV applications, a direct comparison of camera and monitor rasters can be made. Both vertical and horizontal linearity can be determined within one reference film element. Localized variations of display scene linearities can be found so that compensation circuits can be adjusted."
"Since the rapid increase of color programs and color television sets, viewers have been troubled by lack of color uniformity from channel to channel. This is partially because some of the color adjustments, especially color camera and monitor adjustments, still depend on the visual sense of the technician. A new adjustment method eliminates such misadjustments; it consists of adjusting the white balance, contrast hue and saturation of color monitors to obtain a standard picture quality; picking up a color slide by color camera and displaying it on a monitor; and adjusting the camera system comparing the picture on the monitor with a slide placed beside the monitor. Since the human eye can discriminate color differences in detail by comparing them simultaneously, more precise adjustment can be expected."
"The Canadian Telecasting Practices Committee has recommended a standard telecine camera characteristic which is intended to provide television reproduction of color film essentially identical in luminance, hue, and saturation to the original material when the latter is viewed under specific projection and ambient conditions. Calculation of the camera color analysis primaries has been based upon reproduction using present-day phosphor characteristics, rather than the values specified by NTSC. Since the latter permit a greater gamut of color saturation, there has been a reluctance on the part of organizations concerned with television standards in the United States and in Europe to consider a change in primaries to accommodate what may be a temporary limitation in display tube characteristics."
"CTP 5 introduces the concept of the ideal-color-telecine, which is defined in terms of the picture displayed in the film review room (CTP 1). A typical modern phosphor set is used to specify the optical taking characteristics."
"An important link in the chain of factors affecting the printing characteristics of motion-picture color negative has been neglected: the person who exposes the negative. Since negative and positive emulsions, processing conditions and printer criteria can vary, direct printing information may be of little value in reporting to a cinematographer, who must then depend on subjective evaluation of daily rush prints and a kind word from the laboratory contact man. Exposure has been reported in terms of numbers on an arbitrary printer scale. Means for keeping the scale constant in the face of varying conditions is described, and the system is offered as a language of communication between laboratories, cinematographers and photographic-effects technicians"
"This paper outlines the advantages and necessity of controlling viewing conditions for the critical review of color film and pictures on color TV monitors. Practices and standards of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. for the review of color film by-direct projection are given. These are different in several significant respects from formerly used practices and are designed to give subjective response similar to that gotten when the film is viewed on a TV monitor. Viewing conditions for TV monitor pictures are also specified."
              "Electronic Video Recording® (EVR), a system whereby prerecorded audio-video programs may be played through standard television receivers, is described in detail. — Color and monochrome media are compatible on EVR, that is, a color EVR cartridge can be played on a monochrome EVR player and a monochrome cartridge will yield a black-and-white image on a color receiver. Recorded programs are stored in EVR cartridges, measuring 7 inches in diameter, 0.5 inches thick, with a large center hole. The cartridge contains 25 minutes (750 feet) of color video signal using two video tracks, one for luminance information and the other for color. Monochrome programs use only one track at a time, hence the duration would be 50 minutes maximum. The video signal is exposed onto a photographic base (8.75 mm wide and 3-mil thick). The audio signal is recorded on two narrow magnetic stripes on each side of the EVR film. A special high-resolution silver halide film provides an essential interface between the electron beam recording, printing, and playback processes. — The electron beam recorder (EBR) consists of three sections, all under vacuum, plus their requisite circuitry: the film magazine, the film transport, and the electron gun. The master film is recorded by direct electronography. — With each pass of the master film, the wet-gate multiple-head EVR printer produces 16 color programs together with magnetic soundtracks. Film processing is accomplished in black-and-white continuous film developing machines, with special attention given to uniformity of processing and control of granularity. Diazo film has been investigated and found experimentally suitable for EVR duplication printing. A lead from the EVR player is easily attached by handclips to the external antenna terminals of the television set. Then the film cartridge is placed on the player, the television set turned on to a channel that is not broadcasting, and the player starter button pushed. — sThe film automatically threads itself past an electronic sensor that converts the film image to electrical impulses, and then transmits these impulses — along with the sound — into the television set."
"A new stereo photographic system, not involving the use of any form of individual viewing device, is described. A special type of spherically lenticulated film, or equivalent screen-film combination, is used. Photographs produced by the new system exhibit parallax about both the horizontal and vertical axes, in which respect, therefore, they resemble holograms. Due to simplicity of operation, the process is particularly suitable for the amateur photographer, but other useful applications in science and industry can be foreseen."
"The development of high-resolution electron optics for 50- × 50-mm image formats and of electron guns providing a small-diameter electron source has improved the modulation-transfer function of return-beam vidicons to a level competitive with high-definition aerial films. Limitations are imposed when the polarization time is restricted by operational considerations in the single-exposure read-prepare mode of a slow-scan system. Injection of a control potential permits discrimination against the large “haze” component from low-contrast scenes to optimize the current of the reading beam and the signal-to-noise ratio in the video signal output of the electron multiplier. Comparison at a spatial frequency of 100 cycles/mm shows that the high-resolution television camera has a detection efficiency equal to or better than SO-243 high-resolution aerial film, particularly at low contrasts, and can potentially exceed it by an order of magnitude with further development."
"The image sharpness of motion-picture release prints depends not only on the film products in the system, but also on the capability of motion-picture printers to transfer images. As sharper films become available the need increases to know the transfer characteristics of other system components. Modulation Transfer Functions (MTF) have been used to analyze the performance of various films and printers in the Eastman Color super-8 optical release system. — Use of MTF techniques permits one to compute apparent transfer functions for various printing stages and conditions, including step optical, continuous optical, and continuous contact types. The continuous optical and step optical printer transfer were found to be similar at best focus. The continuous contact printer carefully adjusted and maintained resulted in print-through MTF, in the normally viewed frequency region, significantly close to the theoretical limits of 100% transfer for contact printing. However, poor contact adjustment and poor focus yield low print-through transfer characteristics and noticeably unsharp prints. Especially critical is focus in an optical reduction printer. Printing out of focus by as little as 0.002 in can perceptibly degrade super-8 print sharpness."
"A need for a precise TTL exposure measurement accompanied the development of color reversal film. This new exposure system does not electrically introduce film speed and exposure time data into the meter circuit, but instead the data input is achieved by two unique, counter-rotating precision neutral density discs which maintain the illumination level on the photoresistor at a defined reference value. This method allows the photoresistor to work at a predetermined operating point irrespective of exposure data settings and object illumination. A measuring field of about 30% of the filmed area was determined advantageous for the 16mm film. The light to be measured is diverted by a beamsplitter in the viewfinder's light path, where a relay lens projects the light onto the photoresistor. A galvanometer indicates the illumination level on the film. The reduced light during camera operation is electrically compensated by switching bridge-resistors. The power supply for the exposure meter is stabilized and derived from the camera battery. Illumination of the indicator scale is attained through a light collecting prism. This exposure system sets new standards in measuring accuracy with a wide variety of interchangeable lenses."
"A “soft-touch” surface is used on the film-bearing portion of processing rollers in order to accomplish motion-picture film processing with a minimum of process-attributable damage. The need for this development has come from the increased use of multirank 35mm and 16mm films such as 35/32, 35/S8 and 16/S8, the desire to process both 16mm and 35mm films in the same machine, and an increasing concern with soundtrack quality. Conventional processing spools cause edge abrasions or scratches. In the past this edge damage has not been a major problem, since it was outside the normal 35mm or 16mm picture area. The same degree of edge damage on many of the present multirank films would render a high percentage of the processed film unusable. — A multifingered rubber-like soft tire is placed on a flat spool, creating a uniform film-support surface consisting of many soft, flexible fingers. This fingered surface also provides support over the entire width of the film, thereby distributing machine tension and minimizing in-process fluting. These tires may be used to process any 35mm or 16mm format film, perforated or unperforated, in the same machine without physical damage or costly changeovers. U.S. Patent No. 3,493,161, assigned to the Eastman Kodak Co., has been granted on the tire described in this paper."
"During the meeting of the Engineering Committee on Color, opinion on several matters crystallized quite sharply. One was the acceptance of the need for the Recommended Practice for the brightness and color of screens with black surround for viewing film intended for television usage. This Recommended Practice will appear in the Journal soon. Although the high intensity small screen with a low level neutral ambient light surround is being recommended as more representative of the manner in which television is viewed, the use of such systems is still limited and black surround screens will remain in use for some time."
"An abridgment of a paper by Ivan Putora (“The Sharpness Indicator,” Journal, pp. 956–960, Nov. 1969) was especially interesting to the author of this Technical Note since Technicolor Ltd. has used grid images for the assessment of definition for ten years or more. For this reason, it was thought that a Technical Note on this subject might be apropos."
          "A compact optical system has been designed to implement a field/line sequential color camera with a view toward videotelephone use. The basis of the system is a spectral separation prism, using internal dichroic reflectors, which is used with a pickup tube provided with a new form of composite fiber optic/clear glass faceplate. This configuration allows a number of adjacent identical images to be brought into focus in the same plane at the sensitized target surface."
"A complete motion-picture studio has been built as one fully integrated self-sufficient facility for the conception, production and presentation of motion pictures. Preproduction facilities include a design hall for lectures and scenic design presentation, libraries, offices and storage space. Production facilities include three film soundstages, two TV stages, three film-loading rooms, equipment checkout and maintenance spaces, a complete animation studio, special-effects and insert photography rooms and rehearsal halls. Postproduction facilities include 26 editing rooms, ten videotape editing rooms, two sound-transfer rooms, four daily screening rooms, two theaters, a rerecording and dubbing studio, a titles-opticals-printing room, three still photography darkrooms, two negative-handling rooms and vault storage. The soundstages are isolated from one another by six inches of concrete on all sides. Power can be divided equally between three stages, or diverted entirely to one for special heavy lighting requirements. Equipment and production facilities which can be used at this studio, located at UCLA, are described."
"In 1969 There were Created in France an Official Film Archives for the storage and preservation of significant or important films, instituted by the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. The Archive is located at the National Center for Cinematography whose general director, L. Astroux, has placed great importance upon the prominent part the Archives may fulfill not only for cinema but also for television films. This marked the culmination of ten years effort to adapt the vacant property of the Bois d'Arcy Fort, turnrd over by the Ministry of the Army."
"Of all the major international broadcasting organizations in the world, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. is probably the only one which has no 35mm film facilities. The reasons for this decision 20 years ago were many and they made good economic sense — but they also posed many problems. Equipment was substandard when compared with 35mm; while film stocks were adequate, they were the same emulsions as 35mm material. But gradually they were improved to the point where, today, the available equipment, facilities and materials are completely professional. When the CBC converted to color in 1966, the cost saving of 16mm film production when compared to 35mm production was even more pronounced, and the quality was first class."
"The apparent economic advantages of changing from 35mm to 16mm are evaluated in relation to quality of picture and sound. Also considered are the human and economic factors of converting to 16mm equipment."
"Basic standards are derived by pioneers in the field and the resulting documents become part of the foundation of the industry. As the industry matures, however, there is a tendency for the original reasoning behind these standards to be lost or dimmed with time, resulting in loss of respect for certain standards. In the videotape-recording industry, this is most notable in penetration, because of the ease with which the standard may be violated, the lack of immediate dire consequences from its violation, and the superficial advantages which accrue from under-penetration. The technical basis for the SMPTE Recommended Practice which specifies vacuum guide radius and position (hence, penetration), is described and the critical need for adhering strictly to this specification is emphasized. The reasoning behind other standards of the VTR industry, and how the industry benefits from careful respect for these standards, is reviewed."
"Since the publication of Proposed Recommended Practice RP 41,* “Color and Luminance of Review Room Screens Used for l6mm Color Television Prints,” many inquiries have been received for more detailed information regarding the reasons the RP was adopted and whether it entails a change in operating techniques. Following is a review of the background relative to color balance of film and a discussion of the relationship between projection screening and television reproduction."
"This Paper is an Informal progress report of the SMPTE Subcommittee on Video Tape and Audio Time Control Codes."
"When Users of helical recording equipment come together to exchange experiences, no matter what the situation — formal or informal — the most frequently voiced concern goes something like this: “We are using our machines constantly; they are valuable assets. But, when will there be some standards? I receive tapes from outside and I can't play them. Other people tell me that they can't play my tapes. Requests come to us for copies of our recordings but we can't supply them in the format requested. Why doesn't someone do something about it?”"
"The following standard, promulgated by the Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) is presented here for informational purposes. The contents of the paper deal with the specifications of a format for helical video tape recorders making use of ${1\\over 2}$-in magnetic tape. The format is commonly referred to as EIAJ Type I. Equipment making use of this format is currently available in the United States, Canada, Japan and elsewhere but the English language version of the EIAJ standard has only recently become available. It is important to note that, although the contents of the EIAJ Type I format specifications are now under study by the Helical Recording Subcommittee of the SMPTE Video Tape Recording Committee, the publication here of the EIAJ document does not imply approval of its technical content by SMPTE or ANSI. Rather, it is hoped that publication will provide useful information to users of such recording equipment.—Frederick M. Remley, Jr., Chairman, SMPTE Helical Recording Subcommittee of the Videotape Committee."
"Present-day television equipment limitations and viewing conditions impose different and more stringent color balance requirements upon the production of color film for use in this media than for use in theatrical presentation. Furthermore, the electronic processes provide additional steps where, depending upon the control used, either errors in color balance can be introduced, or some corrections for shortcomings in film can be made."
"THIS PAPER explains the technical reasons behind the picture-design adopted for the BKSTS reference leader picture, intended to assist the objective and subjective colour balance control of 16 mm and 35 mm prints in both the film laboratory and the television studio. Four frames of the standard negative are inserted in the leader at the colour reference position of each cut negative roll and the whole roll is then graded to look consistent with the leader picture. The leader picture later helps the telecine operator to adjust the colour balance of his machine. The original test scene was constructed of specified materials and special care was taken to ensure that the 16 mm version had a grey area big enough for easy routine densitometry. Both 16 mm and 35 mm negatives are available as the BKSTS Girl No. 1 (5254) and BKSTS Girl No. 2 (7254), and prints are available graded to Status A neutrality on the Control Square."
 "This Symposium was held on January 31, 1970, as part of the SMPTE Winter Television Conference at Atlanta Ga. Developments during the Symposium have progressed so that several documents and reports are now available for publication in this issue of the Journal."
"The Panel Discussion was held on Juanary 31, 1970 as the concluding session of the Winter Television Conference at Atlanta, Ga. The panelists had previously received questions on various aspects of videotape recording. Many questions dealt directly with the specifics of operational and maintenance problems. Other questions, such as those on standardization and videotape recording theory, were given special study by the panelists to provide a discussion in depth of the theoretical and scientific aspects of videotape recording as well as the technical problems."
             "We're all here because of our common interest in CATV and I'd like to view with you some of what's going on in this very complicated process of evolving assemblance of a broadband cable system. I won't take you by the hand and mince through any romantic telling of how cable TV early got started. I'll also stay away from using “revolutionary technology”, “wave of the future”, “explosive new medium of communications”, and some of those other overworked and unbearably trite references. And I'll do my best not to drown you in a bath of statistics."
"“Catbird seat” is an expression meaning a place of advantage or privilege. Community Antenna Television operators may well consider themselves to be occupying a sort of special CAT-bird seat as their industry evolves rapidly into a new medium of broadband communications. History teaches that change is inevitable, that resistance to it is usually fatal. Broadband communications promises diversity of programing, pinpoint delivery to specific audiences, retention and recall of information and entertainment programs, and a wealth of non-entertainment services that, nevertheless, may employ entertainment techniques of presentation. In short, the motion-picture and television industries face not a threat but a rare opportunity to join the broadband evolution and become a part of a new and exiting era."
"Mr. Taylor: It has been said that engineers can do almost anything, provided that they have sufficient motivation and sufficient funding. The new age in communications is not awaiting technological development. With only a few exceptions, we know how to do what is to be done and how much time in which to do it. However, there is a certain lack of motivation in some places – a sort of hesitation, perhaps, to confront the conununication giants in the market places. This kind of foot dragging is understandable in the face of the unknown and with fear of the legal dragons which may have to be fought; but in a more important sense it arises from a misunderstanding of the essential characteristics of coaxial cable distribution systems."
"The opportunity for distribution of multichannel programing to all areas of the country is becoming a reality via the satellite/ground station technology. The economic viability of such a system, to a large measure, depends on the cost, performance and complexity of the many ground stations that would be required and by the local facilities for distributing those signals to the ultimate user. The Cable Television industry is well suited to provide this latter requirement and to provide the motivation for a favorable solution of the first requirement. The question of two-way transmission, via satellite at these multiple “head-end” locations, becomes a matter of great interest as a long-term consideration. The World Administrative Radio Conference now scheduled to convene in June 1971 in Geneva, Switzerland, may greatly influence this long-term consideration."
"There is an immediate requirement for some CATV systems to originate local programs and other material by April 1, 1971. The various means of preparing material to be used for local program or advertising origination is discussed. Production equipment which has already proven itself and which requires little maintenance is used. In this case it is 16mm. Some of the requirements for a CATV system are described, such as mobility, preplanning, the quality of the system and inter-changeability of the system with other systems."
"A challenge is made to the film industry to develop a complete super-8 film chain for cable television. There are several equipment elements that remain to be developed before super 8 can become a viable and competitive medium for use in local origination and news coverage in cable-television operation. The unique attractions of super 8 for the cable-television industry are assessed and compared to the alternatives of 16mm film and videotape recording. The cable-television industry needs are outlined and projections of system growth throughout the next decade are made. The potential market for such a super-8 system is explored and a typical local origination studio using the super-8 format is proposed."
"There is limited economic incentive for major investments in research and development for automatic cablecasting. The size of the market is relatively small; the demand/supply curve is so steep that the price at which one half of the systems would buy is below that which suppliers will supply. Channel space is still lacking for multiple channel automatic services; the rate of cable system construction will remain depressed until copyright and other regulatory issues are settled. Local live studio operation will absorb the lion's share of available revenues for cablecasting. Many present equipment concepts should be converted to digital printout displays and color added; this will increase revenues for automatic equipment purchases. Better organized advertising programs will be developed for the expanding CATV market to help finance automatic program services."
"The National Cable Television Assoc. has recognized the need for establishing technical standards for CATV program origination. A Standards Committee has been formed to arrive at audio and video engineering standards to protect the interests of the viewing public while avoiding needless economic burdens on the CATV operator. Performance parameters considered for video standards are time-base stability, signal-to-noise ratio, resolution capabilities, synchronizing waveforms, transients, switching techniques and color-encoding methods. Tape format will not be of concern. Some of the recommendations will call for improvements of equipment by the manufacturers. Of major importance is the provision of a means of setting up cameras and encoders to ensure overall color accuracy and camera match without necessitating instrumentation and staffing comparable to that of broadcast stations."
"Cable television systems frequently employ demodulators as part of their head-end equipment which convert the UHF or VHF-TV signal to video. Distortions of this (video) signal cannot generally be corrected. In the case of color TV signals, distortion changes the luminance level; it always is decreased in the case of the negative modulation. Quadrature distortion also is a systematic and fundamental source of differential gain, chrominance gain being reduced as the luminance level increases. When the cable television demodulator and the home receiver both contribute to the distortion, they are additive. The interrelationships of luminance errors and differential gain in terms of both luminance level and chrominance level are outlined for several different IF response characteristics. A new test signal to measure the luminance distortion and its application is discussed. Other methods are reviewed."
"The design of a modular compact three-tube color camera particularly suited for use in cable television includes only the operational features required for CATV origination. The design is based on the prism beam-splitting system and three camera tubes. Either 1-in vidicon or 1-in Plumbicon tubes can be used. Two basic versions can be obtained because of the flexible modular design. The operation of the camera is automatic to a high degree; it is equipped with a 7-in electronic viewfinder and a video switching/audio unit. This unit contains the switches for the viewfinder video and input connectors for an external video signal, intercom headset and program microphone. The standard lens for the camera is a f/1.7, 25–125 mm zoom lens."
"Experience with a broadcast-type four vidicon color film chain has indicated that to maintain good performance, frequent and skilled maintenance is required. A simplified color slide TV camera system has been developed using the flying-spot scanner principle. A recently-developed phosphor for color flying-spot tubes contributed substantially to the picture quality and signal-to-noise ratio improvement over previous color flying-spot cameras. A minimum number of operating adjustments is needed because of the inherent simplicity of a flying-spot camera and because the camera, encoder/matrix and sync generator incorporate circuits which inherently require minimum adjustment. Animation can be provided with polarized slides, if desired. The polarization system, which provides animation, has been designed to minimize unwanted color modulation. Automatic cuing of the slide projector advance mechanism, and an audio channel, can be incorporated."
"Digitally controlled color cameras and a two-way CATV cable make it possible to completely change the operating procedure in the origination of on-the-spot television pickups. Simply, the two-way CATV cable makes it possible to use this link as the “camera cable” between the digitally controlled color camera and its control unit. In the operation of the multiplexed type color camera, signals are sent to and from the CCU on RF carriers. These signals are compatible with those normally transmitted on CATV cable and include video, audio and control signals. The new two-way CATV cable can replace the coaxial-type camera cable, thereby requiring only the camera head to be transported to the field. All other remaining peripheral equipment can then remain in the broadcast center in its controlled environment. This system of operation offers potentially large savings in equipment and manpower. Some of the details of normal color camera control requirements, how the digitally controlled color camera operates, the signals on the coax camera cable and the capability of the two-way CATV cable to handle these signals are reviewed."
"Communications is becoming more and more important as a means to increase efficiency of municipal operations. The availability of a frequency band of a megahertz or so on a passive coaxial cable system can offer a city a sufficient number of communications channels to serve its foreseeable needs for many years in the future. A relatively small size cable without repeater amplifiers can provide an extremely reliable transmission system. The cost is not great considering the capacity and versatility provided. If the cable television operator installs this cable system to be used primarily for commercial purposes, he can allocate a portion of the spectrum to the city as a token of good will. A proposal to provide such a communication medium is a very attractive feature in any package offered to a city in solicitation of a cable television franchise. The applications of this transmission system from the viewpoint of a city government may be classified generally as emergency alarm signalling, voice communications, data communications and slow-scan television."
"Cable TV now serves about 7% of the TV sets in the nation. To increase this to more than 10%, something must be offered urban-subscribers which is not on individual antennas. Distant signals certainly will boost the penetration, but there are reasons to doubt that this alone could put CATV into the 20 million subscriber category. Closed-circuit programing by tape, film, microwave or satellite interconnection seems to be necessary but undeveloped. Feasibility is determined by what added capital costs are needed to be amortized annually to acquire the meter reading revenue and what is realistic to expect the utility industries to pay for a CATV operator. Revenue from specialized communication services could be great enough to lower CATV rates, with consequent increased penetration and an improved position for offering closed-circuit material at compensating extra charges."
"Applications of bidirectional equipment for broadband coaxial cable communications are described. Emphasis is placed on a time-multiplexed, as contrasted with a frequency-multiplexed, system; particular emphasis is placed on actual test situations, including video surveillance, remote origination, educational applications, remote TV channel monitoring, utility-meter reading and burglar and fire alarm monitoring."
"The promise that cable TV holds for the future of communications is multifaceted. Along with the high-quality television signals delivered to the homes many new services will be available. The functions required for these services can be categorized as follows: monitoring, control, keyboard data entry, hard and soft copy output and high-resolution display. The applications offered can be classified as user interactive or noninteractive. To accommodate these new functions, systems will have bidirectional capability and, in many cases, extended bandwidth approaching 300 MHz. Home terminals will have keyboards ranging in size from three or four buttons up to the size of a standard typewriter. Various system considerations are discussed relative to the addition of these new services to cable TV systems."
"Performance specifications for Canadian cable systems applicable at the time of their license renewals are due for issue by the federal Department of Communications. The authors participated on the Canadian Radio Technical Planning Board in the preparation of the final draft version of this regulation, Broadcast Procedure 23, as the Electronic Industries Association representative presenting the receiver manufacturers' viewpoint. The pertinent performance specifications arrived at are reviewed. The rationale leading to the choice of limit values is discussed, along with the effect these may have on subjective receiver operation. Receiver design trends and their effect on CAN operation are discussed. CAN performance characteristics remaining as problems to receiver makers are noted and suggestions made on ways of alleviating the problems."
"The cable TV system serves as a link between the broadcast transmitter and the home receiver. The broadcast transmitter, while not flawless, is usually built and maintained to professional standards. The household television receiver which serves as the final terminal in the television chain is often not maintained with the special technical requirements of cable television in mind. Some of the technical characteristics of CATV systems which affect receiver operation and maintenance are reviewed, with case histories of receiver/cable TV problems presented."

"The propagation of surface waves at the boundary between a piezoelectric crystal and an ideal fluid is investigated. The effect of the fluid on the character of the waves is studied and it is found that for the particular examples considered, propagating waves take the form of leaky waves transfering energy to the fluid medium. The numerical solution for the complex leaky wave velocity is obtained by two methods. One is a straightforward solution of the complex characteristic equation for the velocity; the other is a perturbation scheme that treats the leaky wave as a first-order perturbation on the nonleaky wave associated with surface-wave propagation when the mechanical properties of the fluid are neglected. Comparison of the two methods reveals that the perturbation procedure is very accurate over a broad range of fluid parameters. As an example, the leaky wave phase velocity and attenuation are obtained as functions of direction of propagation on X, Y, and Z cuts of lithium niobate."
"An ultrasonic apparatus and accUiate experimental techniques have been developed for measuring consecutively the bulk velocity of plane compressional and shear waves in samples of porous solid material. The apparatus was developed primarily to study the elastic behavior of rock samples recovered from well bores in the earth as deep as 7800 meters. Appropriate conditions of triaxial st(ess in the range 0-25 000 lbf/in2 (172 × 106 N/m2), fluid saturation, and temperature are imposed on the sample to simulate the surroundings of the parent rock in situ. In the apparatus, two electromechanical transducer cells operating in the frequency range 0.25-5 MHz are placed in direct contact with each end of the sample. Phase-coherent tone-burst pulses are used. The cells contain two sets of piezoelectric ceramic disks. One set generates and detects compressional waves, and the other set serves as the soUice and detector for shear waves, which form by mode conversion at an oil-aluminum interface. The mechanical ·design of the apparatus is based upon sound principles of geometrical acoustics. This method has substantial advantages over existing ones for testing rocks because it has greater accuracy and a shorter testing time. Transit times through nondispersive rocks can be measUied with a resolution of 10-8second. The time formerly required for making separate measurements of compressional and shear wave velocities has been reduced by one half. Velocities and elastic moduli are reported for aluminum, Solenhofen limestone, and Boise sandstone samples under stress."
"A bibliography is presented that attempts to include all publications to date in the field of microwave ultrasonics. The term \"microwave ultrasonics\" is taken here to include all measurements and/or devices utilizing elastic, magnetoelastic, or magnetostatic traveling waves at frequencies of ~300 MHz or greater."
"The nonlinear theory of the amplification of ultrasonic waves of arbitrary amplitude by the electric current in semiconductors is developed in the arproxirnation of small variations of amplitude, shape, and velocity of the wave on the wavelength in space and during the period of oscillation in time. The general equation is derived that determines slow variation of the amplitude of the sound wave of arbitrary shape in space and time, i.e., the continuity equation for sound flux. Also the average local drift velocity of the electrons and the amplitude-dependent correction to the sound velocity are calculated. The \"nonlinear\" sound absorption coefficient entering the continuity equation, the average drift velocity of the electrons, and the nonlinear correction to the sound velocity are directly calculated in three limiting cases: 1) small sound amplitude; 2) large \"overcriticity\"; and 3) large sound amplitude. Then the convenient interpolation formulas that are valid for the arbitrary amplitude of the sound wave are found for these quantities. The problem of generation of higher harmonics at the amplification of a sound wave of large amplitude is considered. It is shown that with the growth of the intensity of the wave, the maximum of the amplification coefficient shifts to the lower frequencies. With the use of the derived continuity equation for sound flux, the distributions of the intensity of sound and of the electric field along the specimen are found for the case of stationary sound amplification in a semiconductor. It is shown that in a finite crystal the nonlinear effects accompanying the sound amplification take place only in a restricted (both from below and from above) region of the voltages on the specimen. Also, it is shown that the finite specimen under sound amplification conditions may posses the S-shaped current-voltage curve."
"A method is described for measuring the phase angle of the piezoelectric coefficient d31 in a ferroelectric ceramic. This method requires only data on the complex electrical admittance of a length-extensional bar resonator. Measurements based on this procedure gave a phase angle on the order of 3° for the piezoelectric constant d31 of the ferroelectric ceramic [Pb0.99 Nb0.02 (Zr0.65 T0.35) 0.98 O3]."

"It is the responsibility of IEEE Technical Committees to prepare functional Test Procedures for the thermal evaluation and classification of the insulation systems used in electric equipment. These Test Procedures involve accelerated thermal aging based on conditions of use and specify tests that the Committees deem pertinent. The objective of these Test Procedures is to provide for the classification of insulation systems for electric equipment in accordance with their temperature limits by test rather than by chemical composition of the component materials of the system. It is recognized that a given insulation system may be used under different conditions of temperature, time, voltage, etc. Therefore, the evaluation of an insulation system involves all of the various parameters of application and use of equipment but not the evaluation of separate component materials. The evaluation of insulating materials and simple combinations thereof is provided for by separate material Test Procedures. It is the purpose of this Guide to provide a general form for the preparation of systems Test Procedures and to suggest the points to be considered by the Technical Committees in the preparation of specific instructions for the thermal evaluation of insulation systems for equipment."
"This is the first revision of this publication, which formalizes the work of the System Controls Subcommittee of the Power System Engineering Committee on the terminology for automatic generation control on electric power systems. The need for standard terminology in this field became apparent after a study of technical papers indicated that many authors were using different definitions for their terms. Requests for the standardization of terms were also received from the operating groups of the large interconnected power systems in this country and Canada. This is the first publication in English devoted specifically to the terminology used in automatic generation control."

"Surface charge accumulation is a phenomenon which is commonly encountered in processes and devices employing dielectric materials. The buildup of surface charge may be an undesirable effect as in the processing of plastic films or a desirable one as in various aspects of electrophotography. In either case, an important means of charge control is by irradiation of the surfaces with gaseous ions from high voltage gas discharges (e.g., Corona) or radioactive sources. It is the purpose of this paper to examine the charging process from the viewpoint of the basic interactions which occur between ions and surfaces in an effort to define the physical properties which determine charge acceptance and retention. We will confine our discussion to the case of positive ions, since only positive ion experiments have been performed. However, the model developed has obvious extensions to the case of negative ions."
"Investigation of the decay characteristics of trapped charges in polymers is of current interest.1–6 In most studies polymer foils are charged with corona or thermal methods up to charge densities of 10−7 C/cm2, and depolarized at rising temperatures. In the present report we discuss results of charge decay from foils charged up to 10−6 c/cm2 with a breakdown method, or with an electron beam. Materials studied were 12.7 and 25.4 μm foils of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyfluoroethylenepropylene (PEP), and polytetrafluoroethylene (TFE). The foils were either nonmetallized or metallized on one surface."
"Although there have been numerous reports on the electrical conduction of nonpolar polymers, even qualitative accounts of the charge carriers are not satisfactory. On the other hand, ionic conduction mechanisms for various polar polymers have been proposed, and evidence for ionic conduction of some polar polymers has been obtained from the negative pressure dependence of conductivity.1"
"In polyethylene and other polymers, the logarithm of the conductivity is proportional to the square root of the electric field strength in the high-field range for sample films as thick as several tens of microns. It is also found that photo-currents are excited in polyethylene by the illumination of near-infrared light and that the electronic conduction is possible at least at high fields. 3 It is suggested in this paper that the Poole-Frenkel effect is the most probable mechanism of the high-field conduction in polyethylene and that it is largely influenced by space charge at intermediate fields. Furthermore, the model proposed here is applied to field calculation in treeing experiments; the calculation suggests that the field distribution near a needle point inserted into polyethylene is substantially different from the static electric field."
"This paper gives a summary of thermally stimulated current studies on corona charged Mylar, (both dry and wet) FEP and TFE Teflon, and field polarized carnauba wax. Further details are given in a recent publication. 1 An understanding of charge storage mechanisms can be expected to lead to a better comprehension of electrical conduction in dielectrics because both are governed by the same phenomena, including dipole orientation, electron, hole and ion trapping, and space charge effects."
"Luminescence in polyethylene, induced by ultraviolet irradiation, has been investigated in order to make clearer the electronic behavior in polymers. Phosphorescence at 77° K was observed and its dependence on crystallinity, oxidation and applied pulsed voltage was studied. These measurements give information concerned with electronic behavior in polyethylene which will be used in high voltage equipment."
"Organic liquids are normally considered to be insulators with the small electrical conduction, which may be a result of impurity and ionic migration.1 Other descriptions of charge transfer include hopping mechanisms, gas evolution,2 and electrohydrodynamical convection,3,4 where as electronic conduction in an organic liquid becomes difficult to identify."
"For voltage levels of 300 kV and above,1,2 oil-impregnated cellulose paper becomes less and less efficient as insulation in underground transmission cables because of the increasing dielectric losses. Above 500 kV cellulose paper will not be applied as a result of prohibitive dielectric loss heat as well as of excessive growth of insulation thickness, so that maintaining both sufficiently low thermal resistance and acceptable bending properties becomes difficult."
"We recently presented a comparison of the economics of paper-oil insulated pipe-type cables with those of a conceptual polymer-fluid cable of similar design for use in the EHV range from 345 to 700 kV.1 In the present work we have extended our calculations to cover a number of other systems currently under consideration for obtaining larger blocks of power at lower cost. These include pressurized SF6 rigid pipe, direct buried (or self-contained) paper-oil, and polymer-fluid and integral cooling of both paper and polymer using flowing water. It is the object of this paper to compare the economics of all these systems under as nearly as possible a consistent set of cost assumptions."
"Since the early days of electricity supply (1890), impregnated paper based cables have been used for transmission and distribution purposes.1 Besides a long record of cable reliability, paper insulation has unique characteristics such as a ruggedness which provides easy taping and subsequent bending of the finished cable and a porous matrix which allows easy flow of the imprégnant assuring a virtually void free composition with a high breakdown strength. However, the inherent electrical properties of the oil impregnated paper composition give rise to a limited power transmission capability for paper-oil insulated power cables at extra high voltage. This limitation has stimulated research on new transmission systems and new materials. This report is concerned with one of these efforts, namely, synthetic paper insulation."
"It is well known that fluorinated gases have a higher electric strength than air or nitrogen, and it is generally accepted that these high values are related to the electro-negative properties of the fluorine atom. Free electrons are readily trapped by fluorine, and so are eliminated from the accelerating process caused by the electric field. This results in a relatively high breakdown strength. It would be interesting to know whether, in fluorocarbon liquids, the same mechanism is active. If the effect of the fluorine atom is as beneficial as in gases, these liquids might find an attractive application as insulating liquids, for the impregnation of lapped synthetic insulation in EHV cables."
"The need for lower dielectric losses in EHV cables has stimulated recent interest in the use of oil-impregnated polymer films in place of paper. To minimize swelling by the oil and resultant degradation of mechanical and electrical properties, polymers with relatively high glass transition temperatures such as polyphenylene oxide, polydian carbonate, and polysulphone have received most attention.1,2 Such glassy materials under a mechanical strain like that which may be induced in a cable either in wrapping the film or in bending the finished cable may develop small crazes or cracks particularly in the presence of oils. In this paper we have examined the tendency of glassy polymers to craze and swell in a number of commonly used cable oils as well as in a number of pure alkanes including the molecular weight range found in these oils. Measurements of dry crazing have also been made as a function of temperature and the influences of annealing and molecular orientation investigated. The results suggest a theory relating crazing to the glass transition temperature which permits quantitative predictions of both dry and solvent crazing."
"In a previous paper1 the dielectric properties of some low loss polymer films in oil were reported as a function of electrical stress and temperature, based on data obtained over relatively short exposure period. At about the same time some initial data from this laboratory and from others showed that extended exposure to elevated temperature and voltage stress caused unexplained increases in dissipation factor for many polymer and oil combinations. Increase in dissipation factor with time was shown to be a problem common to many polymer-oil systems that were exposed to high-voltage stresses (500 V/mil) and elevated temperature (100°C)."
"In a laminated, composite dielectric of polymer and paper, the paper-faced film of polymer behaves like a paper tape mechanically, while the cellulose protects the polymer against the direct effects of discharges which may occur in liquid filled cavities such as the butt spaces. The paper ply also facilitates initial impregnation and its maintenance under thermal cycling."
"The artividial lipid bilayer membrane is an elegant experimental model for the biological membrane. It is a curious kind of dielectric object, an ultrathin liquid hydrocarbon like film (approximately 50 % thick) which is made underwater. After discussing its relation to the biological membrane we survey briefly its ion transport properties."
"With recent development of the field-dependent emitter in liquids,1 many experiments and tests have been performed resulting in a variety of new liquid devices.2,3,4 Mobility measurements5 have shown the predominant charge carrier in hexane to be “ion-like” in nature, but true identification has yet to be accomplished. Among suggestions put forward as models for the carrier, some of the more well-known and documented ones are the formation of an oxygen ion,6 an electron hopping mechanism,7 and the charge-polarized complex or polaron model.8 Also, more recently, electron charge carriers have been observed in highly purified hexane,9 where a mobility at least 50 times those previously observed in hexane was recorded."
"During the past few years there has been a considerable number of theoretical and experimental studies of the physical properties of the solidified gases such as helium, neon, argon, oxygen, and nitrogen. This is because the relatively simple structure of these solids provides an opportunity for constructing theoretical models, and evaluating these models experimentally in a system relatively free of complex phenomena. However, the electrical properties have so far received little attention. From a fundamental viewpoint it might be expected that these solids should behave as prototype solids as far as dielectric phenomena are concerned, and an investigation of their electrical properties could yield information on the mechanisms of breakdown and charge transport in solids in general."
"The difficulty in analyzing transient space-charge-limited (SCL) problems stems from the non-linear character of the partial differential equations which describe such phenomena. For certain types of transients, rigorous solutions can be obtained; in other cases an approximate analysis can be made, using some reasonable assumptions about the form of the space-charge distribution.1"
"The measurement of the real and imaginary components of the dielectric permittivity of a material at microwave frequencies usually involves the determination of phase shift and amplitude change in the Roberts-von Hippel technique1, or the perturbation of resonance in a cavity.2 Disadvantages of the former technique include the complicated mathematics necessary to solve the equations of the system, while the latter technique has only limited application for low-loss materials and requires a careful match between sample shape and cavity. A third method utilizes a traveling-wave probe in the specimen. Although this eliminates most of the mathematics of the Roberts-von Hippel method, it is seldom used because it applies to liquids only. Its accuracy suffers from the necessity of mechanical position measurements, made more difficult by the simultaneous need for seals as well as perfect alignment of the probe. A variation of the technique3 uses a fixed position probe and a variable-length liquid cell."
"It has been shown recently that the very short group relaxation time observed for pure aniline and its solutions may be attributed to the inversion of the nonplanar configuration of the nitrogen bonds.1,2, 3 Tiganik,4 by measuring the static dielectric constants of ortho-, meta-, and para-chloroanilines, has come to the conclusion that the angle between the NHg group and the phenyl ring varies with the location of the substituted chlorine atom. One may expect that the relaxation time and the potential barrier to the inversion is dependent on the magnitude of the angle to be inverted. Further, the self association of anilines through weak hydrogen bonding is dependent on the substitution. In order to gain information on these phenomena the present study was undertaken."
"In order to make optimum use of an epoxy system, one must know, among other things, how it cures under various conditions and to what extent the cure proceeds. Among our current areas of study are the curing and structure, and resultant physical properties, of several common epoxide/hardener systems. This paper investigates the epoxide/amine system, of which bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether/m-phenylene diamine is an example."
"A ferroelectric crystal, below its Curie temperature Tc, is characterized by spontaneously electrically polarized domains. The nature of the domain structure,1 the magnitude and direction of electric polarization in the domain states,2 and many of the macroscopic properties of the single domain3 can be described in terms of a polarization induced “distortion” of a higher symmetry prototype state, the prototype frequently corresponding exactly to the paraelectric structure above Tc."
"There is much current interest in the properties of silicon nitride films that can be used for the passivation of silicon devices. The reaction of silane with ammonia has been used by many workers to produce films with useful dielectric qualities. However, conduction mechanisms in these films are little understood, and electrical instabilities1· have been reported that are associated with impurities introduced during the chemical reaction. This paper is concerned with Si3N4 devices, which have been produced by electron beam evaporation.2 An attempt has been made to evaluate the variables involved in this method of fabrication, which affect aging. Some ac and dc electrical characteristics have been measured and an effort is made to explain conductive and dispersive properties of the devices."
"The insulating properties of dielectric films are of great concern for application in semiconductor devices. A systematic study of the dc conductivity of silicon nitride, silicon dioxide, and their composites has been undertaken using current-voltage measurements on metal-dielectric-silicon devices."
"When dielectrics are used for electrical insulation in vacuum the maximum pulsed field is frequently limited by flashover in the region on or near the surface of the dielectric.1–4 The pulsed field at which surface flashover occurs may be a factor of ten or more below the potential at which volume breakdown occurs. 5 The vacuum at which this phenomenon begins is about an order of magnitude below that required for the Paschen minimum and hence cannot be fully explained in terms of the Paschen relation. 1,2,6 This paper presents results obtained on surface flashover for several insulating materials in a vacuum of 10−5 Torr using pulsed dc voltage."
"It is knownl1–3 that metallic particle contaminants can drastically reduce the breakdown voltage of compressed gases, but relatively little is known of the dependence of this effect on the test conditions, and of the breakdown mechanisms involved."
"It is common experience to observe a reduction in the insulating strength of an insulating liquid, when the space between the electrodes contains a solid insulating support extending between the electrodes. This has been found to be true regardless of the insulating medium and of the insulating support. Major difficulties are encountered in obtaining flashover data for the solid-liquid insulating system. Each flashover drastically changes the insulating properties of the system: the moisture, gas, and carbon content of hydrocarbon liquids are changed, electrode surfaces are modified by the conditioning process and in cases where flashover occurs at the interface, destruction of the surface of a solid organic support usually occurs by tracking, making it unsuitable for further tests. After surface flashover occurs, therefore, the solid support, the insulating liquid, and the electrode surfaces must be replaced or treated."
"The influence of an insulating film or layer placed on one or both electrode surfaces on the breakdown strength of a liquid gap has been investigated using direct voltages by Kaol and Zaky et al.2 Their results indicate that the breakdown strength is increased significantly compared with those obtained using uncoated electrodes. In this paper we report some new results, obtained using linearly rising voltages."
"Mineral oil serves to insulate and cool practically all large power transformers. The transformer oils offered by the various companies are basically similar, but minor variations in the constitution of such oils are found between vendors, and there are continued differences of opinion within the industry as to the most desirable formulation to use. In view of such variations, and the underlying complex composition of oil, it is not surprising that most basic research has been concentrated upon simpler dielectric fluids. Accordingly, the chances of interpreting the many and various breakdown phenomena in liquid-filled high-voltage equipment would be improved if a well-defined alternative to mineral oil were brought into general use."
"Small-scale, uniform-field, 60 Hz breakdown tests have long been used for monitoring the quality of transformer oil. This is because of the sensitivity of such tests to particulate contamination and dissolved water. An especially sensitive test of this type is ASTM Method D1816,1 which employs spherically-capped electrodes of VDE contour. However, this type of test is often insensitive to trace amounts of soluble polar chemical contaminants in oil of otherwise high quality. For example, the breakdown voltage of virgin oil (i.e., uncontaminated and previously unused oil), tested in a 1000-gallon laboratory tank, ranged from 28 to 35 kV rms during one investigation that extended over a period of 16 working days. The electrode spacing was 40 mil. After adding approximately 500 ppm by volume of a chlorinated hydrocarbon (a blend of chlorinated benzenes and chlorinated biphenyls) and repeating the original series of tests, the breakdown voltages for the contaminated oil ranged from 29 to 35 kV over the next 14 days. This test (D1816) obviously detected no difference between the two oils."
"The use of capacitors in electric networks is becoming more and more common. The capacitor remains under the voltage of the network, and in addition it is subjected to various over-voltages appearing in the network. The latter will originate from lightning strokes and more frequently from switching operations. Due to the incompleteness of data on the capacitor dielectric strength under switching surges, the problem became of interest. The lightning and switching surges may cause a weakening of the dielectric strength of many types of equipment. Power capacitors, with their impregnated paper insulation, belong to this category of equipment."
"A prototype, high-voltage transformer was built using Kapton as the primary solid insulation. Corona inception voltages in pressurized Flocool (a silicate ester) were significantly higher than at atmospheric pressure. To remove entrapped air within the transformer, vacuum impregnation was used. Measurements of corona inception were made at vacuum, atmospheric pressure, and 150 psi. Large variations were observed between the two secondary windings. These are attributed to the presence of air even after vacuum impregnation."
"There is a need for short term thermal evaluation of electrical insulation for power equipment. At present thermal evaluation is a one or two year project for new insulation components, and the problem of evaluation is complicated by compatibility of the insulation components that reduce reliability of insulation systems. This deficiency in reliability is controlled in practice by extensive testing. If the time needed for thermal evaluation of electrical insulation can be reduced, this could accelerate the acceptance of new insulation components without the loss of reliability in insulation systems."
"The Lancaster Conference on Dielectrics1 was organized by the Institute of Electrical Engineers, in association with IEEE (U.K. Section), The Institute of Physics, and The Physical Society. The following summary of the Conference is taken from a presentation by E. H. Reynolds, C. W. Reed, T. W. Dakin, and E. O. Forster, given at the 1970 Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena annual meeting held at Pocono Manor, Pennsylvania."

"Conference proceedings front matter may contain various advertisements, welcome messages, committee or program information, and other miscellaneous conference information. This may in some cases also include the cover art, table of contents, copyright statements, title-page or half title-pages, blank pages, venue maps or other general information relating to the conference that was part of the original conference proceedings."
"Presents the table of contents/splash page of the proceedings record."
"The coverage of this chapter and the organization of the material is essentially the same as last year. The subject matter was gathered from Electrical and Electronic Abstracts, Physics Abstracts and direct from the literature. If any general trend is to be discerned in the area of instrumentation and measurement, it is the growing influence of computers and computing techniques. Thus measurement methods are coming into use which rely on the ability of computers to process the data, and instruments are designed to produce output which can be fed directly into computers."
"The tables contain data reported in publications abstracted by Chemical Abstracts for 1970. In most cases the values cited have been taken from the original literature. In cases where the original literature was unavailable, the Chemical Abstracts citation follows the reference. The tables cover measurements on pure materials and dilute solutions but do not include work on mixtures or poorly characterized substances. The following tables are given: 1. Static Dielectric Constants of Pure Liquids 2. Static Dielectric Constants of Pure Solids 3. Dipole Moments 4. Unresolved Relaxation Times 5. Resolved Relaxation Times."
"Advances in understanding the fundamental properties of atoms, molecules and ions constitute a large portion of the 1970 literature on dielectrics. This chapter presents only those papers which make a significant contribution in these areas of dielectric phenomena either through a theoretical analysis or experimental data directed toward a theoretical understanding. Papers that would be more appropriately discussed under the specific titles of other chapters have been omitted."
"This chapter covers electrical conduction in solid and liquid dielectrics and associated physical properties. The exact area covered is not precisely defined; work on amorphous semiconductors appears but that on wide-band crystal semiconductor is generally excluded. Small items are classified according to the state of materials."
"The chapter is arranged in six sections. The first section entitled Primary Properties includes conventional investigations of intrinsic electric strength, thermal breakdown, breakdown of thin films and breakdown in situations which do not involve interaction with ambient media, e. g., laser-induced breakdown. The content of the other sections is evident from their titles. Considerable effort, as in previous years, has been concentrated upon the study of tracking and flashover of polluted insulation but a solution to this problem remains elusive. Interesting developments appear to be the impregnation of polythene by electro-negative gases in order to improve its electric properties. There is also the use of impregnated polymer film and paper-polymer composites in capacitor insulation which permit very appreciable increases in working stress."
"The format of this year's chapter is essentially the same as last year's. In addition to major sections on conduction and breakdown, sections on the following topics are included: technology, fluid motion, electrostatics, and dielectric phenomena. The selection of subject matter in the dielectric phenomena section is based upon its direct or indirect connection with conduction or breakdown. Although the connection may seem obscure in some cases, those concerned will recognize the articles of interest to them. Relaxation behavior is generally excluded from this section, but subjects like opalescence and secondary electron emission are included, in addition to the obviously-important subject of electric field distribution."
"The chapter covers fundamental ionization processes in gases, mobility measurements, breakdown in uniform and nonuniform fields, laser induced breakdown, lightning, and applications of gas breakdown and gaseous insulation. A new section has been added to cover developments in the field of high pressure gas lasers, and the bibliography has been extended to include ion-molecule reactions."
"In September of 1970 the 4th International Symposium on Discharge and Electrical Insulation in Vacuum was held at Waterloo University in Ontario, Canada. While the meeting was somewhat less well attended than previous ones in the series this was not reflected in the many interesting papers which were presented. The listing and discussion of these make up a large part of the material presented in this chapter. Other conferences of importance occurred in London, Munich, and Chicago. The review papers presented at Waterloo involved a wide range of topics (1–6), as can be seen from the titles. Among the important points raised by reviewers was the fact that it has now become very clear that the interpretation of prebreakdown currents using the Fowler-Nordheim (F.N.) equation can be very misleading. This is because of the likely multiplicity of emission sites coupled with the variety of adsorbate states possible on each emitter. The general effect is to lead to a lack of information concerning the emitting area. In order to explain the later stages of the field emission induced breakdown due to the explosion of a cathode emitter it has now been found necessary to consider the emission of electrons from the cathode due to the field generated by the presence of a plasma cloud (explosion created) above the surface; this enhanced emission causes intense anode heating and vapor production. The latter theory is one of many different voltage collapse processes now under review, and is as yet one of the few to have been subjected to as careful an experimental test as has the hypothesis of Davies and Biondi (3, 28, 29). The process proposed by these authors involves the detachment of a high temperature anode region and its subsequent heating in the electron beam as it crosses the gap."
"The papers in this review cover largely the calendar year 1970. It may be noted, further, that the main sources used were Chemical Abstracts, Physics Abstracts, and a direct search of a number of the pertinent polymer journals. Because of some overlapping coverage given to polymers in other chapters, only minimal attention is given here to biopolymers and to applications of polymers as insulating materials, capacitor dielectrics and in electro-coating applications."
"Every attempt has been made to group the papers in the bibliography into precise sections and a total of 29 sections has been used giving fine division of this field of research into insulating films. Papers on Ge and Si and group III-V semiconductors have not been included with the exception of GaN. This material is one of the wider band III-V semiconductors, and interest in GaN has been growing in recent years."
"Electrification due to the contact and separation of materials is an old and familiar phenomenon which has been both a source of interest and a hazard to man and yet has made possible a number of technological advances. The effects of separation electrification are particularly important for those dielectric materials which have a long charge relaxation time. A separation charge of only one electronic charge for every 6 × 104 surface atoms is sufficient to cause air breakdown. Owing to the minute quantity of charge which produces macroscopic effects, progress in controlling separation electrification has been slow. With the increasing availability of instrumentation, measuring techniques, and many synthetic materials, renewed interest and progress toward understanding separation electrification can be expected."
"In this 1970 Digest we commence to mutate the presentation, without departing strongly from the previously established practice, toward a more critical commentary upon the important developments in these related fields of ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and electrooptic materials. To this end we have attempted to be more selective in description, emphasizing the articles which appear to be more important and informative."
"Advances in understanding the dielectric properties of biological substances continue to suffer from sporadic flurries of activity in specific areas that change with temporary fashion. In 1970 there was a relative preponderance of effort on thin lipid layers constructed as analogues to cellular membranes. Some work on proteins, polypeptides and whole cells was also reported. Most of these studies attempt to use dielectric data for structure analysis, a most difficult and often inconclusive procedure."
"1970 was a period of growth and maturing in several areas of technology with a few new product innovations. In cables, EPR is being introduced as a new high voltage insulant in competition with cross-linked polyethylene. Improved filled cross-linked polyethylene is also offered. Several 138 kV polymer dielectric cables are being tested at Waltz Mills The French reduce the thermal resistivity of back fill to 85°C cm/watt and save money by using a smaller conductor. New wire insulations such as Tefzel are offered. PVC jackets which do not give off HCl are made. Extrusion techniques have been improved. A high temperature pinhole-free wire wrap insulation of Kapton-Polyimide is available. Several new materials and techniques have been developed for communications cable."
"A radiometer has been developed in which the spectrum of the noise-like signal is shaped (spectral coding) so that it can be distinguished from the receiver noise by a simple correlation process. This radiometer has a small-signal sensitivity comparable to that of the Dicke (temporally coded) system and an output insensitive to variations in the system gain or front-end temperature. An advantage of the system is the simplicity of the required hardware, leading to the possibility of high reliability. A practical radiometer was constructed to demonstrate the technique."
"A series of tests were performed to investigate the effect of radar ducting on mircowave propagation at four wavelengths: 1, 3, 5, and 12 cm. A boat equipped with the four CW transmitters operated between a few miles and fifty nm off shore. The receiving station was at the shore thirty feet above sea level. Data recorded at the shore site gave signal strength as a function of boat range. Ducting conditions existed part of the time, giving ranges of four to five times the normal, % earth radius horizon. During these conditions, signal strengths as great as 10 db or more above free space were observed out to maximum range. All frequencies gave extended horizons during these conditions. During conditions of near-normal horizon ranges, in the diffraction region the longer wavelength gave larger signals at greater ranges. Signal strength fall-off rate in this region approximated 2 db/nm for each frequency."
"This paper describes point-to-point and radar return attenuation measurements through the atmosphere at a frequency of 15.3 GHz. Clear air fluctuations along a 20-km path were <1.5 db except in unusual situations, such as during a frontal passage or for a strong ground moisture layer occurring just before sunrise. Observations of a general rain showed an attenuationrain rate ratio of 0.1 db/km/mm/hr. Radar observations of a more intense shower showed a relatively small attenuation because of the limited extent of the rain cell."
"An experiment that measures the difference in attenuation of horizontally and vertically polarized fields propagating along a 1.89-km path at 30.9 GHz is discussed. For a rain-induced fade of 18.5 db/km, differences between attenuations in horizontal and vertical polarizations as large as 3 db/km have been observed. There is good agreement when these microwave measurements are compared with calculations based on raindrop shapes that were measured visually by an independent investigator. From the data, we conclude that there are significant differences between attenuations in these polarizations for rain-induced fades and that we should think in terms of an effective rain rate for vertical polarization that is less than that measured by rain gages."
"An integral expression for the current-voltage relationship of a spherical dc probe is derived assuming that the ambient gas pressure is high and that the probe potential is large and negative. The analysis applies to any gas in which the ion velocity is proportional to the applied electric field strength raised to an arbitrary power. A simplified current-voltage relationship applicable to small probes is also derived."
"The distortion of short, quasi-monochromatic VLF pulses by dispersion and multimode propagation in the earth-ionosphere waveguide is studied. The delays between received pulses on three waveguide modes are calculated with a β = 0.5 ionospheric electron-density profile having an ionospheric height of 70 km (day) and 90 km (night). The fractional spreading of short pulses caused by dispersion on individual modes is also calculated. Delays of up to 0.7 msec between pulses arriving on different waveguide modes were obtained. The dispersive spreading on the important modes is only a few percent for a 2-msec pulse."
"An iteration technique used in the computation of topside electron density profiles from topside ionograms of Jackson, 1969, fails to converge for some ionograms. An alternative method of iteration, which converges for all ionograms tested, is suggested."
"Horizontal electric dipole excitation of vertical E at the ground for 19.8-kHz radiation beneath a hypothetical daytime ionosphere and beneath a highly anisotropic ionosphere has been numerically investigated as a function of ground conductivity and source elevation. East to west propagation is considered with a magnetic dip angle of 50°, and full allowance is made for earth curvature and ionospheric anisotropy. In horizontal dipole excitation between a highly anisotropic ionosphere and a good conducting ground, broadside launching, except for sources very close to the ground, is to be preferred to end- on launching. Since TE waves are launched broadside, this is a direct consequence of mode coupling in the ionosphere. For source elevations comparable to or greater than a wavelength, the horizontal and vertical electric dipole excitations can become comparable. In excitation by a horizontal electric dipole beneath a daytime ionosphere, end-on launching is to be preferred to broadside launching for a ground-based horizontal dipole exciter. However, for an elevated horizontal dipole source, the preferred direction of launch depends upon the ground conductivity as well as transmitterreceiver distance. Thus, even with weak ionospheric anisotropy, mode coupling can be significant. Up to elevations of 40 km (the highest considered in this paper), the elevated vertical dipole is a more efficient source of vertical E at the ground than is the elevated horizontal dipole."
"The propagation of electromagnetic waves in the VLF range in the earth-ionosphere waveguide has been theoretically analyzed. The results of full-wave calculations indicate that transpolar VLF waves suffer considerably more attenuation during a moderately strong polarcap absorption (PCA) event than during the undisturbed daytime. Computed height profiles of dissipation and field strengths show clearly that this increased attenuation is due mainly to ohmic losses associated with ion heating. Calculations based on a model of a relatively weak PCA event indicate no pronounced increase in attenuation at most VLF frequencies. For this model, ions are found not to be an important factor. The calculations do not include the possible effects of the Greenland ice cap. During a moderately strong PCA event, the height range over which long-path VLF waves interact strongly with the ionosphere is substantially lower than in the undisturbed daytime. For all ionospheric models considered, the width of the height range of substantial wave-ionosphere interaction at a given frequency was less than about 20 km. VLF probing experiments must therefore use several frequencies and incidence angles if a broader ionospheric height range is to be sampled effectively."
"A coordinate system is defined with respect to a magnetic dipole field configuration by unit vectors in the direction of the field, in the azimuthal direction, and along the line of intersection of the local magnetic meridian plane with the local equipotential surface of the magnetic dipole. The velocity terms of the continuity and momentum equations pertinent to plasma motion are expressed in terms of variations along these coordinate directions."
"By using full-wave theory, an analysis is made of the radiation resistance of a short filamentary electric dipole, oriented with an arbitrary angle with respect to the static magnetic field, in a cold, uniform magnetoplasma. The frequency range considered lies below the local lower hybrid resonance frequency and above the proton gyrofrequency, and in this range approximate closed-form expressions for the radiation resistance are obtained by using a plasma model appropriate to the magnetosphere. These closed-form expressions are valid for dipoles of moderately restricted length, and the physical implications of this length restriction are discussed. It is found that the radiation resistance R increases rapidly as ϕ0, the angle of dipole orientation with respect to the magnetic field, varies from 0° to 30° but only gradually as ϕ0 varies from 30° up to 90°. The ratio of R(ϕ0 = 90°)/R(ϕ0 = 0°) is approximately equal to (fHe/f)2. Except for the case of parallel orientation and f < 10−2 fHe, the radiation resistance of an electric dipole in the magnetoplasma is ∼ 102 to 105 times larger than that in free space. Thus, for the low frequency range considered, an electric dipole in the magnetoplasma is generally much more efficient that it would be in free space."
"This paper describes experiments designed to measure the radiation patterns of a longitudinal wave excited in a warm plasma by both monopole and dipole antennas. The longitudinal wave used in this experiment is the low-frequency ion acoustic wave that propagates with a phase velocity [γkTe/Mi]1/2. Experimental results agree well with the theoretical predicted radiation pattern."
"The method of approximate product integration is applied to solve numerically the integral equations of the total currents on the surfaces of the finite tubular cylinder with complete generality both in radius and length. Procedures have been devised to take care of the square-root singularity of the transverse total current at the end of the cylinder. Both total currents and scattering cross sections are presented for three special cases with ka = 1.0 and kh = 0.5π, 1.0π, and 1.5π. A complete set of the computer program in Fortran 4 has been prepared for the IBM 7094 at Harvard Computing Center. It can solve simultaneously for cylinders of the same radius but discrete and different lengths."
"We study the variations of the refractive index of a moving homogeneous dispersive halfspace (cold plasma or conventional dielectric) under the incidence of a plane quasi-monochromatic wave entering from vacuum. The medium is moving parallel or perpendicular to the boundary, and the plane of incidence, containing either the magnetic or the electric vector, has an arbitrary azimuthal orientation with respect to the velocity of parallel motion."
"The full adiabatic theory is used to describe wave propagation in a warm magnetoplasma for frequencies around the plasma frequency and the upper hybrid resonance frequency. By comparison with the microscopic theory for directions perpendicular and parallel to the static magnetic field, we can well define the range of validity of the full adiabatic theory, which can then be used for computation of the group velocity. The variation of this group velocity as a function of frequency for several directions of propagation is shown for models corresponding to the ionosphere and the far magnetosphere. Three factors deserve attention: (1) the upper hybrid resonance and its neighborhood can be rigorously studied for far magnetospheric conditions by using the full adiabatic theory; (2) the computed modes present a mixed electrostatic-electromagnetic character; (3) The minima in group velocities for pseudoresonance frequencies progressively fill up as the temperature increases."

"This paper reviews current knowledge of the diurnal variation and spatial distribution of total electron content in the equatorial ionosphere. The problems of data reduction peculiar to stations near the equator are considered. There is a large diurnal variation up to 40:1 that is greatest at the equinoxes and least in local winter. An ‘equatorial anomaly’ in total electron content similar to the anomaly observed in f0F2 exists and is largely associated with the topside. Considerable differences in detail, particularly with regard to the time of disappearance of the anomaly, occur at different longitudes. Peaks of ionization have been observed around 2300 LT at about 26° of magnetic dip. Although little correlation has been found with magnetic activity on individual days, collective data indicate a reduction in the depth of the equatorial trough with magnetic disturbances, with the maxima occurring closer to the dip equator. More detailed work is indicated on the effects of longitude and magnetic activity, on the nighttime content, and on large-scale irregularities."
"The continuity equation of ionization and the equation of motion of the neutral atmosphere are solved simultaneously in the ionospheric F2 region for different seasons in different epochs of solar activity. The model atmosphere used is that given by L. G. Jacchia (1965). Epstein functions are used to simulate the electron and ion temperature profiles. An ionization production function in a Jacchia model atmosphere is derived and used. The computed wind velocity and f0F2 behavior are presented and compared with other theoretical results as well as the existing experimental data. The meridional wind is found to agree reasonably well with the incoherent scatter data. It is found that the declination effect resulting from neutral winds can be used to explain certain experimental observations in a semi-quantitative manner."
"The total electron content of the ionosphere often responds in a dramatic way to increases in geomagnetic activity. By monitoring the VHF signals from the geostationary satellite ATS 3, it has been possible to study in detail the very pronounced increases in total content often found during the afternoon hours on the day of the commencement of a magnetic storm. Comparisons with magnetic field data show that the enhancements in electron content coincide with increases in the total magnetic field. This simultaneity suggests that, when the magnetosphere is compressed during the initial phase of a storm, the ionization stored in the magnetic tubes of force may be dumped into the topside of the F region. Such a depletion of the protonosphere is in agreement with whistler measurements, which indicate that a contraction of the plasmasphere occurs during periods of increased magnetic activity."
"Studies of total electron content (TEC) have been made by using data obtained during three winter solstices in Paris, France, and Kiruna, Sweden. A nocturnal winter maximum is clearly shown by these data, and an effort is made to hypothesize its cause. A two-fold hypothesis is offered; the increase in TEC is attributed to an electron flux descending from the protonosphere. This flux is linked to lowering electron temperatures in the force tube after sunset in the conjugate hemisphere. In addition to this production process, a regulatory process is invoked to reconcile the observed values with the maximum flux intensity compatible with the theory. The regulatory process is attributed to an interaction between the neutral winds and the ionospheric plasma in the presence of the earth's magnetic field."
"Records of Faraday rotation of signals from radio beacon satellites during traveling ionospheric disturbances are simulated for spaced stations. These synthetic records are used to discuss, first, observational differences using geostationary satellites and low-orbiting satellites and, secondly, the effect of assuming a height value for the disturbance in the analysis of the low-orbiting satellite data."
"Through the use of the data obtained from the BE-B satellite, the effect of the solar cycle and the seasonal variation of the total electron content of the ionosphere are separated and evaluated. The results are compared with those of other authors."
"An experiment has been proposed, for the early 1970's, for the purpose of obtaining data on ionospheric and tropospheric effects on wide-band trans-atmospheric transmission. It is desired to radiate three combs (each composed of seven to ten highly stable, phase-coherent CW signals) from a geostationary satellite and to monitor the amplitude and phase of the signals in considerable detail. The tones would be grouped at S band, L band, and UHF, with group bandwidths and frequency spacings set to measure the mean dispersion and second-order parameters of the random part of the channel. One CW signal would be transmitted at HF and one at VHF to provide a comparative link with the existing collection of scintillation data obtained by various workers. Some multiple-antenna observations are desired so that spatial coherence questions can also be attacked. It is hoped that observations will be made through the equatorial, midlatitude, and auroral ionosphere."
"A new-style beacon experiment for measuring the difference-differential-Doppler (DDD) effect and the Faraday effect by using signals from geostationary satellites is proposed. By using the beacon frequencies of a geostationary satellite with frequency ranges >130 MHz, it can be shown that above 5000 km the upper atmosphere does not contribute measurably to the Faraday rotation angle. This is due to the weighting function of the earth's magnetic field and the decrease in electron content with increasing altitude. The so-called differential Doppler is not affected by the above-mentioned weighting function, and therefore ∫Nds is measurable along the total range up to 36,000 km, which is the distance of the geostationary satellite. In general, the Faraday rotation and the differential Doppler only display the variation of ∫Nds as a function of time; e.g., the total amount of ∫Nds is not known. By measuring the Faraday rotation on two closely spaced frequencies, however, one can calculate the total amount of ∫Nds up to about 5000 km. This experiment was designed so that the DDD effect and the Faraday effect could be measured on two closely spaced frequencies. To measure the total electron content (TEC) up to 36,000 km, the following new method (DDD) is proposed; Over a time interval of approximately 4 minutes, the beacon frequency of 138 MHz is slowly shifted to 137.5 MHz and then slowly back to 138 MHz; simultaneously, the frequency 414 MHz is shifted to 412.5 MHz and back to 414 MHz. By designing an appropriate phase-locked receiving system, it seems possible to measure the so-called difference-differential Doppler with an accuracy of better than 5%, e.g., to calculate the total amount of ∫Nds from 0 to 36,000 km. No other known method can achieve such an accuracy. The effective radiated power of the satellite antenna never exceeds 1 watt. Taking into account navigation systems, ∫Nds represents, apart from a constant well-known factor, the total range error that is due to the ionosphere and magnetosphere. Measurements of the Faraday effect and differential-Doppler effect (137.350 and 412.050 MHz) with signals from the ATS-3 satellite displayed very sensitively traveling ionospheric disturbances (TID) at our observing station in Lindau. By using several reasonably located observing stations, dynamic processes (TID) in the upper atmosphere might be easily investigated. Regardless of whether it will be possible to determine accurately the exospheric electron content and whether this proposal will be accepted, there is an absolute necessity for any measuring method that yields ∫Nds with a much higher accuracy than can be determined by the presently used methods. The determination of ∫Nds is required with at least the above-mentioned accuracy for any thorough investigation of so-called occultation experiments. Comparisons with other methods in use for calculating ∫Nds are presented, e.g., regular group-delay measurements. The proposed method seems to yield the most accurate measurements possible for these particular experiments. It is very likely that from a technical point of view the accuracy is greater than can be obtained with the group-delay methods now used. From a theoretical point of view, however, the degrees of accuracy obtained by the two methods are comparable."
"Simultaneous observations of propagation paths to two synchronous satellites transmitting at 137 MHz have revealed distinctive characteristics of the equatorial irregularity structure. Data were taken between July 1967 and February 1969. The abrupt onset of scintillations on a particular path within minutes led to the concept that a sharp boundary of about 10 km exists between quiet non-scintillating regions and regions of irregularities. Once the scintillation has started, a region over 5000 km wide from east to west may contain irregularities. Within such a region there is strong localized control of irregularities. Comparison of scintillation onset on two paths spaced 1 to 2 hours apart at their subionospheric points reveals that, in the mean, scintillation onset is a function of local time. However, many days show nearly simultaneous onset on two paths that are 1 hour apart in local time. Other days show onset of scintillations on the westerly satellite path before onset at the eastern intersection; this variability is clearly a negation of the diurnal pattern. Maximum occurrence of scintillation has been observed in September, October, and November. A somewhat lower occurrence of high-amplitude scintillation is noted in the December-January solstice period. A secondary maximum exists in March, according to other South American data. A very low occurrence of scintillation is observed in May, June, and July. The scintillation phenomenon is correlated in the mean with the downward motion of the F layer after 2100 local time at Huancayo. A hypothesis is advanced that after 2100 the westerly F-layer maximum is higher in altitude and has a greater electron density than the easterly maximum. This west-east gradient of electron density produces (either through electrodynamic forces or diffusion) the irregularities that show an apparent eastward drift. The diurnal pattern, with its nighttime maximum of scintillation occurrence, is a westward motion, but the irregularity drifts noted are clearly eastward in the direction of lower electron density profiles."
"The characteristics of F-region irregularities at low latitudes have been studied from scintillations of signals from beacon satellites having different orbital inclinations. It has been found that the irregularities are embedded in distinct N-S-oriented clouds. A comparison of the experimental and theoretical results of scintillation has been made to determine the parameters of the irregularities."
"Tests using satellite signals at 136 MHz have been conducted at NASA STADAN (Satellite Tracking and Data Acquisition Network) in Santiago, Chile, and the spatial correlation coefficient for an equatorial ionospheric disturbance has been computed. Test data were obtained on telemetry antennas separated from east to west by 1168 feet. The polarization correlation of the signal (horizontal and vertical) at one antenna is shown to be high (0.68). The correlation for the 1168-foot spacing is shown to be low (0.2). Other data from Minitrack interferometer measurements are also included."
"Scintillation observations at 136 MHz were made with the Canary Bird synchronous satellite during the winter of 1967–1968 and the spring and early summer of 1968. The diurnal pattern of scintillations is similar for the two periods. The mean scintillation index is higher during the spring and early summer, however, because of the increase in the percentage of occurrence of mild scintillations during this period. There is a positive correlation between nighttime scintillations and magnetic activity. On the other hand, daytime scintillations are only slightly dependent on magnetic activity."
"Simultaneous observation of minute-by-minute ionograms and signal-amplitude recordings from Explorer 22 (BE-B) have shown a marked coincidence of high scintillation indices and a height spreading of the sporadic-E trace. These observations, made at Athens (37°58'N, 23°43'E) over a period of 18 months, lead to the conclusion that the existence of spreading is usually associated with strong scintillation."
"A study of multi-station scintillation observations of the 137-MHz transmissions from ATS-3 during the magnetic storm of October 30 to November 4, 1968, was made to separate the diurnal pattern of high-latitude irregularities from storm-time effects. The night maximum was maintained during magnetic storms, but the pattern was modulated by storm-time effects. Daytime scintillation indices were increased at specific times during the magnetic storm; a universal time correlation was observed for stations in Europe and in North America. Peak scintillation activity shifted from before midnight (under quiet magnetic conditions) to the 0130 to 0430 time period. A sharp boundary of less than 2° was noted between scintillating and non-scintillating regions. 40-MHz transmissions from Explorer 22 during one period of the storm verified that the irregularity structure extended from 48° to 50° GN to auroral latitudes. Using records of 54-MHz transmissions from Transit 4A taken between 1962 and 1965, as well as the ATS-3 data, it was found that during magnetic storms the lower edge of the scintillation boundary, which bounds the irregularity structure, moves below its quiet positions to lower latitudes, particularly in the midnight-to-dawn time period. It was found that the observations were more adequately ordered by invariant latitudes than geomagnetic (dipole) latitudes used in scintillation papers. Latitude variations in position of the boundary are compared with the trough. It is found that the irregularity-boundary changes as a function of K index and as a function of local time. Latitude variations in the position of the boundary are compared with the trough. Akasofu's concept of nearly open field lines in the plasmapause during magnetic storms might account for the increased scintillation indices as well as for the lower position of the scintillation boundary during magnetic storms."
"The scintillation of radio signals from an artificial earth satellite has been analyzed by spaced receiver techniques to obtain the heights of the electron density irregularities responsible for scintillations observed at the ground. We report such data taken near the maximum of the present solar cycle. These results are also compared with results of data taken near the minimum phase of the solar cycle. Eighty-four passes of BE-B extending from January 1968 to July 1968 were reduced for height values. The heights were computed by measuring the time delays in the ground pattern by graphical cross-correlation techniques. These delays were then substituted into a height equation for a spherical earth and ionosphere. The spherical formula was developed so that height values for sub-ionospheric latitude from 36° to 50°N could be measured. The diurnal behavior and the latitude dependence of irregularity height are studied and compared with results obtained during the solar minimum."
"The heights of ionospheric irregularities were measured at the Sagamore Hill Radio Observatory, 42.6°N, 70.8°W. Beacon signals at 40.01 MHz from Explorer 22 were recorded at spaced receivers during the summer and fall of 1968 and during a short period in the winter of 1969. By using the mean time differences between 1-second samples at each receiver and by using the method of similar fades, the heights of dominant irregularities were found to vary between 130 and 900 km. Scale size (determined from the height measurement and the time between major peaks of the diffraction patterns) increased from 1 km at a height of 200 km to 4 km at a height of 800 km. Two large geomagnetic storms occurred during the test periods. Results were compared with simultaneous measurements of total electron content. The mean height of the irregularity region decreased by 100 km during periods of major depression of total electron content; this decrease suggests that the irregularities are distributed throughout the F region for both quiet and disturbed conditions."
"With the sun as a source, scintillations at four microwave frequencies were observed for 1 year. Scintillation was a daily occurrence at sunrise at elevation angles from 1.5° to 7°. This observation indicates the continued presence of point sources on the sun during the peak of the sunspot cycle. It also suggests that the peculiar terrain configuration along the propagation path is conducive to the production of irregularities in the troposphere. Scintillation data can provide information about the troposphere and about the spectrum of the slowly varying component of solar emission."
"The OV4-1 (orbiting vehicle 4, experiment 1) dual satellite guided ionospheric propagation experiment has confirmed the existence of long-range, low-loss, earth-detached propagation paths in the bottomside ionosphere with mean path losses smaller than equivalent multihop and, in some instances, smaller than free-space propagation. Satellite-to-satellite signals at 34.3 MHz were received from 56 to 100% of the five-minute samples taken in real time by the ground telemetry network while the orbits of the two satellites were decaying from 300 to 250 km. Measured values of path losses range from between 124 and 159 db. Multipath spread was never found larger than 550 / μsec, and there is some evidence that Doppler spread was less than 0.012 Hz. Signals at 20.75 and 46.8 MHz in the satellite-to-satellite link were rarely received beyond the line of sight."
"ORBIS CAL is the mnemonic for Orbiting Radio Beacon Ionospheric Satellite for Calibration, which is an experiment in ionospheric ducting of satellite beacon signals that was performed March 19–24, 1969. Propagation ranges of 20,000 kilometers were recorded frequently at day and night hours at Thule and at Sagamore Hill, Massachusetts. The results of this experiment are compared with those of earlier ORBIS attempts, and the probable propagation mechanisms are discussed. Rough path-loss calculations indicate that received levels exceed those of free-space propagation by about 5 decibels."

"Photographs from the Ranger probes provided the first direct evidence on the fine-scale topography of the moon and showed that the surface is relatively smooth over slope distances of 1 meter. In addition to craters, elements contributing to the topography at this scale are the closely spaced ridges and troughs of lunar patterned ground. Blocks in the size range 0.5 meters to several meters were not seen in the Ranger pictures, perhaps because of the limited sampling at three widely separated points. Ranger 7 photographs showed the preponderance of shallow elongate to circular craters along rays. Ranger 8 photographs were notable for portraying with new clarity the craters Sabine and Ritter, which appear to be of internal rather than impact origin. Ranger 9 photographs of the floor of the crater Alphonsus contained data from which a complicated geologic history of the floor can be deciphered."
"The new data on the physical characteristics of the lunar surface derived from the Surveyor pictures can be fitted to a simple ballistic model for the origin and development of the lunar regolith. At a given locality, the size-frequency distributions of craters on the lunar surface can be represented by two functions: Small craters follow a steady-state distribution of the form F = Φcμ, where F is the cumulative number of craters with a diameter ≥c, c is the diameter of the craters, Φ and μ have the steady-state values Φ = 1010-9, and μ = —2.00 at all five Surveyor landing sites. Larger craters are represented by the function F = χcλ, where λ < μ, and χ varies from one landing site to another. The solution for c at the intersection of F = χcλ with F = Φcμ, designated as c„ is the upper limiting crater diameter for the steady-state distribution. The value of c, is a function of the age of the surface on which the regolith has formed. The thickness of the lunar regolith may be estimated from a variety of observational data. The estimated thickness of the regolith at a given Surveyor landing site is bracketed by the original depths of (1) the smallest blocky-rimmed craters that cut through the regolith and excavate coherent material beneath, and (2) the largest, sharp, raised-rim craters without blocks that have been excavated wholly within the slightly cohesive material that forms the regolith. Other direct estimates of the thickness of the regolith are the inferred original depth of the largest craters believed to have been formed by drainage of the regolith material into subregolith fissures and, at the Surveyor-7 site, the depth at which the surface sampler instrument encountered coherent material. The thickest regolith was found at the Surveyor-6 site, where it is estimated to be more than 10 meters thick, and the thinnest was found at the Surveyor-7 site, where it is estimated to be 2 to 15 cm thick. Particle counts from sample areas at each of the Surveyor landing sites show an approximately linear relationship between the log of the cumulative particle counts and the log of the particle size. A power function of the form N = KDλ (where N is the cumulative number of particles with diameter equal to or larger than D, and D is the diameter of particles) can be fitted to the data at each site. The size-frequency distribution of resolvable fragments at the Surveyor 3, 5, and 6 landing sites was found to be the same, within errors of estimation, but at the Surveyor 1 and 7 sites coarse fragments are more numerous. Considering all five sites, we found a strong inverse correlation between the abundance of coarse blocks and the thickness of the regolith. The coarsest fragments are most abundant at the sites with the thinnest regolith."
"Photometric and polarimetric properties of lunar soil and rock fragments were determined from Surveyor pictures. High resolution measurements (centimeter scale) revealed differences in the photometric functions of various materials concomitant with probable different fine-scale surface textures. The photometric function of the light, undisturbed fine-grained lunar soil is similar to the function measured through an earth-based telescope (kilometer resolution), whereas the darker, disturbed soil has a more peaked backscatter function, and smooth compressed soil has more Lambertian-like reflectivity. Most rock fragments seem to have essentially dust-free surfaces and a Lambertian-like photometric function; their normal albedos are estimated to range from 9 to 22%. The polarimetric function of lunar soil is similar to that of basalt and gabbro powdered to a grain size of 30 to 75 μ. Lunar rocks reflecting strongly polarized-light (up to 34% polarized) have the highest albedos. The observed polarimetric function of lunar rocks is more similar to that of basalt and gabbro than any other common rock type."
"Lunar surface mechanical properties have been interpreted from the interactions of five Surveyor spacecraft with the lunar surface (exclusive of the surface sampler). The lunar soil at the one highland and the four lunar mare landing sites is remarkably similar, even though these sites are widely separated. The soil is predominantly fine-grained and granular; it is estimated to have a cohesion value between 0.05 and 0.17 N/cm2. The static bearing strength of the soil increases with depth. It is estimated that, at the surface, the strength is less than 0.1 N/cm2; at a depth of 4 cm, for a 25-cm-diameter plate, the strength is somewhat greater than the originally estimated 4 to 6 N/cm2. The soil, at least in the upper few centimeters, is compressible."
"Chemical analyses of lunar surface materials were obtained in situ by Surveyors 5, 6, and 7. Mare samples were analyzed by Surveyors 5 and 6, which landed in Mare Tranquillitatis and Sinus Medii, respectively [Turkevich et al., 1967b, 1968]. The Surveyor-7 analyses were made in a terra region near the crater Tycho, which is thought to be covered with ejecta from that crater [Patterson et al., 1969]. The two adjacent samples in Mare Tranquillitatis were at least partially covered with material thrown out by the footpads of the spacecraft as it slid down the side of a small crater. The sample in Sinus Medii consisted of apparently undisturbed surface material, as did also the first Tycho sample. The second Tycho sample was a small rock on the surface, in contrast with the other five lunar samples, which consisted mainly of finely divided material. The third sample at the Tycho site was made up, at least partially, of subsurface material exposed by the soil mechanics surface sampler."
"The seven unmanned spacecraft that have landed on the moon, together with the lunar orbiting spacecraft, provided considerable information on the chemical composition, mechanical properties, and small-scale structure of the lunar surface. This abstract, prepared prior to manned landing on the moon, summarizes some of the results; a more complete account is available elsewhere [Jaffe, 1969a, c]. Spacecraft results pertaining to the lunar interior and to the surroundings of the moon are omitted from this paper, as are results based on data from electromagnetic detectors alone, which other papers at this symposium discuss and interpret."
"The results of the remote probing of the moon by means of infrared and microwave emissions and by radar are reviewed. Also, we discuss how the various observational results can help to explain physical parameters of the lunar surface, such as thermal and electrical conductivities, dielectric constant, density, particle sizes in the lunar regolith, depth of the surface layer, roughness of the surface, variation of these parameters from point to point on the surface, and amount of heat generated in the lunar interior."
"Measurements of infrared (IR) radiation from the moon are used to estimate the thermophysical properties of the lunar soil and to infer the general nature of small-scale surface relief. Directional emission characteristics of the illuminated surface are probably associated with small craters of recent origin. On the other hand, abnormal populations of exposed rocks are thought to be responsible for many of the localized thermal enhancements observed during an eclipse. Implications of infrared measurements regarding the evolution of the surface are described."
"Mid-infrared spectra (7.0 to 13.5 μ) of six different areas on the lunar surface have been obtained from an altitude of 31 km by using a 24-inch balloon-borne telescope. All spectra show significant departures from blackbody or graybody emission, in particular displaying a peak in emissivity that varies in wavelength from 8.11 to 8.37 μ. The position of this peak varies regularly with type of surface feature in the field of view. Laboratory studies show that the wavelength of peak emissivity in surface emission can be interpreted in terms of rock composition, and that the differences in peak emissivity from place to place result from differences in rock type. Barring some unanticipated systematic error, the data obtained so far indicate that the two circular maria, Imbrium and Serenitatis, are ultrabasic in composition, whereas the lunar crust appears to be basic in composition. This compositional heterogeneity may explain location of major mascons in the circular maria."
"It is of great interest to compare the results of the chemical analysis of the lunar surface material made by ‘Surveyor’ with that based on the data of the radio astronomical investigations of the electromagnetic properties of the lunar material. The method of determining the chemical composition by the equipment brought onto the moon by Surveyor 7 has been described by Turkevich et al. [1968]."
"Polarized and depolarized radar maps of' the moon have been obtained at the Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory at a wavelength of 70 cm. These maps show strong positive anomalies, many of which are associated with young craters. These anomalies and the average diffuse component of radar echoes are attributed to the scattering behavior of surface and subsurface rocks. We have been able to approximately match the observed spatial and wavelength variation of the diffuse component, as well as the absolute value of its cross section, with theoretical calculations that use a Mie scattering description of the single scattering behavior of the rocks, and to employ the Surveyor spacecraft's determination of the size distribution of surface rocks. Furthermore, we have found that surface rocks appear capable of accounting for temperature anomalies (IR hot spots) which are associated with these craters."
"Bistatic radar observations of the lunar surface conducted with Explorer 35 at 2.2 meters have been used to measure the average large-scale (tens to hundreds of meters) lunar slopes. Data obtained for the equatorial band between 70° east and west longitude show significant (3:1) regional variations. Unidirectional rms slopes of 2°, 3°, and 6° were obtained for Mare Fecunditatis and Oceanus Procellarum, the central highlands and terra surrounding the crater Alfraganus, and the Censorinus highlands, respectively. A comparison of the slope variations and visible surface structure suggests that the meter wavelength radar slopes are those of the visible surface measured on the set of scales given above."
"A model based on first principles and laboratory results is presented for describing and evaluating long term effects of meteoritic impact against the lunar surface. The evolution of the cratered surface and concomitant regolith is calculated and compared with observations and analyses of Lunar Orbiter photographs. It is indicated that most craters are of impact origin, but gross differences in the apparent ages of surfaces in various units and regions of the moon imply that endogenic processes also must have been active, probably since the beginning of Precambrian time and, perhaps, as recently as a few million years ago."
"The unusual optical properties of the moon are summarized. They imply that the fine-grained, compressible material observed by the Surveyor television cameras is representative of the entire lunar surface and very probably of the surfaces of Mercury, Mars, and the asteroids also. The soil is the result of repeated meteorite impacts and is not an ash flow. Evidence for darkening is examined, and it is concluded that a process is acting on the lunar surface to alter the albedo and color of the rock powder. Materials of chondritic or granitic composition are not prevalent on the moon. Differences in the optical properties of the maria and the highlands imply that the soil cover is thicker in the highlands than in the maria and that the highland soils are laterally more homogeneous than are those of the maria."
"A quantitative estimate of the gravity features on the near surface of the moon has been obtained by iteratively constructing a mass density model to improve the agreement between actual Doppler tracking data from Lunar-Orbiter spacecraft and theoretical trajectory predictions. Thirty three typical orbits (24 nearly polar and 9 nearly equatorial) were selected at 3 to 4 degree separations to cover most of the front side of the moon. Each iterative stage consisted of placing masses near the lunar surface at locations indicated by the peak residual accelerations observed after fitting the data with the model constructed at the previous iteration."
"The origin of the mascons is explained in terms of a primordial atmosphere and hydrosphere of the moon lasting of the order of 1 b.y. from the origin 4.5 b.y. ago. On this basis, the mascons arose in four steps: (1) excavation of a large crater by meteoritic impact at a time close to the moon's origin, (2) subsequent isostatic adjustment of its rim and true door, (3) rigidification of the crater and extensive depositon of sediments in its interior while an atmosphere and hydrosphere existed, and (4) eventual dessication of the sediments in the floor when the atmosphere and hydrosphere vanished. Rigidification of the crater (within a time about 1 m.y. after the moon's origin) prior to the main deposition of the sediments implies that the mascon load is supported by the strength of the underlying rock to produce a positive gravitational anomaly (independently of sediment density). The same history of the hydrosphere explains the presence of negative mascons in the irregular maria as a consequence of low sedimentation in these areas. The thicknesses of the mascons (at the apex, for a conical shape) in the prominent circular maria are obtained by scaling from the computer results of Conel and Holstrom for a sediment density (2.4 g/cm3) corresponding to shale. By means of Haskell's equation, it is shown that the lunar craters exclusive of those forming mascon basins cannot be compensated isostatically. It follows that the curves of Baldwin and of Gilvarry for the diameter-depth and diameter-rim relations for lunar craters can be extrapolated to infer the uncompensated depths and uncompensated rim heights of the primordial mascon craters. Available measurements of these parameters for the present time permit evaluation of isostatic adjustments in dimensions of mascon craters. On the basis of these data, a plot of the change in rim volume corresponding to isostatic subsidence of the crater rim against the volume corresponding to isostatic elevation of the cratic floor yields equality over two powers of 10 in the variables, within the accuracy of the data. This quantitative check tends to confirm strongly the isostasy of the true floors of the mascon craters and the support by the mantle rock of the mascon loads, as postulated in the theory."
"Spacecraft measurements have revealed a hot, dense, CO2 atmosphere on Venus and a cold, thin, CO2 atmosphere on Mars. The surface pressure on Mars varies markedly with topographic elevation and probably with latitude and season. The lowest regions of the atmosphere of Venus have yet to be probed. Several thin microwave-absorbing cloud decks, perhaps consisting of water droplets or compounds of mercury, exist in the atmosphere of Venus. It may be possible to explain the ionospheres of Mars and Venus in terms of the photochemistry of CO2 and lighter trace elements plus the effects of the impinging solar wind."
"The automatic interplanetary stations Venera 5 and Venera 6 reached Venus on May 16 and 17, respectively, and made measurements of the night-side atmosphere in the equatorial plane at a distance of 2700 km from the dawn terminator. The most probable distance between the points where the stations entered the atmosphere was about 300 km. The detailed description of the probe design may be found in Pravda [1969]."
"The fact that Venus has an atmosphere was discovered by M. V. Lomonosov in 1761. However, attempts to investigate its properties during the following two centuries were not sufficiently successful for construction of an adequate model. This situation has only recently been changed. The successful flights of the Soviet automatic interplanetary stations Venera 4, 5, and 6, the flight of the American space probe Mariner 5, and recent radio astronomical and radar investigations of Venus provide a great deal of important new information about this planet. The present report is a survey of modem data on the atmosphere of Venus."
"Radio interferometry measurements have been made of the temperature variation over Venus. The results imply that the temperature has no significant poleward variation. A limit of 12°K can be placed on the surface temperature difference between poles and equator. A small phase-dependent asymmetry was measured, corresponding to an 18.4 ± 9.2°K maximum brightness difference between the equatorial limbs. This maximum difference occurs near inferior conjunction. The data also indicate that the disk of Venus is limb brightened. The extent of the brightening can be fitted if Venus' atmosphere is composed of 95% CO2, with no water, and has an extensive isothermal layer at the surface."
"The determination of the opacity law as a function of wavelength for the Venus atmosphere is discussed. Interferometric and integrated brightness temperature observations are compared to model calculations for atmospheres of CO2, N2, and H2O which are consistent with the radar opacity law. If the atmosphere of Venus is essentially pure COs, a surface pressure of 78 atm with a surface temperature of 725°K is obtained. The total COs in the atmosphere of Venus is estimated to be 4 × 1023 grams, which is in fair agreement with the amount of CO2 that has escaped from the interior of the earth since its formation."
"A geochemical study of the interactions of the atmosphere and lithosphere of Venus predicts that a substantial mass of electrically conducting clouds may be present on the planet. Furthermore, the existence of a substantial abundance of gases capable of strong microwave absorption also seems probable. The possible effects of these phenomena on the microwave properties of the atmosphere are discussed in a qualitative manner, and it is concluded that, although models with surface pressures ranging from perhaps 30 to 140 bars may be reconciled with the radar data, models near the lower end of this range are more appealing from the standpoint of atmospheric chemistry and geochemical thermodynamics."
"The analysis of the Mariner-5 radio occultation data has resulted in significant new information on the structure of cloud layers in the lower atmosphere of Venus. Figure 1 shows the Mariner-5 signal attenuation as a function of altitude recorded during the occultation experiment. The solid line marked ‘CO2 defocusing’ shows the anticipated attenuation calculated with the assumption that the atmosphere is mainly composed of CO2 and that the atmospheric defocusing is the only cause of attenuation. The observational curve in the figure differs from the calculated curve in two respects: (1) the observed attenuation is considerably greater than that anticipated at altitudes below 52 km; and (2) although the theoretical curve is smooth, the measured attenuation shows a structure with sharp changes in slope and several peaks."
"A study of the thermal conditions in the lower atmosphere of Venus has been made based on the measurements obtained by the space probes Venera 4, Venera 5, and Venera 6 [Avduevsky et al., 1969a, b; Pravda, 1969]. Following the results reported earlier [Avduevsky et al., 1968], we constructed models of the radiative and convective heat transfer. Calculations of the outgoing radiative fluxes were made for selected bands at wave numbers ranging from 500 to 7700 cm−1; to allow for the angular distribution of the radiation field, different assumptions for the percentage of water vapor and the optical properties of the clouds were adopted. This plane-stratified model depends on the assumption that the atmosphere is transparent to the short-wave end of the solar radiation spectrum. The available values of CO2 and H2O absorption coefficients versus temperature have been used. The results of these calculations lead us to conclude that if the atmosphere consists of CO2 and does not contain water vapor, the upward radiative heat transfer from the surface considerably exceeds the radiative flux falling on the upper boundary of the clouds."
"As the radio signal of Mariner 6 was intercepted by the surface of Mars near Meridiani Sinus, the presence of an atmosphere caused small changes in the frequency of the received signal. Analysis of these changes indicates that the pressure at the surface of Mars at that point is about 6.6 mb and the temperature approximately 276°K. Data taken as the radio beam emerged from behind Mars in the vicinity of the north pole indicate a surface pressure of approximately 6.4 mb and a temperature of about 158°K. Extrapolation of the 6.6-mb pressure measurement at the point of entry over the 12-km range of topological variation measured by earth-based radars indicates that the surface pressure in the near north equatorial regions of Mars may vary from about 3 to about 8 mb."
"Data from the Mariner 1969 radio occultation measurements are utilized to derive altitude profiles for the refractivity, the free electron number density, and the plasma temperature above the occultation points. Initial results indicate that the ionosphere was denser and warmer in 1969 than during the quiet solar conditions prevailing at the time of the Mariner 4 encounter with Mars in 1965. The dayside ionosphere consists of two layers with peak densities of the order of 7 × 104 and 1.7 × 105 electrons/cm3 at 110- and 135-km altitude, respectively. Assuming that CO2+ is the principal ion in the main layer yields a topside plasma temperature of 400°–500°K. A marked change in the scale height near 250 km may reflect the transition to a lighter ion such as CO+. No clear signature of nighttime ionosphere was observed."
"Dynamics of the interaction of a magnetized supersonic plasma flow (solar wind) with a planetary ionosphere are examined. The flow behavior across a bow magnetohydrodynamic shock and in the post-shock region, where the flow interacts with the planetary ionosphere, is analyzed. It is argued that the pressure balance between the solar wind and the post-shock plasma is provided mainly by static gas pressure rather than by a large magnetic field ‘build-up.’"
"Recent radio and radar studies of Mercury and Venus conducted since the last Symposium on Planetary Surfaces and Atmospheres are reviewed briefly."
"This paper summarizes the results of 84 measurements of Mercury at 3.75-cm wavelength. These data show that the microwave disk temperature varies with phase angle and with hermographic longitude and that the ratio of the electrical to thermal skin depths in Mercury's epilith is approximately unity at 1-cm wavelength."
"Observations of Mercury at 3.3 mm were made on 35 days in 1967 and 82 days in 1968 to (1) search for a dependence of the disk-average brightness temperature TB on hermocentric longitude and (2) to provide constraints on the range of values of the thermal parameters of the epilith (subsurface layers) of Mercury. The observations can be represented by where the statistical standard errors are indicated, ϕ is the phase angle, and l' is the hermocentric longitude of the subearth point. The estimated over-all system calibration error is 10%. The longitude dependence is demonstrated more clearly when individual phase variation curves are plotted for separate longitude intervals. The ratio of electrical to thermal skin depths (normalized by the wavelength) δ/λ (cm−1) is 1.3 (+1.4, —0.8); the error estimate is very conservative. The observations have been compared with the series of models by Morrison [1969]; of these models, the one with δ/λ = 1.37 and a conductivity independent of temperature best represents the data."
"Radar time-delay and Doppler observations have been used to infer surface-height variations near the equator of Venus. One method, applicable along the apparent equator within a few degrees from the subradar point, has a resolution of about 25 km in longitude and 200 km in latitude and has disclosed an elevated region with a height of about 2 km. Within the latitudinal-resolution cell, the region extends ISO km in longitude and has a radar cross section enhanced by about 4 db above average. A second method employs measurements of the round-trip delay to the subradar point on the target planet. These data, accumulated over a number of years, cover the entire equatorial region on Venus, although nonuniformly. Each observation has a resolution along the surface of about 1000 km. Comparison of the measured values with predictions that assume Venus to be spherically symmetric, but that take into account all other significant effects, shows systematic trends in the residuals as a function of the longitude on Venus of the subradar point. A model in which the equator is assumed to be elliptical (semi-major axis, a; semi-minor axis, b) with center offset by from the center of mass allows the systematic trends to be removed. With all relevant parameters estimated simultaneously, we find Δρ = 1.5 ± 0.3 km and a — b = 1.1 ± 0.4 km (formal standard errors). Topically, the actual uncertainty is several times the formal error. The direction of Δρ, determined with a formal standard error of 10°, points approximately away from the earth at inferior conjunction. The first method has not been applied to Mercury because of its weaker echo signal. The second method, using data that cover the entire equatorial region, yields time-delay residuals which show no systematic trend when displayed as a function of the longitude on Mercury of the subradar point; the estimates for Δρ and a — b are both less than their respective formal standard errors of 0.4 and 0.2 km. Thus, both Venus and Mercury possess surface height variations far smaller in magnitude than those of either the earth or Mars."
"A map of the surface reflectivity of Venus at a wavelength of 3.8 cm is obtained by using a fixed base line radar interferometer. The two-fold hemispheric ambiguity in the range-Doppler map has been resolved by interferometry. The map covers a region extending approximately from —80° to 0° longitude (Carpenter's definition) and from —50° to 40° in latitude. The map shows many new features in addition to delineating clearly features already observed. Large circular regions with a radar appearance similar to lunar maria are among the newly observed features. Analysis of the method employed in resolving the hemispheric ambiguity shows that the relatively small range of projected base line change available produces only small sidelobes in the noise level."
"Delay-Doppler positions of three radar features are given for observations made during the 1964, 1967, and 1969 inferior conjunctions of Venus. The latitude and longitude of each feature were determined from these data by the method of weighted least squares. The results indicate that the rotation period of Venus may be slightly smaller than the earth-synchronous period of 243.16 days. Some preliminary measurements of the polarized and cross-polarized scattering properties of the average surface and the anomalous features are given. These data indicate that the bulk of the surface of Venus is significantly smoother than the moon and that at least two anomalous features give larger ratios of cross-polarized to polarized power than any features known on the moon."
"There is probably no moment in the history of studies of Mars, including the year 1877, in which our knowledge of that planet is changing more rapidly. Prior to 1965 it was generally believed that the surface pressure on Mars was about 85 mb. As a result of ground-based spectroscopy, rocket ultraviolet spectroscopy, and the Mariner 4 flyby mission we now know that the actual pressure is about a factor of ten smaller. Prior to 1966 most students of the subject believed that the topographical relief on Mars was quite minimal. At first on rather inferential grounds and later in a much more direct manner, radar observations have shown that very major elevation differences exist on Mars. In ground-based studies generally, a major assault on Mars is now being performed. On the question of elevation differences, in 1969 two major radar observatories and at least four optical observatories working in the near infrared were attacking the problem with an investment of time hitherto reserved for the most distant objects from earth. At the same time two space vehicles, Mariners 6 and 7, were speeding toward a rendezvous with Mars equipped with a wide range of scientific instruments for remote reconnaissance. Except for the far encounter photographic sequences the spacecraft observed Mars only for a time on the order of an hour, as the space vehicles flew by Mars. However, in 1971 a Mariner mission is scheduled which, if successful, will place two orbiting spacecraft into orbits about Mars with nominal instrumental lifetimes of 90 days. Such a mission should permit complete mapping of the Martian surface at a variety of wavelengths, thorough searches for anomalous features, and systematic investigation of diurnal and seasonal changes on the planet. In 1975 the National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans, in addition to two more orbiters, two landers which will be deposited in selected areas of the planet again with 90 day nominal lifetimes. If all these spacecraft work as intended, it is clear that our knowledge of Mars will have increased by many orders of magnitude in a very few years. For these reasons one could hardly have picked a worse moment to review current knowledge of the surface of Mars. We proceed with this review in full expectation that much of it will be obsolete in the near future."
"During the period surrounding the 1969 opposition, the planet Mars was observed with the Haystack radar to determine the topography in a belt near the equator. Elevation values obtained for the same surface location on Mars on different days of observation agree, for high signal-to-noise ratio cases, to within about 100 meters. Preliminary results show that the variation of surface height with longitude between latitudes 3°N and 12°N is similar to that measured for latitudes near 22°N during the 1967 opposition. The most notable difference is found near 215° longitude, where at 22°N there is a highland at Elysium, although at 5°N a lowland is found. Optically dark regions often have a high radar cross section. However, the topography shows no significant correlation with either the visual or the radar brightness."
"Radar studies of Mars during the 1969 opposition (not yet completed) have yielded preliminary results. Elevation and radar brightness is presented as a function of longitude for areas between 3° and 12° north latitude."
"Radar ranging data taken along the +21.5° parallel of Mars have shown conclusively that elevation differences of up to 11 km occur on the planet. The highest areas observed are desert regions; the maria lie in low areas or on slopes. The canals identified in the radar data all occur in broad and frequently deep valleys which are related to a planet-wide lineament system. It was found that the topographic contours based on the radar data readily fit the visual surface features even in the areas where the features are very complex. The conclusions on the Martian topography were derived from a correlation of the radar data with those Martian surface features that crossed the +21.5° parallel and from an extrapolation of the radar data in the form of a topographic map for the vicinity of this parallel."
"As is known, the study of the moon's thermal radiation provides a rather complete picture of the thermal behavior of its surface and also information on some of its other physical properties [e.g. Troitskii 1967]. The phase variation of the thermal radiation provides most of the information for such an analysis, and the method may also be applied to investigate the surfaces of Venus [Troitskii, 1964] and Mercury [Vetukhnovskaya et al., 1968], For Mars, however, we cannot observe from the earth sufficiently large phase variations. In practice, it is only really possible to observe the more or less completely illuminated side of Mars. Thus, at first, it seems impossible to observe a daily thermal wave from Mars that propagates into the surface and hence to obtain results on the electromagnetic wave damping in the Martian surface, as well as the other conclusions that follow. In fact this is not the case, and here we consider the theory of radio emission from Mars."
"Measurements of the thermal radio emission from all major planets have been reported at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths, and from Jupiter and Saturn at decimeter wavelengths as well. The measured brightness temperatures deduced from these measurements generally exceeds the expected equilibrium temperature calculated from solar heating. The highest temperatures are generally those measured at the longer wavelengths, which are thought to refer to the deeper, presumably hotter layers in the atmosphere. At least for Jupiter and Saturn the high flux measured at infrared wavelengths implies an internal source of heat comparable with solar heating."
"Three parameters of Jupiter's decametric radiation which apparently undergo cyclic variations with periods of the order of a decade are the mean occurrence probability for an apparition, the central meridian longitude of the main source, and the effective width of the main source (or Source A). Observational results indicate that the oscillation in each parameter is caused by the apparent change in Jupiter's aspect as it orbits the sun and that the period in each case is therefore 11.86 yr. It was found that the average rotation period over an 11.86 year interval is 9h 55m 29.73s ± 0.04s. This is probably the rotation period of Jupiter's magnetic field."
"An immersion occultation of Jupiter by the moon on October 19, 1968, UT was recorded at wavelengths of 128 cm (234 MHz) and 74 cm (405 MHz) with the 140-foot radio telescope of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank, West Virginia. One-dimensional brightness distributions are derived from the occultation curves. They show a small asymmetry in the structure of the belts. The results have been combined with observations made at shorter wavelengths to show that there is a significant increase in the angular size of the emission at the longer wavelengths and that the relativistic electron energy spectrum must have a narrow range of energies close to the planet (∼1.5 RJ). The importance of the variation of the magnetic field strength on the radiation emitted from an ensemble of electrons trapped in a dipole field is discussed."
"The total flux density of Jupiter was measured from December 1967 to August 1968 and was found to vary. There is good evidence for a positive correlation with solar activity as measured by the 10.7-cm flux; the most probable phase lag lies between 3 and 9 days."
"New polarimetric observations of Jupiter at 15.4 and 6.65 GHz have been combined with previously published values to determine the microwave spectrum of the planet. All of the data have been normalized to a consistent scale that should be good to 7% on a relative and, hopefully, on an absolute scale. The compound emission has then been separated into its thermal and polarized nonthermal components. The results show that a considerable range of models for the atmosphere of Jupiter will match the spectrum of the thermal component. The most reasonable model probably has an effective temperature near 130°K. The nonthermal synchrotron emission from the Van Allen belts of Jupiter has a peak in its spectrum near 800 MHz and a discontinuity at higher frequencies that suggests two radiation belts surrounding the planet. The polarized fraction of this synchrotron emission reaches a peak of about 30% near a frequency of 3000 MHz but drops on either side of this frequency."
"The two-dimensional distribution of intensity and polarization has been calculated for the synchrotron radiation from electrons trapped in a dipolar magnetic field around a planet. From formulas recently published by Legg and Westfold, the circular polarization is included. The integrated data from these maps are used to suggest models with two thick belts of electrons to account for the decimetric radiation from Jupiter."
"Height-gain measurements conducted previously over a mountain-obstacle diffraction path at 751 MHz are re-evaluated in terms of the calculated lobe patterns."
"Mode conversion of a Gaussian beam due to random fluctuations of a turbulent medium is discussed. The mean-square value of the mode-conversion coefficient (i.e., the power occupation of the higher mode in the perturbed field) is obtained by the perturbation technique. The results show that mode conversion decreases in the neighborhood of the focal point of a focused beam and that the decrease at that point becomes significant when the aperture size is large compared with the scale of the turbulence of the medium. The influence of the anisotropy of the fluctuations on mode conversion is also discussed."
"To determine the approximate temperatures of free electrons in the sunlit ionospheric D region an experiment was conducted at a site near College, Alaska, during the summer and fall of 1960. A dual polarized antenna whose beam was directed at the zenith was used to observe alternately the incident radio noise fluxes in the ordinary and extraordinary polarizations at the frequency 2.89 MHz. The 2.89-MHz radio noise flux measured on a vertical dipole antenna was used to check for propagated interference from low elevation angles. The results show that, during the five-month observing period, the extraordinary-mode antenna registered a median daytime temperature of 260°K, with a standard deviation of about ±23°K, which indicates that the electrons in the D region are approximately in thermal equilibrium with the neutral gas, even at the auroral zones. The theoretically anticipated antenna temperatures, based on assumed ionospheric parameters, agree fairly well with the observed experimental values. In particular, the observed variations of antenna temperature with solar zenith angle can be matched by use of reasonable theoretical models."
"The effects of a total solar eclipse on the equatorial F2 layer are studied by obtaining transient solutions of the time-dependent continuity equation. Electron concentrations for solar minimum conditions are calculated for two meridians that intersect the eclipse path, each at a different latitude. Inter-hemispherical coupling of ionization during an eclipse does not appreciably affect the electron concentrations. After maximum solar obscuration, an upward moving ionospheric layer develops below the F2 peak (on ionograms it appears as a cusp between f0F1 and f0F2 and is known as the eclipse F1.5 layer), and it is explained in this paper in terms of electrodynamic drift. The assumed vertical component of drift is upward and approximately 14 m/sec at noon. The latitudinal extent of the eclipse F1.5 layer is approximately ±10° magnetic latitude. Qualitatively there is good agreement between the calculations and equatorial ionospheric observations. The technique used by ionospheric observers for deducing the daytime electron production rate q and the linear loss coefficient β from eclipse data is applied to the calculated profiles to judge its efficiency in recovering these parameters. At 300 km, q is approximately 100 cm−3 sec−1 and β is approximately 1 × 10−4 sec−1. If a drift of 14 m/sec is ignored, the calculated value of p at 300 km altitude is too large by approximately a factor of 3."
"Calculated parameters of wave propagation illustrate the effects of various choices of ion collision frequencies and molecular weights. Comparisons with atmospheric conductivity measurements tend to justify the use of ion collision frequencies that exceed the collision frequency between neutral particles and of molecular weights that are larger than the molecular weights for the usually assumed atmospheric constituents."
"VLF amplitude data taken at frequencies from 9.2 to 17.2 kHz on two long paths are analyzed in terms of diurnal transmission loss differences. The observed values are in fair accord with theoretical values for the first mode, and the effect of the second mode could account for the observed data scatter in the frequency range of the calculations."
"A Nike-Tomahawk sounding rocket was launched near local noon on November 8, 1966, from Wallops Island with a triaxial electric field experiment using long cylindrical dipoles for sensors. Twenty ELF whistlers with dispersion constants ranging from 0.15 to 0.85 sec1/2 were detected and identified as having propagated up to the rocket through the E region from the earth-ionosphere waveguide. The data extend to the smallest dispersion ever encountered and the lowest frequencies observed on ionospheric whistlers (60 Hz). The waves were eliptically polarized, becoming more nearly circular at higher altitudes. Analysis showed good agreement between the experimental results and quasi-longitudinal (QL) propagation theory for amplitude, dispersion, and polarization characteristics of the wave once it is away from the D- to E-region boundary. No appreciable effects of negative ions or protons were observed in the dispersion of the whistlers."
"Azimuthally directed wave propagation in a concentric cylindrical cavity is considered. The surface impedance of the outer wall is uniform, but there is a discontinuity in the surface impedance for the lower wall. This is a two-dimensional model of propagation of radio waves in the earth-ionosphere waveguide across a land/sea boundary. The dual integral equations for the problem are solved exactly by a Wiener-Hopf procedure. Various limiting forms of the solution are discussed. In particular, it is shown that the exact expression for the mode conversion coefficient is closely related in form to the result obtained by Kirchhoff theory."
"Propagation of radio waves over the surface of a stratified medium with an overburden of arbitrarily varying depth is analyzed in terms of a complete local set of coupled wave amplitudes. The complete set consists of the surface wave and the radiation terms. To reduce the coupling between the component waves, the local modal expansion that is chosen reflects the varying characteristics of the surface wave structure. Comparisons with earlier solutions to somewhat idealized, related problems are given, together with a discussion of recent experimental results."
"An equation that is useful for rapid machine computation of the directivity characteristics of a planar array with discrete identical elements and uniform phase progression is derived. Computer time and cost are reduced by an order of magnitude or more when this equation is used rather than the computational techniques that involve integration of the array power pattern. Parameters of the new equation are the number of elements and the interelement spacings along two principal axes, the beam-pointing angles, the array excitation in amplitude, and an element voltage pattern of the form (cos θ)v+1/2, where v > —1. An example of the usefulness of the equation is given by means of its application to a uniformly excited rectangular array. Curves of directivity versus interelement spacing and scan angle for square arrays with a (cos θ) element power pattern are presented."
"A Green's function G for s2 + k2 is interpreted essentially as a Laplace transform of a Green's function H for s2 — ∂/∂t. The Laplace integral is evaluated by selecting a mixing parameter T and representing H by rays in (0, T) and modes in (T, ∞). This procedure enables one to systematize, simplify, and extend the scope of the technique originated by Ewald (1916). As an illustration, G for a parallel-plate wave guide is detailed."
"It is well known that, for radiating structures supporting scalar spherical modes of index n ≤ N, the maximum obtainable directivity is limited to (N + l)2; the pattern functions for the corresponding arrangement of excitation coefficients are found in closed form. Alternate measures of beam concentration are formulated and optimum pattern functions are computed in closed form. These alternate measures, which are here called beam spread, depend on the entire radiation pattern (weighted by an appropriately chosen weight factor) and are reciprocal to the measures of directivity proposed by Synge (1966). The radiation patterns corresponding to optimizing the classical directivity and beam spread, with respect to a weight function (1 — cos θ), are compared, and it is found that optimizing beam spread yields superior side-lobe structure at the expense of a slight loss in directivity. The extension of these techniques to other weight functions is also explored."
"The scattering of electromagnetic waves from a dense turbulent plasma has been examined experimentally. The experiments include measurements of bistatic radar cross section, Doppler frequency, backscattered cross-polarized signals, and distribution of scattered power by a radar interferometer. Comprehensive diagnostic measurements were made on the plasma so that the radar measurements could be compared to a proposed scattering model. Using the model, the radar cross section of the inhomogeneous plasma can be calculated for peak electron densities well beyond critical. The agreement between calculations and experiments is excellent."
"Radio reflection coefficients for tropospheric elevated layers are examined as functions of the ratio of layer thickness to the effective radio wavelength and the refractive index structure of the layers. The layer reflectivity is shown to be nearly independent of the refractive index structure for small values of the thickness-wavelength ratio. Results for some layers observed with refractometers show that the reflectivities for large thickness-wavelength ratios are generally larger than those given by the simple linear or constant-gradient layer model."
"The effect of resonant and nonresonant gases on the propagation of an arbitrarily modulated pulse is investigated. A general expression is derived for the transient response of the signal; the result is valid even for carrier frequencies near the resonant frequency. For propagation through a nonresonant medium, the expression is exact. The application to tropospheric pulse propagation is briefly discussed, and the effects on a rectangular pulse are shown."
"A method is presented for fitting chi-square (or gamma) distributions to observed distributions, either positively or negatively skewed, of telecommunication variables such as critical frequencies and maximum usable frequencies. These observed distributions have been recorded for years only in terms of the 10, 50, and 90% points, but in applications it is necessary to estimate the entire distribution. It is assumed in the present study that the observed variable can be approximated by a linear function of a chi-square variable with unknown degrees of freedom. The three unknown constants are determined from the three per cent points and a convenient table. Several examples of complete observed distributions are compared graphically with normal, chi-square, Gram-Charlier, and Edgeworth fitted distributions."
"A description is given of a method, based on riometer observations, for the calculation of auroral absorption of HF radio waves propagating over high-latitude paths. Emphasis is on HF radar, but the method is appropriate for use in predicting circuit performance of high-latitude HF communications. The assumptions made and the approximations used are stated explicitly so that, when better information becomes available, explicit corrections can be made. The calculations have been programmed for digital computer and the output for a given set of conditions consists of a map on which are shown contours of median auroral absorption of radio waves returned (by ground backscatter) to the radar site. For the present, only the points on the earth that are reached by one-hop E-layer and/or F-layer propagation are considered."
"A numerical technique is employed in solving the coupled, nonlinear system of equations for the O+, NO+, and O2+ number densities in the nighttime F region, including the effects of diffusion, E×B drift, and neutral air motions. The best fits to the ‘sunset’ [Johnson, 1967] and ‘midnight’ [Holmes et al., 1965] rocket observations of the ion profiles obtained at White Sands, New Mexico, are achieved by iteratively varying the neutral wind, the electrodynamic drift, the neutral atomic nitrogen and nitric oxide concentrations, and the ion-atom interchange and dissociative recombination rate coefficients. The best fit results for both sets of profiles with a Jacchia model atmosphere are achieved with the rate coefficients (cm3 sec−1) at 300°K given by γN2 = 1.1 × 10−12, γO2 = 2.0 × 10−11, αNO+ = 3.5 × 10−7, and αO2+ = 3.1 × 10−7, each with an assumed inverse temperature dependence. In addition, the ‘sunset’ best fit solutions require that the chemical time constant τ for reaction of O2+ with N and NO be 500 seconds at 200 km and that the net vertical plasma transport velocity wz due to E×B drift and a neutral wind be downward with a speed of 14 m sec−1. The midnight best fit solutions are achieved with τ = 2.5 × 103 at 200 km and wz = 10 m sec−1 upward. The 6300-Å nightglow morphology in the inter-tropical region is computed directly from the ion concentrations calculated for assumed drift and neutral wind models representative of equinoctial, sunspot-minimum conditions. Isophote contours of zenith intensity are presented to illustrate the nightglow morphology associated with the decay of the Appleton anomaly. Calculated results are compared with the observations of Barbier [1964] to demonstrate the influence of electrodynamic drift on the morphology of nightglow enhancements. The results show that the electrodynamic drifts required to produce the observed enhancements are consistent with the drifts observed at Jicamarca."
"A procedure for determining ray trajectories in warm magnetoplasmas is presented; it is based on mathematical treatments of the wave dispersion relation. This procedure is used to interpret topside resonance at the upper hybrid frequency as oblique echoes. The following results are obtained: when fT < 2 fH, two Doppler shifted echoes are received after reflection from above the emitting satellite; their frequencies are plotted as functions of time. The absence of such echoes is observed for fT > 2fH."
"The boundary-value problem of multiple scattering by two equal, parallel, but non-overlapping, circular cylinders is considered. Solutions are derived in the form of infinite sums for the scattering intensities and cross sections, but numerical results are presented only for the extinction and back-scattering cross sections, both of which are treated as functions of the separation distance between the two cylinders. Endfire and broadside illumination are distinguished from each other."
"A general formulation is presented for the gain, efficiency, and receiving cross section of antennas in a dissipative (homogeneous and isotropic) medium, and performance limits are established that are generally applicable to reciprocal antennas. The antenna is assumed to be encapsulated in a spherical enclosure immersed in a lossy medium. It is shown that the realized gain is proportional to the product of the directive gain and an efficiency factor, which for lossless antennas is a measure of only the dissipation associated with the near fields. An upper bound on this efficiency is in fact attainable by an elementary magnetic dipole. Since plane waves incident on antennas in dissipative media are frequently inhomogeneous, the definition of the receiving cross section is extended to include such waves. It is shown that for inhomogeneous plane wave incidence the wave received at the antenna terminals is proportional to a far field pattern quantity evaluated in the invisible region. These results are applied to antennas imbedded in a lossy half-space. The limitations on the receiving cross section and realized gain imposed by dissipation in the medium are considered. For a spherical enclosure of a given radius an upper bound is obtained on the receiving cross section. Moreover, this upper bound can be attained by a lossless antenna. Normalized curves of the maximum receiving cross section are plotted for several dissipation factors."
"Suitable engineering expressions for the external impedance per unit length of a long elevated horizontal line source and the mutual impedance between elements of an array of parallel line sources are derived by employing finitely conducting earth image theory techniques. It is shown that the image theory and previously derived analytical results, which are rather complicated, are in excellent agreement."

"The application of the stationary phase method is investigated for a dimensionless line integral encountered in wave propagation. Evaluation of the integral for a first-order point of stationary phase may be expressed, characteristically, by the Fresnel-Kirchhoff function or its derivative. A related function is found for the isolation factor required for finite limits of integration. Curves for evaluating this factor, K(u2 u1), are presented."
"Results of a spaced-receiver experiment using several very low radio frequencies to probe the irregular structure of the lower ionosphere at night are presented. A multiple frequency sounding facility was used whose transmissions were received via a nearly vertically incident first-hop sky wave. The present paper describes some of the statistical characteristics of the phase and amplitude fluctuations in the diffraction pattern at the ground. The data are compared with a theoretical analysis of the diffracting properties of an irregular screen [Bowhill, 1961] to determine the feasibility of using a single receiver near a standard VLF transmitter to continuously monitor the scale size of the irregularities in the nighttime D region by measuring the phase and amplitude of the first-hop sky wave. Some implications are pointed out regarding the functional forms of the spatial spectrum and the correlogram of the irregularities at the height of reflection."
"Computations of nighttime field intensity versus distance are made for a 23.4-kHz signal radiated from Hawaii and for propagation paths to Seattle, Ontario (California), Samoa, and Wake Island. The computations were made by using the waveguide computer program developed at the Naval Electronics Laboratory Center to obtain waveguide mode constants, each 2° of arc or 222 km along each path. An exponential electron-density profile defined by β = 0.5 km-1 and h' = 85.5 was assumed, where β and h' are defined by Wait [1964]. The resultant field was computed by using a WKB approximation to allow for the variation of mode constants along the paths. Experimental measurements of 23.4-kHz signals from NPM were made aboard an airplane as it flew along these propagation paths. (NPM are the call letters for the Lualualei Navy Radio Station in Hawaii.) Good agreement was obtained, between the theoretical calculations and experimental measurements, strongly supporting the validity of the theoretical approach used (the β = 0.5, h' = 85.5 km profile assumed) and the conclusion that the increased attenuation observed for propagation to the south is an effect of the geomagnetic field."
"Thomson scatter observations of the F region at altitudes between 450 and 900 km are described; from them the bulk vertical velocity of the ambient electrons can be determined. These measurements were made possible by the construction of a new spectrum analyzer; they supplement earlier established programs to measure F-region densities and temperatures at Millstone Hill. The uncertainty in the results varies both with time of day and with altitude but is of the order of ±5 m/sec. Sample results are presented which show evidence of (1) thermal expansion and contraction of the layer and (2) oscillatory fluctuations attributed to traveling ionospheric disturbances."
"The method of averaging in the study of nonlinear oscillations is applied to the problem of resonant wave-wave interaction of a nonlinear dispersive wave system. The simplicity and directness of the method make it possible to study rather general and complex systems. Two examples are treated, one is posed as an initial value problem and the other as a boundary value problem. The second example deals with the acoustic-gravity wave system in the atmosphere. It is found that resonant condition can be satisfied for the three-wave system for which one of the waves is the zero frequency gravity wave. Through resonant interaction, the other two waves become trapped. The trapping depth is plotted for typical atmospheric parameters."
"Photoelectrons in the ionosphere result from the action of solar ultraviolet radiation on atmospheric gases. It is extremely difficult to study the energy, pitch-angle and spatial distributions of photoelectrons with a continuity equation approach because of the large variety and nature of the physical processes that must be considered. A Monte Carlo technique is well suited to simulate photoelectron diffusion through the atmosphere; one such method to deduce photoelectron distributions is described. Elastic and inelastic collisions with the neutral gases and Coulomb losses to thermal electrons are included. Illustrative results are presented for the photoelectron escape fluxes that result from the release of 20-ev electrons from various ionospheric altitudes."
"This is a companion paper to two other papers, one of which developed an approximate, closed-form solution of the Stratton-Chu vectorial integral equation for irregular boundaries. That development involved the evaluation of several integrals by the stationary phase method and assumed that the points of stationary phase were well separated. A second paper presented the correction factor for definite integrals that are evaluated by the stationary phase method. Here, this correction factor is incorporated as a weighting function to permit a superposition of the closed-form solutions for irregular screens or apertures without limitation on the spacing between adjacent points of stationary phase. This extended solution is then applied to evaluate the diffraction effects for a bilinear screen and compared with experimental data."
"The problem of a point electric dipole moving over a dispersive dielectric half-space is studied. The dipole is located in the free space above the dielectric and is assumed to be time harmonic in its rest frame, oriented perpendicular to the interface, and moving parallel to it. Solutions for this problem are obtained by using integral transform techniques. Expressions for the electric and magnetic fields in the free space region are formulated for the reflected radiation field for the case of an arbitrary, dispersive dielectric and for the lateral wave and surface wave fields for the case of a lossless plasma dielectric. In the rest frame of the source, it is found that all three waves exhibit the frequency of the source and that the field patterns are distorted by the relative motion. In the rest frame of the dielectric, it is found that each of the waves exhibits some form of Doppler shift (different from the primary wave) and that their field patterns are also distorted. It is also found that the criterion for existence of the lateral wave is not modified by the relative motion of the source and dielectric but that the criterion for existence of the surface waves is greatly modified by the relative motion. In addition, for velocities greater than some critical velocity, it is found that a new type of surface wave comes into existence."
"The fields of a dipole source located over a variable impedance surface are considered. A method of obtaining solutions of the integral equation for the tangential field is outlined. Numerical results are given for the resulting radiation patterns for an exponentially tapered variation of the surface impedance. It is shown that the tapering has the advantage of reducing the lobe structure of the low-angle radiation."
"The impedance of a small loop in magnetoplasma is derived for the cases of magnetic field normal to and parallel to the plane of the loop. The quasi-static and uniaxial approximation methods are used, and an argument is given to justify the uniaxial approximation as the more desirable method. The results of the theory are given in analytic form and are evaluated numerically and presented graphically. The loop impedance is seen to be much less plasma-dependent than the impedance of a short electric dipole. It is shown that the small loop can be an efficient radiator under certain plasma conditions. The results of laboratory measurement of loop impedance in magnetoplasma are also given for the cases of normal and parallel orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the plane of the loop. The laboratory plasma is generated by using a brush-electrode configuration. The measured impedance is compared with the theoretical predictions, and good agreement is shown for the perpendicular orientation. Quantitative agreement with the theory is not as good for the case of parallel orientation, but much of the gross impedance behavior is verified for this orientation, particularly the fact that the impedance is relatively plasma-dependent."
"Distortion of an electromagnetic pulse undergoing total internal reflection in inhomogeneous isotropic plasmas with special reference to the lower ionosphere has been investigated. The initial transient response and buildup of the reflected signal for different angles of incidence has been numerically investigated. It is seen that the signal builds up more rapidly for larger angles of incidence, and the dispersion is maximum for normal incidence of the pulse. This observation is in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations of Schmitt (196S) for uniform plasmas."
"A theory has been developed for the amplitude modulation of microwave signals propagated through a plasma created by an amplitude modulated RF field by taking into account the variations in the electron density and the electron molecule collision frequency of the plasma due to the modulation of the electron temperature. Experimental studies have verified the predicted dependence of the microwave modulation index on the modulation frequency, the exciting field strength, and the carrier modulation index. Slight deviations have been found between the experimental and theoretical values at both very low and very high modulation frequencies. The dependence of the RF conductivity on the exciting field has been suggested as the probable cause for the departures of the experimental values from the theoretical ones."
"In this paper, the propagation of an oblique E-mode electromagnetic wave in a plane stratified collision-free plasma is investigated. A singularity associated with the electric field near the plasma resonance is shown to disappear when the effect of the finite temperature of the plasma is taken into account. By allowing for a weak spatial dispersion, a fourth-order warm-plasma field equation is obtained, and a connection formula based on an analytical continuation of integral solutions is deduced. The connection formula is then applied to the problem of mode coupling between electromagnetic E waves and electrostatic plasma waves."
"Spatial statistical properties of a 39-km X-band propagation path developing near the ground have been investigated by means of the degree of coherence, which has been measured systematically over 3 months in the fall of 1968. A direct method of measurement has been worked out and has proved to be convenient in many respects. The method is based on the repeated plotting of the interference patterns obtained by a phase scanned interferometer. The measurements of the degree of coherence refer to three pairs of antennas that were permanently on site and were cyclically switched on the circuit of the interferometer. Results on the behavior of the degree of coherence with the time of day and with the progression of the autumnal season are reported. Distribution curves for the degree of coherence of the three pairs of antennas are also given. A practical use of the study is the appreciation of the gain deterioration of large antenna systems operating near the ground. This method may also be a novel approach to the electromagnetic probing of the atmosphere."
"Exact equations are derived for calculating the brightness temperature of a medium that is bounded by a plane surface and whose properties (dielectric constant and thermometric temperature) vary only with depth. Although no approximations are made in the development of the principal results, the final equations are presented in a form most convenient for use in the area of microwave radiometry (that is, in the limit where the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation to the Planck blackbody radiation law is valid). Some special cases in which the differential equations arising in the theory can be solved analytically are presented as examples. A practical numerical method for evaluating the exact equations by use of a digital computer is also discussed."
"The University of Illinois and the GCA Corporation launched a series of four Nike Apache rockets from Wallops Island, Virginia, on July 24, 1968, for the study of changes of lower ionosphere electron densities with solar zenith angle on the same day. An improved method of data analysis is outlined. Profiles of electron density for each of the four rockets are presented and compared with two profiles from years of quiet sun, 1964 and 1965. Evidence is found for an initial increase of free electrons followed by a decrease and then an increase in electron number density as the solar zenith angle changes from 94° to 18°. This pattern suggests a sequence of processes; i.e., electron detachment, recombination, and photo-ionization."
"The ionospheric spectrum of the critical frequency of the F2 region, foF2, is studied in detail at 35 locations during solar maximum and at 21 stations during solar minimum. The spectra contain prominent lines superposed on background continua. The most prominent lines correspond to solar periods of 24, 12, and 8 hours. Lines at half a lunar day (period of 12.48 solar hours) and at two lunisolar periods have also been detected in all the spectra investigated. The lunisolar lines have statistically significant amplitudes only at the low-latitude stations. Our analysis indicates the influence in the F region of plasma transport processes such as E × B drift, ambipolar diffusion, and ion-drag effects of the neutral air wind generated by the thermospheric diurnal density variations. An assessment of the roles of some of these processes is attempted in terms of the results obtained from our analysis."
"If (n) is the set of positive integers, spherical waves like ζn(1, 2) (kr)Pn(cos θ) in r, θ, ϕ spherical coordinates are used to develop a new approach to terrestrial radio wave field calculations. The spherical wave functions of integer order are used as building blocks for the solution of Maxwell's equations and boundary conditions. Instead of a direct summation of the zonal harmonics or n series, a double summation of a modified zonal harmonics series and the geometric series is used to obtain rapid convergence of the former. The most important disadvantage of an n-series summation is the construction of the solution at the ground interface, which generally causes the n series to converge slowly. This difficulty is overcome by the geometric series approach that permits removal of the ground wave from the n series. The ground wave is then calculated by using classical methods. The remaining ionospheric waves are then calculated with the integer-order spherical wave functions. The formulation presented is applicable to VLF, LF, and MF; anisotropic reflection coefficients based on electron and ion density profiles of the ionosphere are introduced into the analysis. Results obtained with a computer simulation of the formulas using integer-order spherical wave functions have been found to be in close agreement with another computer simulation of formulas using complex-order spherical wave functions at VLF. An interesting standing wave as a function of distance along the ionosphere and the ground has been found by using the integer-order techniques."
"Vertical and horizontal electric field mode sums are calculated for vertical, horizontal, and inclined point dipole radiators beneath a nighttime ionosphere for propagation to the east and to the west. The results indicate that in most circumstances the largest signal levels are obtained by recording the vertical electric field produced by a vertical antenna; however, there are circumstances in which horizontal dipoles for transmitting and/or receiving can be used to advantage."
"Slow-tail portions of atmospherics were recorded simultaneously in Japan and the United States from sources located in the Pacific Ocean area. The amplitude and phase spectra of forty pairs of selected atmospherics were computed, and propagation parameters for the zero-order wave-guide mode were calculated for nighttime conditions only. Attenuation rates for W–E propagation extended from about 0.5 db/Mm at 20 Hz to 2.0 db/Mm at 300 Hz and for E–W propagation from 0.8 db/Mm at 20 Hz to about 2.8 db/Mm at 300 Hz. The phase velocities extended from about 0.7 and 0.8 the velocity of light for W–E and E–W propagation, respectively, at 20 Hz to about 0.93 the velocity of light for either direction at 300 Hz."
"The reflection of a transient plane wave, from an ionospheric model with a linear electron-density profile, is considered. After a discussion of causality and physical realizability, the impulse response is calculated for the special case of no collisions. For this special case, it is shown that the wave form of the reflected wave has a smoothly rising initial portion that is followed by a slowly damped oscillatory portion which comprises the main signal."
"An exact expression is derived for the transient response of an arbitrarily modulated signal propagating through an ideal wave guide. The solution is in the form of an infinite series of Bessel functions, the coefficients of which depend in a simple manner on the time derivatives of the input signal. It is shown that for the specific example of a step-modulated carrier signal (the only earlier case for which an exact solution is known) the general expression reduces to that derived in earlier works. A particular case of a ‘double exponential’ pulse is evaluated and briefly discussed."
"The input resistance and the effective height are computed, with reference to several antennas in conductive environment in the limiting static case. For a gap type excitation, it is found that the above parameters are logarithmic functions of the gap thickness. Experiments performed on models confirming theoretical deductions are also reported. The possibility of extending static results to the dynamic case is also discussed, as well as the performance of the antennas in the more realistic semi-infinite (and possibly layered) conducting environment."
"The impedance of a short dipole antenna with a finite radius is considered using the Vlasov theory of the plasma rather than the simpler hydrodynamic theory. Analytic and numerical computations are presented for the longitudinal portion of the impedance. The results of this paper are compared with similar calculations for spherical antennas and filamental dipole antennas."
"No abstract is available."
"An elementary function that is closely related to the Sommerfeld flat-earth attenuation function is used to derive an alternative integral equation for propagation over irregular terrain. This choice of elementary function is shown to satisfy a scalar ‘parabolic’ wave equation. For the special case of a spherical earth, the integral equation yields more accurate results than previous general formulations; in addition, the integral equation is numerically feasible for both vertical and horizontal polarization."
"A method is given for producing world maps of plasma frequency that includes variation with height above the surface of the earth as well as variations with latitude, longitude, and local mean time. The maps, based on a numerical analysis of ionospheric data, are expressed in a functional form suitable for computer calculation of the value of plasma frequency and any of its partial derivatives at a given position and instant of time. The representation of vertical profiles of plasma frequency is based on a technique introduced by Lanczos for accelerating the convergence of trigonometric approximations. Diurnal and geographic variations are represented by methods previously developed for ionospheric mapping. An illustration is given using the monthly average value of plasma frequency for November 1966 from vertical profiles at 36 stations."
"The periodic variations in field strength and phase received from an inclined, elevated VLF transmitting antenna as the antenna is moved in a circular path (orbit) are calculated. This is a simplified model of a trailing-wire transmitting antenna carried by an orbiting aircraft. The earth-ionosphere waveguide propagation model with an isotropic homogeneous ionosphere is used. For an inclined orbiting antenna, the magnitude and sense (whether increasing or decreasing at a given time) of the variations are found to depend on the range of the receiver from the transmitter. For an antenna whose inclination angle oscillates with its orbital position, the orbit-produced variations are both range-dependent and bearing-dependent. Either one or two relative maximum values of field strength occur per orbit. Additional complications introduced by an anisotropic ionosphere are also considered."
"Standard ray-tracing programs do not calculate satisfactorily the reflection of LF radio waves from the ionosphere because they do not take losses into account. In lossy media, requiring the ray path to have a minimum attenuation in addition to a minimum wave interference gives a more accurate approximation to the full-wave solution. An extension of Fermat's principle, in which the complex phase refractive index is used instead of only the real part, expresses both of these criteria and leads to a corresponding extension of Snell's law or of Haselgrove's equations to calculate the ray path. Although such a path can have complex coordinates, only those with end points in real space are physically significant. An approximation, in which plane waves in the neighborhood of the receiver are assumed, solves the common ray-tracing problem of homing in on the receiver, a problem that is worse for ray tracing in complex space. Applying ray tracing in complex space to a plane wave incident on a plane stratified medium gives a result that agrees exactly with the result obtained by the phase integral method and that agrees satisfactorily with full-wave solutions above 30 kHz for all results shown."
"The zero-order term of the residue series has been employed to calculate the variation of field strength with distance over the earth's surface in the frequency band 7.8 Hz to 1 kHz. Spherical symmetry is assumed for the earth and ionosphere. The ionosphere is taken to be isotropic, but radial inhomogeneity is allowed. A vertical electric dipole source and a realistic propagation-constant model were assumed. The computations indicate the accuracy of the usual approximations to the residue series and enable the magnitude of the standing wave effects in the earth-ionosphere cavity to be assessed."
"The impedance of a sphere in a plasma is calculated for four different models. There are important differences between the four results. In particular, the real part of the impedance is shown to vanish at several frequencies above the plasma frequency for a spherical grid if the plasma is described by hydrodynamic equations. If the kinetic (Vlasov) equation is used, the nulls are changed into minima that are only noticeable if the radius is much greater than the Debye length and the frequency is not too far above the plasma frequency. If the hydrodynamic equations are used but the normal component of the fluid velocity is assumed to vanish on the (solid) sphere, there are no nulls or minima. The relationship of these results to previous work on antennas in plasmas is considered."
"The problem of the electromagnetic response of infinitesimal electric and magnetic dipole sources in a compressible, anisotropic electron plasma overlying a lossy dielectric half-space is solved by integral transform and matrix techniques to assess antenna radiation in the lunar environment. In part 1, the solutions are formulated in terms of Fourier-Bessel integrals operating on matrix quantities. In particular, the field solutions are shown to linear combinations of classical plane-wave modes in a compressible, anisotropic plasma. The introduction of a lossy dielectric half-space yields uncoupled TE and TM modes propagating into the dielectric plus three reflected plasma modes. The modal reflection coefficients represent reflections coupled to all plasma modes."
"The Fourier-Bessel integrals of part 1 (in this issue) are evaluated by the saddle-point method. By utilizing the arguments of ray optics, an algorithm is devised to find the saddle points by a numerical search procedure on dispersion surfaces. Reflection coefficients show a strong oscillatory structure as a function of frequency in the vicinity of the plasma frequency. This phenomenon is caused by rapid changes in ray convergence and by constructive-destructive interference of reflected modes. Branch-cut contributions yield lateral waves traveling along the dielectric boundary. The dominant lateral wave species is the modified extraordinary (MEX) mode launched by an acoustic-acoustic reflection. Other lateral waves are less important, and for these species, the position of the observer can go from the propagating zone to the shadow zone as the frequency is increased upward from the plasma frequency."
"Horizontal VLF transmitting dipole arrays are much easier and less expensive to construct than are the vertical VLF transmitting antennas in use at the present time. The horizontal dipoles have much greater power-radiating capability and bandwidth. The theoretical and experimental effects of mutual resistance on array efficiency gain over one dipole are presented. The radiation efficiency is greatly increased by increasing the wave velocity along the resonant dipole. Radiation characteristics of a theoretical 18-dipole array on Hawaiian lava are shown. The antenna radiation pattern needed to get omnidirectionl coverage at VLF is presented. It is shown that directivity is needed because of the nonreciprocal east-west propagation attenuation."
"Exact Wiener-Hopf solutions of the integral equations are presented. A simple relation is then proposed to relate the solutions of a semi-infinite tube and long finite tubes of the same radius. This relation is useful in a practical sense as a means of obtaining numerical solutions for one case from the solutions of the other."
"An analysis of the modes that can propagate in a parallel-plate waveguide with lossless reactive guiding surfaces is presented. Three cases are considered: (1) where both surfaces are inductive, (2) where both surfaces are capacitive, and (3) where one of the surfaces is inductive and the other is capacitive. In general, we found two surface waves and an infinite number of waveguide modes. Although all the waveguide modes exhibit the cutoff phenomenon, the surface wave modes may either propagate down to zero frequency or may be critical. At certain ‘threshold’ frequencies, a transition is observed from one to the other type of mode."

"Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of the decametric bursts from Jupiter were initiated by the University of Florida in 1964, with a tape-recording intensity interferometry operating at 18 MHz over a baseline of 55 km. This was apparently the first VLBI. Since the source was unresolved, subsequent observations were made with progressively longer baselines. The longest baseline is 7900 km (between Kentucky and Chile). Preliminary results indicate that if the S-burst sources are incoherent, at least some of them must be smaller than 0.1\" of arc."
"Several hydroxyl radical (OH) microwave emission sources were studied in July 1969 with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). The elements of the interferometer were the 84-foot telescope of the Onsala Space Observatory at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, and the 120-foot telescope of the Haystack Microwave Research Facility at Lincoln Laboratory, MIT; a baseline of 31.1 × 106 wavelengths, or a fringe spacing of 0.0066 sec of arc at a frequency of 1665 MHz, resulted. Earlier spectral line interferometric observations have given detailed information on the angular sizes and spatial separations of the 1665-MHz OH sources in the W3 source. The measurements reported here confirm these results and give additional information on the complex structure of the various features. Four other galactic OH emission sources with unknown angular sizes were also investigated. Only one (the 5-km/sec component in the 1667-MHz spectrum of W49) gave reliable fringes."
"The use of Loran-C transmissions for time and frequency synchronization has been discussed in a number of recent publications. This paper presents further developments of the techniques of relating Loran-C times of transmission with the universal time-coordinated (UTC) second. In addition, it reports on the current synchronization status of Loran-C transmissions and outlines typical instrumentation configurations for use with long baseline experiments as well as for other applications."
"The degree of delay-measurement precision that is achievable by very long baseline interferometry depends on the effective bandwidth of the recorded signals. Methods of extending the effective recorded bandwidth for a fixed tape-recorder bandwidth are examined in theory. Two major schemes (simultaneous recording of many widely separated frequency channels and recording sequentially different frequency channels) are examined in detail. Other techniques which involve rapid sampling and temporary ‘buffering’ of data bits are discussed. Methods of processing the data to achieve the maximum-likelihood estimates of phase delay, fringe phase, and fringe rate are derived. Factors that determine the optimum choice of frequency channels are discussed by using a delay ‘resolution or ambiguity’ function. This function is analogous to the beam-pattern function of a one-dimensional antenna array. Theoretical signal-to-noise ratios for the delay and fringe phase measurements are derived by using a simple vector representation of the signal and noise."
"A technique is proposed for the synchronization of widely separated microwave oscillators via satellite transponder. As a result of calculations of the phase shifts over the paths, computation of expected signal-to-noise ratios, and experiments on a 15-km line of sight path, synchronization to within 0.05 cycle rms for 10-GHz oscillators should be possible."
"High-accuracy measurements made by using very long baseline interferometry require corrections for the effects of the atmosphere. A ray-tracing analysis shows that the phase path through the troposphere differs from the free-space value by about 3 meters at the zenith. The ionospheric effect predominates at frequencies below 1 GHz. The net atmospheric correction in the experiment can be several tens of meters. To calculate the corrections, atmospheric probing is necessary at the same time and in the same direction as the observation of the radio source. Ionospheric probing methods do not have the desired accuracy, but the ionospheric effect can be taken out by observing at two frequencies. Although tropospheric probing is possible by radiometric measurements, the laser back-scattering approach appears to be more promising."
"A flexible, hybrid very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) instrumentation system, which uses videotape recorders for recording digitized data, has been developed for making routine observations for geodetic and geophysical measurements. The system records data on videotape in the field and later generates conventional digital magnetic tapes for programed correlation in a high-speed, general-purpose computer. By selection of an appropriate data rate, these tapes can be made compatible with the present National Radio Astronomy Observatory-Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory (NRAO-AIO) Mk 1 format. In addition, the major components have been designed and chosen so that they can be incorporated into the Mk 2 system now being developed at NRAO. This is a high-density, wide-bandwidth system that uses direct videotape correlation. Other more immediate advantages of using videotape recorders are: low initial cost, low cost per bit, long recording time, portability, and minimization of the field installation. This paper describes the entire instrumentation back end, including the video converter, recording system, and computer-compatible reformatting units. Station timekeeping, which is integral with the recording format, is also discussed."
"Very long baseline Michelson interferometry measurements were made on Io-related radio emissions from the planet Jupiter at 34 MHz. The data include a single baseline observation made on December 1, 1968, between the Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory (AIO) and Boulder, Colorado (436,000 X), and a three-station observation made on April 27, 1969, between the University of Maryland Radio Observatory in California, the University of Texas Radio Astronomy Observatory (UTRAO) in Texas, and Boulder, Colorado (typically 100,000 λ). Frequency analysis of the cross-correlated signals shows that there is a tendency toward lower observed fringe rates than had been calculated. If we interpret the results entirely in terms of source motion, the data imply a velocity near 200 km/sec eastward. We attribute the phase fluctuations in the cross-correlated signals to interplanetary scintillation; however, source motion effects cannot be distinguished from scintillation. The implied rms phase variations at the scintillation screen are 0.7 radian at an elongation of 65° (December 1, 1967) and 0.3 radian at an elongation of 145° (April 27, 1969)."
"In September and October of 1969 we performed an experiment at 6 and 2.8 cm between the 42-m telescope of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) at Green Bank, West Virginia, and the 22-m telescope of the Crimea Astrophysical Observatory at Simeis on the Crimea peninsula, USSR. The 8035-km baseline corresponded to a separation in wavelengths of 135 × 106 and 286 × 106 at 6 and 2.8 cm, respectively. Rubidium oscillators were used at both stations for time and frequency standards, except during the 6-cm observations when a hydrogen maser was used at Green Bank. The system temperatures for the interferometer were 125° and 210° K at 6 and 2.8 cm, respectively. The reduction of the observations was made on the computers at the California Institute of Technology and at NRAO."
"A relatively simple long baseline interferometer (LBI) system, which uses analog tape recorders, is described; it operates at decametric wavelength (26.3 MHz). A base station at Boulder with an array of 76 full-wave dipoles is used in conjunction with a small, readily portable antenna of sixteen full-wave dipoles that can be set up at various outlying field sites by two men in less than three hours. Commercial rubidium clocks are employed for timing and for local oscillator signals at each station. Tapes are aligned and data are correlated by an analog multiplier after each run at the base station. The use of pseudo-random code generators which can be reset and started on a given clock pulse at each station greatly simplifies tape alignment and system calibration."
"A hydrogen maser was installed at the Harvard College Observatory-Smithsonian 84-foot radio telescope in Harvard, Massachusetts, for very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) experiments in October, November, and December of 1969. The maser is a compact unit (42 by 22 by 22 inches) of relatively low power consumption, designed specifically for field use; it is readily transportable. A precision S-MHz crystal oscillator that is phase locked to the maser provides all frequency and time references for the VLBI receivers, recorders, and clocks. The maser was tuned against a rubidium standard by a rapid flux-switching technique; maser frequency resettability was estimated to be approximately ±3 × 10−13 with an over-all accuracy of approximately ±1 × 10−12. Loran-C was continuously monitored during the VLBI experiments, and the results of the Loran-C maser comparisons are included."
"The purpose of this note is to put to rest once and for all the use of an erroneous result derived from the linear (or exponential) height correlation coefficient in the physical optics formulation of rough surface scatter. The form of the correlation coefficient near the origin must be quadratic so that the physical optics integral can be evaluated asymptotically. Hence, the theoretical shape of the quasi-specular component for backscatter is not due to the nature of the correlation coefficient but to the form and behavior of the probability density function for the surface slopes evaluated for tilts near their mean values, the horizontal."
"The phase and amplitude characteristics of the near-field broadside to a long horizontal dipole operated close to ground level at very low frequencies can be used to obtain useful information about the nature of the subsurface media. This study is about antarctic glacial terrain and makes use of data collected recently in the Byrd glacier area to draw tentative conclusions about the nature of the glacial ice and underlying earth. Data obtained by use of this method suggest that the depth of the ice layer is in the neighborhood of 2250 meters, that the bulk relative complex dielectric constant of the ice may be approximated by the value 6.0 — j14 at 12.8 kHz, and that the conductivity of the underlying earth approaches 0.10 mho meter−1. A reflection coefficient of approximately 0.60 is indicated when plane waves arrive at vertical incidence at the surface of the ice. These figures are shown to be reasonable when compared with available data from other sources."
"D-region electron densities measured by rockets during the November 12, 1966, solar eclipse are shown to imply an effective recombination coefficient at an altitude of about 80 km of the order of 10-5 cm3 sec-1. The D-region electron densities between 65 and 83 km are computed for full-sun conditions assuming this value of recombination coefficient, the [37+] profile of Narcisi and Bailey [1965], and the NO profiles of Barth [1966], Pearce [1969], and Hesstvedt and Jansson [1969]. Electron densities between 60 and 65 km are estimated on the basis of the above-mentioned NO profiles and the negative-ion model of LeLevier and Branscomb [1968]. Also, electron densities between 80 and 90 km are computed by assuming an effective electron-ion recombination coefficient for NO+ and O2+ of 10-6 cm3 sec-1. There is a reasonable agreement between the computed electron densities and those measured by rockets launched from Wallops Island near 60° solar zenith angle. These results suggest that variability of D-region electron densities may be caused by changes in H2O vapor concentration induced by atmospheric circulation or eddy transport effects."
"A prototype single-pulse ionospheric sounding system has been devised at the Radio Physics Laboratory of Stanford Research Institute. The sounding system was installed and operated at a field site near Menlo Park, California, between July 1968 and January 1969. From a single transmitted RF pulse, it has been possible to obtain a vertical-incidence ionogram over a frequency range exceeding 7 MHz. In addition, the very narrow (nominally 1 μsec) transmitted pulse of the system has permitted the detection and identification of E-region echoes < 600 meters thick, a determination not possible with conventional sounders."
"The E,-echo phase path records on 5.6 MHz have shown that the bottom surface of the E, was sometimes very sharply bounded. Some evidence showing that the formation of E, is a highly localized phenomenon has been obtained. The phase path variations of ‘O’ and ‘X’ components in the F2-region echo during the formation of E, showed that the increase in the ionization in the E, is not totally from a vertical redistribution of the ionization along the ray paths. From spaced phase path records of E, echoes taken during the daylight hours, apparent drift speeds in the range 40–130 m/sec with an eastward sense of the east-west components of E, apparent drifts were observed. This is opposite to the sense of the east-west components of E-region drifts during the daylight hours but is the same as that during the nighttime hours. An attempt is made to interpret these observations."
"A large number of ionograms recorded at Arecibo have been converted to electron density profiles. It is shown that the method of analysis can give very high accuracy for a single layer, but the presence of an E layer can result in systematic errors in the shape of the F layer. Backscatter observations taken at the same times as the ionograms have been analyzed to give electron density curves with a height resolution of 9 km. Although there is a wide range of variation in the shape and height of the ionospheric layers, there is in general close agreement between the profiles obtained by the two methods."
"In this note it is shown that a recently found theorem [Booker et al., 1968] relating the reflexion coefficients for electromagnetic scattering from a variety of stratified media to each other in a simple way is inapplicable in cases where a static magnetic field is present. Calculations of VLF propagation in the lower ionosphere can therefore not be simplified by a utilization of the above-mentioned theorem."
"An approximate dispersion relation for hydromagnetic waves is derived from the macroscopic equations of the plasma. Collision terms corresponding to collisions between electrons, ions, and neutrals are included in the macroscopic equations, and the three collision frequencies involved are retained in the approximation. Some simplification results from omission of certain terms in the macroscopic equations on the basis of an estimate of their relative magnitudes. An arbitrary direction of propagation is assumed in the derivation of the dispersion relation. The propagation constants for propagation parallel and normal to the magnetic field are represented by fairly simple expressions. There is good agreement between the numerical values of real and imaginary parts of the refractive index for these two directions of propagation and the various ionospheric heights computed from the approximative fomulas and from a more rigorous dispersion relation."
"The author describes and analyzes a method for correcting the aberration of nonparabolic mirrors by using a phase-corrected multiple-beam source consisting of an array of radiating elements fed through a Butler matrix. This source, which is identical to a phase-modulated point source, is shown to be able to correct any mirror profile, the only limitation being the dimension of the source. The case of a plane mirror is examined first. An experimental mockup that uses an offset, illuminated plane mirror is measured. This mockup shows clear focusing of the mirror and magnification of the directivity of the source. The case of a mirror of circular profile is then analyzed theoretically, and the possibilities of correction as a function of the geometrical parameters are computed, taking into account the accepted phase error and the obstruction ratio obtained."
"The held of a perfectly conducting, infinitely long, cylindrical antenna with a slice generator excited by a step-function voltage wave form is computed at several positions in space. For field points remote from the source, analytical simplifications are possible, and the case where the antenna is loaded with uniform resistance can then be treated. A simple formula for determining the generator voltage wave form required to radiate a specified far-field wave form is derived."
"The diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is determined under the condition that the aperture phase function is ξ(r) cos f', where (r, f') are polar coordinates in the aperture and function ξ(r) defines the radial variation of phase. The asymmetric phase error causes beam squint and distortion of the radiation pattern. The diffraction pattern is calculated by computer methods assuming ξ(r) = βr2 and ξ(r) = βr3, where β= 0, π/4, and π/2 rad. The edge taper of the aperture field is specified as 0 db, —12 db, and —20 db. An integral formula is derived for calculating um, the position of the pattern maximum. The analysis is used to determine the beam squint of a satellite-mounted reflector antenna that undergoes asymmetric distortion in the space environment."
"Exact expressions are obtained for the fields of a step-function excited electric dipole in a homogeneous medium of infinite extent. Special cases include a conducting dielectric medium and a cold lossless plasma."
"The derivation of an analytic formula for the impedance of cylindrical and helical antennas in cold magnetoplasma is outlined. The method used is a conventional one reducing to integration of a three-dimensional integral involving the Fourier transforms of the current distribution and tensor Green's function. It is shown that the impedance decomposes into three parts corresponding, respectively, to the axial and circumferential components of current, and a mutual impedance depending on both current components. The explicit formulas are in the form of one-dimensional integrals suitable for machine computation. The integrands are made up of many simple terms, and for brevity only the impedance terms referring to the axial current are written out explicitly."
"Power patterns are presented for VLF radiation (500 Hz to 30 kHz) from arbitrarily oriented, point magnetic and electric dipole sources in a two-component, slightly lossy magnetoplasma. The patterns show that energy tends to be transported primarily along the magnetic axis of a confinement cone for higher VLF frequencies but that the inclusion of ion motion destroys the confinement cone for extremely low frequencies."
"The problem of wave propagation in a warm magnetoplasma in the presence of random density fluctuations is studied. Using a perturbation technique similar to the renormalization procedure in field theory, a dispersion relation for plane coherent wave propagation is derived. For propagation along the magnetic field, the coherent longitudinal and transverse modes are found to be independent. But there is coupling among the modes for the random waves scattered by the irregularities. The coupling is strong for short correlation length of the turbulence. Attenuation constants for the coherent waves are obtained, and the effect of random scattering on the Faraday rotation phenomenon is discussed."
"A new method for obtaining exact analytical expressions for some statistical functions of an optical wave propagating through a randomly turbulent medium is reported. A power-series solution of the wave equation (s2 + k2n2(x))u(x) = 0 is derived for a homogeneous random-refractive-index field n(x). Exact analytical expressions are obtained for the average wave function áu(x)ñ and the two-point correlation function áu(L, r1)u∗(L, r2)ñ, with the added assumption that n(x) is a Gaussian random process always close to unity. The intensity correlation function áI(L, r1)I(L, r2)ñ is investigated, and recent experimental results regarding the behavior of the intensity fluctuations are discussed."
"A method is given for determining electron-density and collision-frequency distributions in the lower ionosphere from VLF and LF sounder data. Error limits are placed on the distributions by mapping the standard errors of the data into error limits on the ionosphere parameters. Interpretation of the error limits is discussed, especially in regard to the relationship between the resolution of a distribution and its error band. Examples are given that illustrate the method."
"The ionization model developed in conjunction with VLF and HF propagation parameters from our analysis of the PCA's of August 28 and September 2, 1966, is applied in unmodified form to the 1967 events of January 28, February 2, May 23, and May 28. As for the 1966 events, proton intensities, energies, and cutoffs measured on the polar orbiting satellite 1963–38C are successfully connected to VLF phase disturbances and multifrequency riometer absorption increases. Considering all these events, the model provides the following rms fits between observed and computed values: 4.0 μ sec for 141 daytime and nighttime VLF phase values for seven paths at five frequencies during six proton events; 0.45 db for 181 riometer absorption values at 30 MHz during the six events; and 0.20 db for 36 riometer absorption values at 50 MHz during the two events that produced this absorption. The variability of the proton intensities and spectrums provides a rigorous test of the validity and internal consistency of the ionospheric model deduced through the complementary use of riometer absorption and VLF propagation changes occurring during PCA's. In the present analysis, as in the preceding one, the temporal variations in the proton cutoffs play an important role in the VLF analysis as a result of the lengths of the VLF transmission paths in relation to the polar-cap area disturbed by the solar protons."
"Studies of the Doppler frequency dispersion on a multiple high-frequency phase stable propagation link were made at a low-latitude site under a variety of geomagnetic disturbance conditions. Frequency stability of the system enabled us to measure ionospheric-induced Doppler frequency changes as low as 0.01 Hz. The average Doppler frequency changes during development of the reflecting region at dawn can be characterized consistently by an exponential decrease of positive frequency versus time as the critical frequency of the F-region increases. The power spectral density of the fluctuations in Doppler frequency was usually nearly white over the fluctuation period range 1 < τ < 20 minutes. The power spectral density magnitude correlates well with the planetary magnetic disturbance index Kp summed over the period of the observations. This result suggests that the observed effects are related to irregular movements of the F region. Occasional coherent-appearing spectral peaks were observed that may be a manifestation of wave energy in the acoustic window propagated to ionospheric altitudes. No obvious relationship between the appearance of these coherent disturbances and the tropospheric weather pattern could be found."
"The propagation of ELF electromagnetic pulses in the earth-ionosphere cavity is considered with special reference to ‘slow tail’ atmospherics. The problem is formulated in the frequency domain; inversion to the time domain is achieved by a numerical evaluation of the Fourier transform. The propagational model employed involves a spherical earth with a concentric, spherically stratified, inhomogeneous, isotropic ionosphere. The pulse source assumed represents the median return stroke of a lightning discharge. Both short-range propagation and long-range propagation are considered. Particular attention is paid to the nature of the electric- and magnetic-field components of the pulse in the vicinity of the antipode of the source."
"An anisotropic ionosphere causes coupling between TE and TM modes; for any given mode the field components of a horizontal electric dipole remain finite for both the axial and end-fire directions. During the daytime the ionospheric anisotropy is relatively weak, and the vertical electric fields Eτ of an elevated horizontal electric dipole exhibit a minimum near the broadside direction for west-to-east (WE) and (at short distances) for east-to-west (EW) propagation; during nighttime the fields exhibit maximum values near the broadside direction. For elevated sources and observation points, the transverse electric horizontal field component Eϕ of a horizontal electric dipole becomes comparable to E, of a vertical electric dipole. Inclined electric dipoles exhibit amplitude variations of the vertical electric fields Eτ with changes of direction relative to the dipole axis. The amplitude variations are particularly pronounced for the EW direction of nighttime propagation."
"In this paper, we outline a derivation for and present calculations for the mode conversion at an elevated coastline between sea and land. It is shown that the land elevation above sea level will modify the conversion coefficients, particularly when the propagation is from land toward sea."
"The work discussed in the present paper was undertaken in response to difficulties experienced with numerical integration approaches. The technique involves the modeling of the medium as a set of horizontal strata in which the ambient gas parameters are ‘nearly’ constant, i.e., slowly varying. A perturbation theory allows us to take into account the slow vertical variation in a purely analytical way that is based on a knowledge of the system-equation solutions for a homogeneous medium. The computer is used to find eigenvalues of the system matrix and to provide the numerical coefficients for the solution matrix, which is expressed analytically as a function of z, the vertical distance coordinate. Illustrative numerical results are presented that show eigenvalues (corresponding to modes of propagation) and certain elements of the solution matrix for a typical ionospheric parameter regime."
"The effect on Faraday rotation of stratification in an ionized medium parallel to the direction of propagation is examined. An expression suitable for a general inhomogeneity profile is obtained in a series form. A closed-form solution is also discussed with reference to a lens-like medium described by a parabolic inhomogeneity profile. The departure of rotation from the first-order value is shown to have a strong dependence on the nature of the inhomogeneity distribution. Near the focal points within a focusing medium, the Faraday effect is found to exhibit an anomalous behavior in that rotation changes sign through a large swing in amplitude."
"Sommerfeld diffraction functions are used to develop a general method of solution for a class of two-dimensional half-plane diffraction problems for which the boundary conditions contain first- and second-order derivatives. The diffraction functions are themselves wave functions and satisfy both the radiation and the edge conditions. In comparison with the Wiener-Hopf technique frequently used for such problems, this method is considerably simpler and easier to apply. Problems involving multimode surface reactances and half-plane scatterers imbedded in anisotropic plasma and ferrite media are solved as examples."
"A study is presented of the backscattering from two identical, perfectly conducting, thin cylinders illuminated by a plane wave at an arbitrary angle of incidence. The theory is based on an integral equation method. By decomposing the induced currents into symmetric and antisymmetric modes, the simultaneous integral equations for the induced currents are converted into independent integral equations similar to the one for a single cylinder for which the solution has already been carried out. The induced current on the cylinders and the backscattering cross sections of the cylinders are determined. Comparisons are made between the calculated and the measured values of the echo area. The experimental results are in good agreement with theory."
"Eigenvalues of spheroidal wave functions are calculated as functions of complex propagation constants; they are displayed on a complex plane to form ‘eigenvalue charts.’ These charts show that the eigenvalues have many branch points in the complex planes of their arguments. The values of the branch points and the corresponding eigenvalues are then calculated exactly; a range of several points is shown in a table. These values are the universal constants; they are very important, because they are the basis for determining a complete set of spheroidal wave functions, they give the circle of convergence of the power-series expansions of the eigenvalues, and they also aid in the discovery of domains in which the eigenvalues are obtained by either prolate or oblate asymptotic expansions."
"The voltage at the terminal of each half of a phase-monopulse antenna is induced by the incident wave and by the electromagnetic fields scattered from the other half of the antenna. In phase-scanned arrays, the asymmetrical scattering by the antenna of the waves that are incident from a direction other than broadside introduces a tracking error into the system. A qualitative investigation of the cause of the pointing error indicates that the error is dependent on the spacing between the halves of the antenna and on the radiation and scattering patterns of the subarrays. Carter's formulas for mutual impedance are used to give a more accurate estimate of the magnitudes of the pointing error and error slope that are caused by the mutual scattering in arrays of dipoles. The results of the calculations for arrays of half-wavelength dipoles can also be used to describe the pointing error in arrays of slots on an infinite planar conductor, which serve as an approximation to slot arrays on a finite planar conductor."
