"Major improvements have been made in radio-telegraph transmission over a period of years, but the improvement resulting from signaling by frequency shift instead of interruption of the carrier wave has been achieved in practice only recently. These matters are discussed, and associated with a number of references to other work in this field. A description is given of dual-diversity receiving equipment, employing audio-frequency filters for separation of \"mark\" and \"space\" signals. The equipment is intended for use on direct-printing, commercial telegraph circuits."
"The common civil military program for navigational aids for use on and off the airways is based on a polar co-ordinate system from which a pilot may obtain his position relative to a known ground location. This navigational information is supplied in the form of azimuth and distance measurement from any preselected ground facility. Under this program, azimuth information is supplied by the vhf omnnirange which is now being installed on a country-wide basis. Development work on the final version of the other parameter of the navigation system, namely, the distance-measuring equipment, is nearly completed and plans are being made to add that equipment to the vhf omnirange facilities in the near future. Addition of the distance-measuring equipment to the instrument landing system (ILS) to provide continuous distance information to the runway touchdown point also is contemplated. The distance-measuring equipment, commonly referred to as DME, employs pulse techniques and the interrogator-transpondor or challenge-reply principle so widely used in identification equipment during World War II. A portion of the frequency band, 960 to 1,215 mc, assigned to aids to air navigation, is being used for DME implementation. This report outlines the history and development of the present nationally adopted 100-channel DME, and describes the modifications necessary to convert earlier 50-channel equipment into equipment suitable for operating within a 100-channel system. In operation, the aircraft unit of the DME, commonly called the interrogator, continuously transmits a train of short duration rf pulses."
"This paper gives general information on single-conductor transmission lines, in particular on lines having a dielectric-coated conductor. A design chart is included and experimental results are presented."
"Low RC time constants, small physical size, low operating voltages, and, in many units, a current gain in excess of unity make transistors promising for trigger-circuit applications. Trigger action can be obtained with a single transistor if its current gain exceeds unity. Mathematical analysis indicates the possibility of triggering with successive pulses of the same polarity by use of an additional crystal diode. Improvement in some respects is obtained if a transistor is used in conjunction with a vacuum-tube cathode follower."
"A reactance tube circuit acting as a sinusoidally varying capacity in the frequency range from 20 to 200,000 cps is used to compensate the capacity variations of a condenser microphone in a high-frequency carrier circuit. The microphone is driven as in the electrostatic actuator method by a voltage of the same frequency, that modulates the reactance tube capacity. By adjusting amplitude and phase of the reactance tube modulation, the total capacity change of the circuit becomes zero. The sensitivity and phase lag of the microphone response can be determined from the actuator and modulating voltages when the circuit is properly calibrated. The circuit is advantageous in obtaining an equivalent pressure chamber calibration of condenser microphones up to 200 kc. The null method makes it useful for relatively unsensitive microphones."
"Grid emission leads to unstable control characteristics in thyratrons. Positive ion grid current during the afterglow results in delayed recovery of grid control. Both these drawbacks can be overcome by use of low values of grid resistors, but at the expense of input signal current sensitivity. The requirement for low grid resistance can be eliminated by assigning the firing function to a fine wire electrode known as the trigger grid. The other function of a conventional thyratron grid, which is to promote recovery of control, is assigned to another electrode known as the blocking grid. Since the latter electrode is connected to a bias supply through a low resistance, its emission and positive ion collection do not produce disturbing effects. Comparisons of an experimental trigger grid thyratron with its conventional prototype reveal many advantages of the former."
"The theory of tropospheric scattering of radio waves recently advanced by Booker and Gordon makes the prediction that radio-frequency energy may arrive from a ground-based very-high-frequency transmitter at angles well above the horizon, and also that signals received as a result of the scattering process will attenuate less rapidly with distance if the polarization of the source is horizontal than if it is vertical. Experimental observations made at wavelengths of 3 meters and 3 centimeters have verified these deductions."
"A new theory for the resolution of a modulated signal into its radio-frequency spectrum is presented. It is shown that this theory is mathematically equivalent to previous methods of analysis. The component theory introduces physical concepts which give an understanding of the process of formation of sidebands. Examples are worked using an analytical method of analysis. The theory also naturally leads to a graphical method which is applicable without harmonic analysis of the modulation. The concepts apply without modification to any type of modulation although special emphasis is given to frequency modulation."
"A review of three possible methods of measuring or estimating adjacent-band radiation characteristics of a radio transmitter is given. These three methods differ in the type of signal applied to the transmitter and may be termed the two-tone, normal signal, and thermal noise methods. Measurements on a multichannel single-sideband transmitter using each of these methods are presented to show that there is a good correlation between the normal signal and thermal noise methods. An empirical method for calculating the slope of the adjacent-band radiation as a function of frequency from the measured two-tone distortion values is given, and the measured and calculated slopes are shown to be in fairly good agreement."
"A description is given of a broad-band vhf-uhf antenna for a small, single-engine type of aircraft consisting of the vertical stabilizer that is tip-fed by the metal tail cap. The resulting antenna covers the frequency range of 100 to 400 mc, is vertically polarized, and has radiation patterns that are essentially omnidirectional. It is a zero-drag type of antenna that is very adaptable to aircraft production techniques. The tail cap, together with the rest of the vertical stabilizer, performs as a vertical sleeve-fed stub on an unsymmetrical ground plane. For this reason, the antenna radiation fields are not perfectly omnidirectional, but they are adequate for two-way communication in the frequency range 100 to 400 mc, and in this range the standing wave ratio on RG-8/U 50-ohm coaxial cable is less than 2 to 1. The predicted radiation field-strength patterns for a specified transmitter power are calculated from measured radiation field patterns of the scale-model aircraft and full-scale standing-wave ratio measurements."
"The patterns of small dipole and loop antennas mounted on or near a perfectly conducting cylinder of elliptical cross section are calculated by determining the open-circuit terminal voltages of the antennas when receiving plane waves. The antennas are assumed to be such that they cause negligible distortion of the field when they are open-circuited, thus reducing the problem to that of calculating the diffraction of a plane wave around the cylinder. The results have applications in the design of aircraft antennas and slotted-cylinder antennas."
"The current distribution on a uniform circular helix has been measured over a frequency band extending from 600 to 1,700 mc. Although the measured distributions are highly complex functions of distance and also change in an anomalous manner with frequency, it is possible to analyze the distributions in terms of traveling waves associated with three different transmission modes on the helix. The relative amplitude functions of these traveling waves, as well as their associated phase velocities, are approximated. Current distributions which have been calculated by superposing three or more traveling waves are in good agreement with the measured data."
"The relative response of directive antennas is dependent on the mechanism whereby the energy is conveyed. This fact, which often seems to be neglected, is of particular importance when the energy arriving at a receiving antenna can be represented in terms of a spectrum of incoherent plane-wave components. Such may be true frequently in the extraoptical propagation of microwaves. A study of an idealized situation is presented which compares the behavior of several pencil-beam antennas of varying aperture. A brief comparison with some recent observations is made."
"The parameters determining ring time for an echo box in a radar system are examined, and the conditions for optimum ring time established. Two specific arrangements, namely, the echo box coupled directly to the guide and the echo box coupled through a directional coupler, are treated in detail. Representative curves of ring time as functions of various parameters, and curves of power extracted by the echo box are included. It will be seen that simply increasing the loaded Q of a cavity will not increase the ringing time past a certain maximum, and that there is an optimum value of loaded Q which is a function of the radar power, receiver sensitivity, pulse length, and the method of coupling the cavity to the transmitter."
"The proof of a theorem useful in analyzing the response of certain types of circuits to modulated signals and examples of the use of the theorem are presented."
"The term \"constant-resistance network\" is generally used to describe a fixed network whose input impedance is a constant independent of frequency. The present paper generalizes the concept of constant-resistance networks by extending this concept to linear varying-parameter systems. It is shown that any self-dual variable network is a constant-resistance network and this result is used to obtain such constant-resistance structures as the lattice and the bridged-tee. Explicit expressions for the transfer functions of these structures are derived and an illustrative example involving a constant-resistance variant of Cowan's modulator is considered. In addition to self-dual structures, a non-self-dual type of constant-resistance network is described and the possibility of using this structure as a constant-resistance capacitive modulator is indicated."
"It is well known that distortion is suffered by a modulated wave in passing through a practical transmission network. The increasing use of frequency modulation in television relays and other uses where high fidelity is important has made the problem of FM distortion of current interest. One of the earliest analytical approaches to the problem was by Carson and Fry and later applied by Jaffe to single- and double-tuned circuits. The Carson and Fry method depends on a series solution to obtain numerical results. The theory to be developed is based on a series solution of the superposition integral. A recent approach along this line is by Bradley. He obtained a rapidly convergent series that is useful when the network transfer function is in a form which permits separation of attenuation and phase of the network and can be differentiated conveniently. It is the purpose of this paper to provide a method of calculating distortion, when the transfer function is known in pole and zero form, that is rapidly convergent under most cases considered in practice."

"Modern broadcast radio receivers of the superheterodyne type are frequently sources of spurious radiation from the local oscillator, which radiation may cause severe interference with other services. In addition, in the case of television broadcast receivers, there may be radiation of power from other sources beside the local oscillator. In this standard the potential sources of spurious radiation from frequency modulation and television broadcast receivers are described and methods of measurement whereby the strength of some of these radiations may be determined are set up. Where the methods for the two classes of receivers differ, the specifications for each are outlined.<>"

"The high lights of the history of color measurement and of color photography are reviewed. Following this introduction, the principles of modern 3-color colorimetry are developed from a hypothetical experiment in color matching. The conventional theory of \"perfect color reproduction\" by color television is built up from colorimetric background. Some of the difficulties to be expected in applying colorimetry to color television are brought out. Finally, there is some discussion which tends to show that colorimetry may not be a sufficiently powerful tool to provide answers to all of the questions which will arise in the reproduction of scenes in color by television. The advantage of colorimetry as a background is indicated, however."
"This is a report on the first numerical results to come from a laboratory experiment on the subjective sharpness of additive 3-color pictures. The sharpness factor is isolated by using out-of-focus projection (of slides) instead of actual television transmission. An observer's acuity for defocus is greatest for the green component and least for the blue component, in an additive 3-color picture. When the same picture is reproduced in monochrome (white, red, green, or blue) at the same brightness, his acuity for defocus is equal to that found for the green component."
"This paper is the first of a series which covers Radio Corporation of America work on color-television cathode-ray picture reproducers (color kinescopes) for the home. Minimum reproducer requirements are here considered to be high-light brightness and resolution equal to or exceeding that achieved in the present United States black-and-white television system and large-area three-color fidelity which encompasses the major part of the horseshoe-like area of the chromaticity diagram of the International Commission on Illumination (ICI). Color phosphors with electron-beam excitation meet the requirements. One color-kinescope method, which requires the beam to be accurately positioned at all times during scanning on a screen of adjacent subelemental color-phosphor areas, has practical disadvantages. In a second method, using a similar type of kinescope, the beam position controls the color signal; although accurate scanning is not required, some of the disadvantages are the same. A third method, which uses adjacent complete picture images, optically combined, has little to offer over the use of three separate color tubes. A phosphor screen, whose color can be changed by a difference in electron-beam velocity or current density, has attractive features, but is not available in practical form. Methods of considerable interest are those whereby either the electron beam is electrically controlled at the phosphor screen for changing color or whereby shadowing techniques are employed to produce a direction-sensitive color screen."
"A three-gun shadow-mask color kinescope is described as well as construction techniques. The beams, from three guns mounted together in a 2-inch diameter neck, are deflected by a single deflection yoke. The guns are pointed so that the electron beams converge to a spot on a thin, perforated metal sheet that acts as a mask and is located a short distance away from a viewing screen composed of many phosphor dots. Associated with each hole in the mask is a trio of phosphor dots capable of emitting the three primary colors, red, blue, and green. The dots are so placed that each electron beam as it scans can \"see\" only one dot of the trio. Each of the three beams is thus capable of exciting one color only, and when all three beams áre modulated with the appropriate primary color information, a picture in full color can be reproduced. An apparatus called the \"lighthouse\" is used to record the locations of the phosphor dots on a photographic plate placed behind the mask and in the plane of the phosphor screen. A point source of light, at the position from which the deflection of one of the beams appears to take place, is used to simulate the electron beam in recording the phosphor dot positions. The pattern for one color of phosphor is the same as for the other two colors, and the geometry of the hole system in the mask is such that the three phosphor patterns nest together perfectly."
"A direct-view shadow-mask three-color kinescope employing a single electron gun is described. Color selection in this tube is accomplished by controlling the direction of approach of a single electron beam to a direction-of-approach sensitive color screen. For sequential presentation the beam is shared in time sequence between the three primary colors. For simultaneous presentation the beam is shared continuously among the three primary colors. The new problems presented by the one-gun shadow-mask color kinescope arise from the special requirements placed on the electron optical system, from the need for deflecting the beam into different color positions, and in the case of sequential presentation, from the necessity for blanking-off the beam as it is switched from one color position to the next. Practical solutions to these and other problems are presented."
"The 45 degree reflection-type color kinescope is an experimental tube of the single gun type in which the color is changed by applying a control voltage directly to the screen assembly. The screen assembly consists of a multi-apertured metal plate coated on the front side with red, green, and blue phosphor strips and mounted parallel to a glass plate coated with a transparent conductive film. An electron beam scans the back of the metal plate at an angle of incidence of approximately 45 degrees. The portion of the beam passing through the slots is reflected by the electric field between the plates, causing it to fall back on one set of phosphor strips. By varying the potential of the glass \"reflector\" plate, the beam can be shifted from one color phosphor to another. The scanning beam is not required to follow the aperture pattern and the color purity is independent of beam focus. A feature of this tube is the automatc registry of the three colors over all parts of the screen. The screen is not difficult to construct; the power required to switch colors at megacycle frequencies is small. Other characteristics of this tube which should be noted are: the unconventional shape of the bulb, and the need, in some forms of the tube, for a \"keystoning\" correction of the scanning. Experimental one-gun tubes having screens seven inches in diameter have been built and operated with the RCA color system."
"A new color kinescope makes use of a series of closely spaced screens, each covered with a different primary color phosphor and separated from each other by fine mesh control grids. Small voltage changes of these grids control the depth of penetration of the scanning beam or beams into this assembly of screens. This arrangement permits individual excitation of any one or combination of the primary colors which go to make up the colored image. Experimental tubes have been built, first in two-color form to test principles, and then in three-color form. They have been operated with a color picture using the RCA color television system signal."
"A color-television receiver employing a single kinescope of the line-screen type has been developed. The kinescope screen consists of many hundred narrow parallel phosphor strips of the three primary colors, arranged cyclically. In the method investigated in greatest detail, the raster scanning lines are parallel to the phosphor strips. Circuit means are provided to cause the scanning lines to coincide with the phosphor strips of a single color. The beam is then deflected by a \"stair-step\" wave to the adjacent lines of the two remaining colors to generate color-dot areas in synchronism with the received color signal. The required registration of scanning lines with the screen elements is obtained by means of a servo circuit deriving control information from secondary-emission-signal areas on the kinescope screen. Various alternatives to this arrangement have also been investigated. Kinescopes of 16-inch envelope diameter have been employed to give color pictures of high horizontal definition and adequate color purity."
"A technique has been developed whereby fine-detail printed patterns of color phosphors are deposited onto a glass surface suitable for use as the viewing screen in a color reproducer of the cathode-ray type. The phosphors, suspended in a lacquer, are squeegeed in turn through a stainless-steel-mesh-supported gelatin stencil. The lacquer is subsequently entirely removed by simple bakeout in air at elevated temperature. The glass plate is rigidly fixed by vacuum onto a table which can be accurately adjusted in two horizontal perpendicular directions. Exact position of the glass on the table is indicated by two dial gauges; the accuracy attained is such as to intermesh the three color phosphor patterns to better than 0.001 inch over the entire area. Phosphor screens have been made in substantial quantities for several types of color kinescopes, and have given very satisfactory performance."
"The three-beam gun assembly for the aperture-mask tri-color kinescope consists of three guns located so that their axes are mutually parallel, equidistant from, and spaced 120 degrees about the axis of the assembly. The No. 4 grids open into a large common cup. The three electron beams are converged to a point on the aperture mask by an electrostatic lens formed between the large cup and the conductive neck coating. The focus of the individual beams is controlled mainly by the voltage applied to grid No. 3. The potentials of grids Nos. 3 and 4 may be varied in synchronism with the scanning frequencies so as to maintain beam focus and convergence over the entire screen area. The individual guns, of glass-beaded construction, are held in position by support spacers welded to eyelets around the gun cylinders. Many standard-type gun parts and manufacturing procedures are used. The beam spacing and gun placement are related to the design dimensions of the screen assembly. The guns are positioned with accurately machined, three-fingered fixtures which use the gun apertures as reference positions. Separate leads for cathodes and grids Nos. 1 and 2 of the three guns permit adjustment of grid drive charactexistics so the ratios of three beam currents are constant with grid drive. Thus, correct color is maintained, independent of changes in brightness. A variation of the parallel-beam type of gun uses a single set of cylinders in which triple-aperture disks are placed in appropriate positions."
"The alignment requirements of the aperture-mask color kinescope, combined with the necessity of maintaining the alignment of aperture mask and glass phosphor plate during the operation of sealing the viewing-screen assembly within the tube, have resulted in the development of new assembly methods and techniques. The aperture mask of copper-nickel alloy is stretched tightly on one side of the spacer frame and the phosphor-dot plate is loosely clamped on the opposite side; alignment of the two parts is maintained by a fixed pin at one end of the frame and a sliding pin at the other. The two-piece metal-shell construction permits insertion of alignment fixtures for glass-neck and electron-gun sealing prior to the installation of the screen assembly. A reference plane is provided for these operations by screen-assembly mounting posts inside the shell. An internal high-permeability magnetic shield is also fastened to these posts. The final envelope seal is made by welding together the flanges on the two shell sections by means of an inert-gas arc. These flanges help to protect the tube faceplate and viewing-screen assembly from mechanical and thermal damage during the welding operation."
"The two basic requirements for proper operation of the aperture-mask tri-color kinescope are that the deflection center and the color center of each of the three beams be coincident, and that the beams converge to a point at the aperture mask. Dimensional deviations which occur in manufacture are discussed in terms of variations from the condition of coincident deflection and color centers. The effects of manufacturing variations in the placement of the aperture array and phosphor arrays relative to each other are divided into two general types: the displacement of an array or part of an array within its plane, and the displacement perpendicular to the plane of an array. If the displacement within a plane is uniform in magnitude and direction, a uniform shift of the position of the color centers within the color plane results. If the displacement is not uniform or contains a rotational component, each section of the screen has a unique color center resulting in a confused or enlarged color center for the entire screen. With the second type, the displacements normal to the plane of the array, uniform stretching or contraction of either array can be included because these variations in dimensions cause the color centers to be displaced normal to the plane of the screen. Complete compensation can be made in the finished tube for those manufacturing variations which affect only the position of the color centers."
"This paper discusses the magnetic deflection of a number of closely spaced convergent electron beams as used in the three-gun shadow-mask color kinescope, or in the one-gun shadow-mask tube. The entirely different deflection problem of a line-screen color tube, which uses a raster of precisely straight lines, is also considered, but in less detail. The shadow-mask color kinescope requires the beams to strike the same spot on the raster, regardless of which part of the deflecting field region is being traversed. A uniform magnetic deflecting field yields only approximately the desired result since large deflection angles and a plane screen complicate the problem. An experimental arrangement, for yoke design-timming, utilized a single-beam black-and-white or color kinescope with the electron-optics of the one-gun shadow-mask color tube. A rotating magnetic field near the gun produced a conical scan. The rotating beam was next passed through a convergence lens. With adjustable dc currents through the yoke, it was possible to study the convergence at each beam position as a closed pattern on the phosphor screen; a small spot was desired at all deflection positions. Test yokes were built with distributed winding sections, each shunted by a variable resistance to adjust its contributions to the deflecting field. The dc in the coil of the convergence lens was varied as a function of the radial deflection angle to yield best convergence over the entire raster. Adjustable magnetic \"compensating tabs\" at the forward end of the yoke aided in achieving a final best result."
"A number of improvements in band-shared simultaneous color systems (the previously proposed \"dot-sequential\" system being one of this class) are described. These improvements reduce susceptibility to interference and permit color pictures to be obtained through a total bandwidth of only 4 mc. These color pictures are comparable to those obtained with a nonband-shared simultaneous color system using 4-mc bandwidth for each color. In order to explain these system improvements the simultaneous nature of the so-called \"dot-sequential\" system must first be developed. Then the constant-luminance system, in which the color subearrier information does not affect the brightness of the picture, may be described. Additional improvements consist of an improved subcarrier pattern to reduce crawling effects in the picture and sampling of the brightness signal at the transmitter to reduce \"shimmer\" resulting from cross talk of high vbideo-frequency components into the chromaticity channel. The manner in which this group of system modifications can be used to improve substantially both compatibility and the color picture is explained."
"An additional improvement in band-shared simultaneous color systems is described which reduces the visibility of phase errors in the subcarrier channel of the system. This improvement is obtained by periodically reversing the phase sequence (timing order) of the color subcarrier information, for example, after each scanning field so that phase errors may produce opposite types of color errors on adjacent lines in space. At normal viewing distances the human eye averages the color of adjacent elemental areas, thus giving a first-order correction for chromaticity errors due to phase errors in the color subcarrier channel. While this permits a greater tolerance on the phase of the reinserted subcarrier at the receiver, the major advantage results because vestigial sideband transmission of the color subcarrier information is made practical. The manner in which this latter feature can be used to improve both compatibility and the reproduced color pictures is described. The extent to which the improvements of Part I can be used with a system having an oscillating color sequence is also discussed."
"A mathematical analysis of the pulse sampling and sorting processes is presented. Color distortion and cross talk introduced by sideband clipping of the sampled color functions is examined. A color multiplexing arrangement using cisoidal functions is described which can produce results equivalent to the pulse sampling and sorting method, and which is more economical circuitwise than pulse sampling. The use of mixed highs is reviewed and is shown to produce negligible effects on the color presentations, while providing resolution for the color picture equivalent to present monochrome standards in the same bandwidth."
"With the advent of commercial color television, the invitation of The Institute of Radio Engineers to present an up-to-date picture of the officially adopted system seemed most timely. This paper is divided into four sections. The first deals with the actual standards as established by the Federal Communications Commission and discusses their colorimetric significance. Section II discusses the design and performance of typical commercial color-television receivers. Section III will be of special interest to the broadcaster as it describes the conversion of existing black-and-white studio equipment for color-television use. Some data on studio installation and lighting are also furnished. Section IV deals with nonbroadcast uses of color television and describes industrial color-television equipment known under the name \"Vericolor.\" Other advances such as a method of increasing picture sharpness are presented in an accompanying paper (pp. 1314-1322) under the heading of \"A new technique for improving the sharpness of television pictures.\""
"In conjunction with the CBS color-television system a method has been developed for improving the apparent picture definition, called \"crispening.\" It uses nonlinear circuitry to decrease the apparent rise time of an isolated step input which is applied to a bandwidth limited system. This gives the color-television pictures (with the exception of repetitive patterns representing frequencies beyond system cutoff) the appearance of having been transmitted through a system of greater bandwidth. The basic idea is to add to a waveform with a slow transition a second waveform, representing the difference between the desired waveform and the original waveform. A simple circuit is described which utilizes nonlinear means for reforming the roughly triangular differential of the step signal into a narrower \"spike,\" roughly triangular in shape, which is superimposed on the original waveform to obtain a response corresponding to about half the original rise time. Various crispening circuits have been designed for specific applications and will be discussed in more detail. These crispening circuits can be applied to standard monochrome pictures. The resultant increase in sharpness, however, would be less apparent because of the law of diminishing returns. The doubling of the bandwidth, that is, halving of the rise time (which is the effect of crispening) will be less apparent in the already high-resolution monochrome pictures than in the lower resolution color pictures. Various subject matter and test patterns as photographed from the screen of color receivers are shown for 4."
"The frequency spectrum of the 6-mc channel, now standard in the United States for black-and-white- or monochrome-television transmissions, may be utilized in several ways for the transmission of color-television images. The three sets of data associated with color-television systems may be transmitted by time-division multiplex, by frequency-division multiplex, or by combinations of these two methods. One of the latter methods, called \"alternating lows,\" is discussed in some detail, and some of the working circuits for this method are presented."
"This paper presents results of tests to determine how much low-frequency interference can be tolerated in black-and-white television pictures. Various levels of single low-frequency interference were superimposed on a locally transmitted television picture. Observers viewed the picture and rated the disturbing effect of each level of the interference. Ratings were made in terms of preworded comments ranging from \"not perceptible\" to \"unusable.\" Interfering frequencies from 48 to 90 cycles per second were employed. Just visible interference appears as a flicker. The rate of flicker is the difference between interfering and 60-cycle field frequencies. The most disturbing interference produced a flicker rate of 5 or 6 cycles per second. To be tolerated, the peak-to-peak amplitude of this interference had to be 54 decibels weaker than the peak-to-peak amplitude of the television signal (including synchronizing pulse). For flicker rates of 0.5 and 12 cycles per second, the amount of interference which could be tolerated was larger by 14 and 3 decibels, respectively."

"Experience in selecting students for admission to undergraduate engineering colleges provides a clear outline for a program of tests and related procedures that should prove helpful in identifying potential engineering talent early in high school. Qualified students may then be guided toward adequate preparation for engineering training. Such a program would include the following as a basic minimum: the students' average grades, tests of mathematical aptitude, reading comprehension, spatial visualization, and interest inventories. A recently revised program of examinations are now available for selecting students for graduate study in engineering. Research is being undertaken which gives promise of the development, in the measurable future, of a means of detecting creative talent for scientific research."
"Secondary electron emission is of great importance to the physicist because of its bearing upon the problem of the interactions between fundamental particles and to the radio engineer because of its applications, as well as its effect, upon the operation of electronic tubes. A complete theoretical picture capable of accounting quantitatively for all observed phenomena does not exist. Secondary electron emission differs from other modes of emission in many respects. The essential characteristics can best be evaluated by considering a typical experimental arrangement for investigating the phenomenon. Three categories of emitted electrons are recognized. The yield may depend upon various factors, such as the primary energy, collector voltage, target temperature, time, angle of incidence, atomic properties of target, and the composition of the target. The difficulties of propounding a satisfactory theory are evident from an individual consideration of each of the various processes involved. The primary interaction, primary energy loss, escape of secondaries, and integration over the range of the primary must each be treated to arrive at a final solution. In several previous attempts at formulating a theory, only the most loosely bound electrons in the solid have been regarded as constituting the source of secondary electrons. Normalizations are required for comparison of the results with existing experimental data. There are cogent reasons for regarding bound electrons as a very important source of secondaries."
"Extended measurements are reported which indicate the existence of pronounced nocturnal superrefraction during an appreciable percentage of the summer and of very persistent scattering by atmospheric turbulence near the surface in all seasons. The measurements were taken over rolling midwestern terrain at a distance of about 100 miles. Mobile road tests were made to supplement the fixed-point measurements and to provide an approximate indication of the relation between field strength and distance. Aerial tests were made to show the effects of antenna height at large distance. Graphs are provided which show the effects of distance, terrain, antenna height, and time upon the field strength. The practical significance of the results in the broadcast and commmunication fields is indicated."
"This paper deals with the reduction of radio-propagation data. The primary aim is to present a clear picture of signalstrength variation with a minimum amount of computational work. A newly developed recording device is described and illustrated, together with an effective method of data analysis."
"This paper presents a procedure for measuring the dielectric properties of metal-loaded artificial dielectrics in the microwave region by the use of the short-circuited line method. Formulas, based on transmission-line theory, are included and serve as guides in predicting the approximate dielectric properties of certain loading configurations."
"The impedance of a two-terminal network is defined completely by the insertion loss and phase shift it produces when inserted between known sending and receiving impedances. Recent advances in precise wide-band phase and transmission measuring circuits have permitted practical use of this principle. Reactive and resistive impedance components are read directly from a simple graphical chart in which frequency is not a parameter. The basic principle described promises attractive possibilities in many cases of impedance measurements where present methods are inadequate."
"Speech-reinforcement systems in six large auditoriums were evaluated, using subjective rating tests, word-articulation tests, and, in two cases, a new test method. This method, called the \"terminal-word test,\" makes possible the quantitative measurement of speech intelligibility for a sound system in actual use. A graphical method is presented for calculating the performance of a sound system in which account is taken of the frequency response of the system, the reverberation time of the room, the directivity index of the loudspeaker, and the room noise. Test results indicate that a flat frequency response in the range between 400 and 4,000 cps is required for good intelligibility. The graphical method indicates that little further increase in intelligibility would result from extending this range upward or downward. If the loudspeaker system is sufficiently directive in this frequency range and properly located in the room, room reverberation has little effect on speech intelligibility."
"A general formula for the radiation resistance of a two-wire line is derived by means of a Poynting vector integration over a large sphere. The result is shown to be in agreement with that computed by other techniques. Formulas for the useful special cases of a lossless system and a nonresonant line are presented."
"A storage system which will store binary (on or off) pulses has been constructed, and should prove useful in laboratory studies of certain communication problems. The system comprises two storage channels, each utilizing an MIT electrostatic storage tube and switching circuits which route incoming pulses into one channel while stored pulses are being recovered from the other. Pulses are stored in each tube in a square array of discrete spots of charge; each spot may assume one of two possible potentials, corresponding to the two possible states of a binary pulse. The order of occurrence of incoming pulses is preserved during storage, but the time relationship is not; the time relationship of pulses recovered from storage is determined by an independent pulse source under control of the user. Consequently, the system may be used to compress, expand, or delay a group of pulses. The capacity of each storage channel is, at present, 256 pulses. The system operates reliably at all frequencies up to 33 kc when storing incoming pulses and up to 70 kc when supplying stored pulses."
"In this paper it is shown how the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of an aperture may be determined accurately by electrolytic-analog measurements. Measured magnetic-polarizability data are given for rectangular-, rounded-slot-, cross-, rosette-, dumbbell-, and H-shaped apertures."
"The ancient idea of a combination coarse and fine adjustment is shown to be applicable to the design of precision automatic control systems. In the particular class of systems discussed, the coarse adjustment is taken to be a separate element operated by the input, but outside the feedback loop. Its position outside the feedback loop qualifies the coarse controller as an open-cycle system, and makes it possible to introduce such elements without affecting the system's transient response adversely. In this way, interference equalization of dynamical distortion errors is possible without such critical dependence being placed on a knowledge of series elements of the system as is required for interference equalization by a controller in the feedback loop. Three broad types of open-cycle systems are discussed: series, parallel, and partially parallel. Each of these may be \"algebraic,\" \"differential,\" or a combination. The algebraic controllers are useful when the average value of the input signal is predictable-particularly where a repetitive duty cycle is encountered. The advantages of adding completely parallel open-cycle elements for improving speed range and reducing over-all cost are shown. Idea is also applicable to nonlinear and multiplicoupled systems."
"A method of analyzing the response of automatic frequency-control systems, operating in conjunction with a narrow band-pass filter, is presented in this paper. A time-lag, equivalent to the reciprocal of the bandwidth, is assigned to the filter. Circuit parameters are established for operation near the critically damped response condition. The equations of the system are derived with the aid of the Laplace transform. The method of residues is used to evaluate the transient response to a step-input frequency disturbance."
"High-frequency model studies are reported which promise an antenna which operates over a 4-to-1 frequency range with a maximum power loss, due to mismatch, of 18.5 per cent. In the projected naval application, this loss is not unusual with currently used antenna systems. The antenna consists of an ordinary fan-type antenna folded back to ground, that is, electrically connected at the top to an identical fan grounded at its base. A means is described for matching the antenna to 52-ohm transmission line, although the folded structures center at about 160 ohms. The model described in detail is not necessarily of absolutely optimum proportions. The maximum variation with azimuth of the radiation intensity of the antenna is less than 10 db. In the vertical plane, the antenna illuminates the horizon adequately, wasting no appreciable portion of the energy on the zenith."
"This paper describes a method for eliminating the feed-cable effect in the measurement of aircraft wing-cap and tail-cap antenna impedances with the aid of models. The procedure employed allows greater accuracy in measurement than that obtainable with conventional techniques, but its application is restricted to use use on simplified models. The advantages and limitations of the method are discussed, and typical experimental results are presented."
"A simple method of \"tuning up\" a multiple-resonant-circuit filter quickly and exactly is demonstrated. The method may be summarized as follows: Very loosely couple a detector to the first resonator of the filter; then, proceeding in consecutive order, tune all odd-numbered resonators for maximum detector output, and all even-numbered resonators for minimum detector output (always making sure that the resonator immediately following the one to be resonated is completely detuned). Also considered is the correct adjustment of the two other types of constants in a filter. Filter constants can always be reduced to only three fundamental types: f0, dr(1/Qr), and Kr(r+1). This is true whether a lumped-element 100-kc filter or a distributed-element 5,000-mc unit is being considered. dr is adjusted by considering the rth resonator as a single-tuned circuit (all other resonators completely detuned) and setting the bandwidth between the 3-db-down-points to the required value. Kr(r+1) is adjusted by considering the rth and (r+1)th adjacent resonators as a double-tuned circuit (all other resonators completely detuned) and setting the bandwidth between the resulting response peaks to the required value. Finally, all the required values for K and Q are given for an n-resonant-circuit filter that will produce the response (Vp/V)2=1 +(Δf/Δf3db)2n."
"Energy from a remote transmitter excites a receiving antenna that is erected vertically over a large conducting plane and base-loaded by a vertical slotted coaxial cavity of variable length. From measurements of the location and half-power width of resonance curves, the combined phase and damping factors for the two ends of the cavity are determined. By measuring these factors for the lower end of the cavity separately, those of the upper end are determined and used to calculate the impedance of the antenna. In effect, the receiving antenna is the generator driving the coaxial line, and it is the impedance of this generator that is measured. Curves of the measured impedance as a function of the electrical length of the antenna are given. Excellent agreement is obtained between impedances measured in this manner for the receiving antenna and corresponding impedances of the same antenna when base-driven through the slotted section. Both sets of measurements are in good agreement with the King-Middleton second-order theory."

"This paper cites that in the rapid growth of electronics engineering, management has not always appreciated the full magnitude of the \"systems engineering\" problem. In setting forth what alert management should attempt to accomplish, the systems engineering influence in research and development is discussed in some detail. In this regard particularly is it significant that more care must be given to the planning of features that make for simpler maintenance in large complicated systems. Installation problems are dealt with briefly and particular emphasis is given to the noise reduction problem within the systems in order that the best optimum repeatable results are obtained. Finally, the engineering management phases are treated from the stand-point of management assuming greater responsibility to see that increased engineering emphasis is given to proper maintenance of installed systems."
"A phenomenological description of high-frequency gas-discharge breakdown is given, describing the similarities and differences between these discharges and the more familiar dc type. High-frequency discharge breakdown is controlled by the process of electron diffusion and, besides the theory of its behavior, the physical limitations of tube size, gas pressure, and frequency for this type of breakdown are given. The particular case of hydrogen is cited. The effects of superimposing a small dc field and a magnetic field on the ac field are also discussed."
"The place of simulation in system design is developed in relation to all other steps in the design process. From this, the relation of simulation to both the analytical attack, on the one hand, and to a final operational system, on the other, is developed. This leads naturally to the program to be followed in a simulation setup. In this discussion the pitfalls to be avoided are emphasized. Then simulation of a human link in a system is discussed. Finally, a critique of simulation is given with relation to cost, time, difficulty of execution, treatment of nonlinearities, and noisy inputs."
"This report describes the development of a vhf-omnirange system, operating in the frequency band of 112 and 118 mc. The range furnishes magnetic-bearing information with respect to the range station, and provides definite track guidance between the station and any point within its service area. The omnirange produces two 30-cps signals: one is constant in phase and independent of the aircraft's position, and the other varies in relative phase directly in accordance with the magnetic bearing of the aircraft from the station. A phase-measuring device in the receiver enables the pilot to determine his magnetic bearing with respect to the station, and to select and fly a range course on any desired magnetic bearing. The accuracy of the system, including the receiver plus ground equipment, in operation at the Civil Aeronautics Administration Experimental Station, Indianapolis, Indiana, is approximately 1.5 degrees. The ground equipment has been in continuous operation for more than 3 years. The vhf omnirange has been selected as part of the common Civil-Military System, Transition Program, as recommended by the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics."
"The paper deals with the problem, frequently encountered in radar, of extracting simple numerical information from a noisy waveform. It is suggested that the only ideal way of doing this is to use the principle of inverse probability and convert the wave-form into a probability distribution for the quantity sought. The method is applied to the problem of determining the time delay of a periodically modulated rf waveform in the presence of white Gaussian noise when the undelayed waveform without noise is exactly known. As a result, the matched predetection filter of Van Vleck and Middleton is automatically specified, and the theory of ideal detection is briefly indicated."
"The paper describes the basic principles involved in an operating system of rf repeaters, and discusses the planning and installation of this system in Cuba. It mentions the types of antennas used and briefly describes the physical layout of the equipment involved. Also included is a resme of the difficulties that arose and how they were overcome."
"A new direction finder for cm waves has been developed which indicates the wave direction by the minimum response of a dipole placed at the focus of a small paraboloidal reflector. It works well irrespective of whether the polarization of the waves is horizontal or vertical. A new flow meter has also been developed which indicates directly the active power flow of the waves, in magnitude and direction. It will serve most effectively in the study of wave diffraction. With an ordinary mirror galvanometer the author has succeeded in measuring the energy flow of 1 μw per cm2 at the wavelength of 10 cm."
"A simple locked-oscillator frequency divider is described. The circuit, which consists of an LC oscillator modified to facilitate locking, is capable of operating over a 7-to-1 plate-supply-voltage range when dividing by a factor of 30."
"This paper describes a method of determining the source of the long-distance backscatter and the results obtained using this method at frequencies of 9, 12, 16, and 22 mc."
"Under the assumption of absolute vacuum in a tetrode, the space-charge depression in the screen-grid anode region will at sufficiently high current prevent secondary electrons released at the anode from reaching the grid, thus making the anode-current, anode-voltage characteristic similar to that of a pentode. Under pressure conditions present in ordinary high-vacuum tubes, positive ions formed by collisions between electrons and residual gas molecules will be trapped in the potential trough between the screen grid and the anode. Provided there exists no transverse ion-sweeping fields from beam-forming plates (as in the beam-power tetrode) or from charged end insulators, ion trapping proceeds automatically until the electron charge is neutralized. The effects of ion-trapping are discussed and a pulse method is described for measuring the conditions with and without presence of ions and for studying the ion-buildup process. Plasma ion oscillations have been observed."
"Space charge in reflex tubes has an effect which causes considerable departure from the existing reflex theory. To a first order, it modifies the electronic admittance by a bunching effectiveness parameter, designated F, which, in general, takes some value between one and three. Several approximate methods have been used to estimate this F factor and the results are presented graphically for comparison with experimental measurements on the 723A/B reflex tube, showing good first-order agreement."
"This paper describes an instrument for generating any polynomial and for finding the roots of any polynomial equation to any desired degree of accuracy."

"The growth of The Institute of Radio Engineers has depended in large measure on the energy and enterprise and upon the flexibility with which the Institute welcomed changes that improved its operations. Originally the activities of the Institute were concentrated in one city. Then came the great change of establishing many Sections, one after another. Years later the Regions were built up, thus forming an even larger, more democratic, and more effective Institute. Still more recently the Professional Groups were established, thus enabling members interested in any particular field to find full opportunity for conferences and publication. This opened up a new and even greater era for Institute activities and expansion. This Euest Editorial ably deals with this latest policy development in Institute affairs. It was written by a former Chairman of the Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Section of the IRE, the head ot the Hunter Manufacturing Company in Iowa City, who has also been a member of the Policy Development Committee and of the Board of Directors"
"Polycasting is a method applicable to very-high-frequency and ultra-high-frequency bands for broadcasting a program from a number of low-powered stations instead of from a single high-powered one with the object of covering a continuous area. It may be regarded as a special application of satellite operation, making use of the fact that at high frequencies the signal intensity varies over a wide range from point to point so that the service must be evaluated on a statistical basis. The paper is a theoretical study of the service obtainable. It is shown that to provide a large percentage of the locations in an area with good service requires far more power from a single station than from several stations. This effective power gain is over and above the simple gain from better \"illumination\" of a large area when served by several sources instead of concentrating all the power at one point. A special application of the system to serve rural areas is explained. It is there proposed to locate the component stations of the polycasting system in small towns, so located that a rural grade of service is provided by them in the area between them. Estimates of service are given, taking into account ghosts and signal intensity required to overcome noise. There is also laid out tentative allocation of stations in two typical areas"
"Shockley, Sparks, and Teal have recently described the physical properties of a new kind of transistor. Preliminary studies of circuit performance show that it is a stable, high-gain, quiet amplifier of considerable practical interest. This papet analyzes the performance of a few early experimental units."
"It has recently been discovered that it is possible to reduce skin effect losses in transmission Iines by properly laminating the conductors and adjusting the velocity of transmission of the waves. The theory for such laminated transmission lines is presented in the case of planar systems for both infinitesimally thin laminae and laminae of finite thickness. A transmission line completely filled with lamimated material is discussed. An analysis is given of the modes of transmission in a laminated line, and of the problem of terminating such a line."
"A crystal discriminator employing only one quartz crystal and very simple in adjustment is described in detail. The stability of center frequency determination in the presence of frequency modulation and variation of component values is calculated in terms of the circuit parameters, and is shown to be adequate for the requirements of broadcast transmitters. Experimental measurements confirm the results of the theoretical analysis. The discriminator was designed for use in a television aural transmitter, and a brief description is given of the complete FM exciter unit."
"A survey is presented covering the metallurgical problems and manufacturing methods used in the refining and melting of nickel, and its fabrication into indirectly heated cathode sleeves for electron tubes. The important role of minor constituent alloys is discussed from both the metallurgical and electronic points of view. Four of the most important cathode performance characteristics are defined and the effect of base-metal composition on each one is discussed. The influences of each important element present in cathode nickel alloys are enumerated. Suggestions are made concerning present and future developmental cathode materials to meet new and more severe demands being placed upon electron tubes."
"A plane-electrode triode is described which may be operated as a grounded-grid amplifier to obtain 1.5 kw at frequencies up to 700 mc. It operates with 3,000 volts on the plate, is water cooled and has an oxide-coated equipotential cathode. The grid is of an unusual design, made of copper and is nonemitting. The performance at 500 mc is 1.5-kw output, apparent efficiency 55 per cent, power gain 6.5 times."
"A receiver with a logarithmic input-output law can be used with advantage on radar equipment, but it has hitherto been difficult to obtain such a law without the addition of a considerable number of tubes. One system by which such a law can be obtained is described and a circuit is given which shows how the method may be simplified to produce a receiver which can be either logarithmic or linear by the operation of a single switch. A method of predicting the shape of the input-output curve of such a receiver is described. The measured input-output curves for three logarithmic receivers of this simplified type are shown and the relevant circuit values specified. Some design notes are added. A note on the use of the logarithmic receiver as an anticlutter device is followed by consideration of the display of signals from a logarithmic receiver, and a brief discussion on bandwidth variations."
"The problem of azimuthal resolution in radar systems is discussed. It is shown how the resolution is related to the antenna beamwidth and thus in turn to the size of aperture. The possibilities of improving resolution beyond the normal capabilities is considered and the limitations are presented from two aspects. The first aspect is concerned with the attempt to build a \"supergain\" antenna. The second aspect is concerned with the attempt to achieve a similar result through the utilization of filter equalization techniques. It is shown that no essential improvement in resolution appears to be obtainable in a practical manner."
"A bridged-T network previously employed for the measurement of resistance is analyzed, and is shown to be useful as the frequency-determining element of a resistance-tuned oscillator. The resistance-capacitance form of the network permits a wide tuning range and simple switching between ranges, while the resistance-inductance network suggests the possibility of building an oscillator having decade frequency dials. With both forms of the network a moderate value of equivalent Q can be obtained, which is desirable for accuracy and stability of frequency calibration."
"This microwave delay lens medium is shown to have both magnetic and electric anisotropy, which necessitates an analysis describing its refractive properties for obliquely incident waves. A simple linear transformation is applied to the field equations such that the transformed system is magnetically isotropic, Classical solutions from studies in optics provide the ray velocity surfaces in that system. An inverse transformation yields the ray velocity surfaces in the original medium. Huyghens construction is employed, for two particular arrays, to determine the refracted wave direction after oblique incidence."
"The properties possessed in common by biconjugate networks are derived. It is shown that all biconjugate networks possess the following properties: (1) Of the six possible transfer impedances only three are independent, one of them being infinite; (2) The magnitudes of the reflection coefficients at each resistance are equal; (3) The phase angles of the transfer impedances are not independent but must satisfy equation (4) of the text. It is shown that biconjugate networks can be divided into two classes depending upon the phase relationship existing between pairs of transfer impedances. One class of networks is such that the responses to two driving voltages consist of one output proportional to the sum of the driving voltage and of one output proportional to the difference of the driving voltages. Waveguide networks, such as hybrid circles, magic tees, and directional couplers, are examples of quasi-biconjugate networks. The 7/2-λg hybrid circle is analyzed in detail. Computations yielding all the driving-point and transfer impedances have been made. The results are plotted. Two quantities measuring the deviation of the 7/2-λg hybrid circle from the ideal behavior are defined and evaluated. One of these quantities measures the cross coupling between pairs of quasi-conjugate arms. The other quantity measures the degree to which the network fails to take sums and differences."
"This paper illustrates the fact that three-terminal passive resistor-capacitor networks are capable of having unity voltage gain at zero frequency and higher than unity gain over a prescribed frequency band. A general design procedure for synthesizing a transfer function with these properties using, insofar as possible, known methods of synthesis is outlined. Together with suggestions for further work, two examples are presented to illustrate the method."

"Experimental public radio-telephone service for train passengers was inaugurated by the Bell Telephone System several years ago. Initial installations operated in conjunction with a series of urban mobile base stations. More recently, highway mobile systems have been used for this service, and this paper describes a typical train installation operating through a highway channel. All of these early systems utilized an attendant on the train. The cost of providing an attendant has, in some cases, been found excessive. Consequently, experiments have been initiated in which a coin box is used on the train. The arrangements for this purpose are also described."
"A bridge-type RC oscillator is described which is continuously adjustable over a frequency range of 20 cps to 3 mc in one sweep of a two-gang linear potentiometer control. Tracking requirements of the two-gang control are not severe. The output is available in four phases, and the frequency is an approximately logarithmic function of the linear potentiometer setting. Practical limits of the frequency range are tentatively 0.01 cps and 10 mc. Accuracy of setting of the order of one per cent is attainable with ordinary components. Frequency stability is of the order of 2 per cent per db of tube gain variation."
"An analysis of the magnetic tape recording process employing supersonic excitation is presented by considering the effect of the spatial distribution of the magnetic field around the recording head air gap on the magnetic history of an unmagnetized element of tape as it tracks across the recording head. This leads to an effect which is termed \"recording demagnetization\" and serves to explain certain performance characteristics. An experimental technique developed for the measurement of this recording demagnetization is described, as is the method of measuring the air-gap field distribution. Finally, the correlation of the measurements of the recording demagnetization with normal recording performance characteristics is reported."
"The charging process in cathode-ray tubes used for static storage of information is analyzed for both a stationary spot and a linear scan, with and without redistribution of secondary electrons. Approximate equations are derived for the surface potentials and charging current as functions of time and other parameters, such as primary beam current, writing speed, and initial potentials. The results are presented graphically in special cases for comparison with photographs of experimental wave forms."
"The positive column of an electrical discharge through argon it utilized as a source of random fluctuations to provide a standard noise source for microwave frequencies. It is shown that the waveguide may be matched to the discharge with very low reflection over the entire recommended transmission bandwidth of the waveguide without the utilization of tuned elements. Further, when the discharge is not excited, microwave transmission through the guide is possible with very low reflection. The noise temperature is about 15.5 db above 290° K. Performance data are given for frequencies between 2,600 and 26,000 mc per second. The effect of varying the discharge parameters, geometry, gas, gas pressure and current, upon both the radio-frequency and noise performance is discussed. The factors affecting the occurrence of low-frequency fluctuations in the discharge are considered and the proper operating conditions to avoid their effects on the microwave performance are given. The hypothesis that the noise temperature corresponds to the electron temperature of the positive column is presented and supporting evidence is offered."
"Essential information for calculation of traveling-wave-tube gain is summarized and condensed in this paper. The important relations are documented, presented in a concise form for simplified computation, and developed as a nomograph. The conclusions have been found to be in agreement with measurements on six different tube designs."
"After a discussion of gain, noise factor and attenuation in conventional traveling-wave tubes (twt), a dispersive twt is described and experimental results given. Examination of results and theory lead to the recognition of several types of partition noise as the cause of much of the noise in traveling-wave tubes. These are analyzed and approximate expressions for their magnitude are obtained. Noise due to electron-wave type amplification and thermal noise originating in the resistive part of the helix are also discussed. Experiments are described."
"The basic techniques of microwave power measurement are discussed, together with principles of self-balancing bridges for that application. A method of measuring the power change by means of a nonlinear \"slave\" bridge is presented. Temperature compensation problems are discussed as applied to the meter under consideration. The complete power meter is considered along with operating procedure."
"A method for the experimental determination of the distribution of radio-frequency current on the metal surface of an aircraft mounting a transmitting antenna is described. Plots of the amplitude and phase of the current excited on various types of air frames by typical medium-high-frequency antennas are presented and compared qualitatively with the results obtained from quasi-static arguments."
"Universal curves of the reciprocal of the complex response function are studied for systems with one or two tuned circuits. The normalized parabola for two circuits is presented with a net of loci for the origin of co-ordinates within it. The ratio Q1/Q2, the amount of fixed detuning, the amount of coupling, and amplitude and phase of any additional feedback independently displace the origin with respect to its position in case of two identical, uncoupled circuits without feedback. Complex cases may be easily analyzed. Different methods incorporating regeneration or feedback loops are discussed which allow practical bandwidth control within wide limits."
"The simultaneous presence of oscillations locked in synchronism is investigated for circuits containing a nonlinear element. Under these conditions the circuit is called internally resonant, the two frequencies of oscillation being related by an integral ratio r/s. The discussion is confined to self-excitation in a highly oscillatory circuit connected across a nonlinear element. Nonlinear oscillations are generally characterized by a certain Fourier spectrum of the component frequencies; as a first approximation, it is reasonable to assume that only the fundamental components need be considered. The nonlinear element is described in terms of its current voltage characteristic and an equivalent linearized parameter defined by considering only the two fundamental frequencies. The variation-of-parameters method is applied to the resultant \"linearized\" equations and the equilibrium conditions determined. The conditions for stable equilibrium are then investigated by assuming a small departure from the equilibrium and studying the motion of the system following this displacement."
"A series of experiments were conducted to determine the properties of single-surface corrugated structures as transmission lines and as radiators. Two types of surfaces were tested: the first is a flat grooved plate fed by a waveguide; the second, a circular, corrugated cylinder fed by a coaxial line. A modification of the second type results in a spirally grooved rod with similar properties. The measured field parameters are found to be predictable from existing theory. For properly designed structures the energy is essentially bound to the corrugated surface; little radiation occurs, and the attenuation of the traveling wave is due chiefly to losses in the metal. The effect of filling the corrugations with solid dielectric is also analyzed."
"The radial transmission line theory provides a rigorous description of the propagation of electromagnetic energy in certain cylindrical regions. The complexity of direct calculation may be avoided by a simpler, although approximate, description based on the asymptotic identity of radial and uniform transmission line formulas at large radii. Approximate expressions are developed for input admittance, frequency sensitivity, and higher mode interaction effects on radial lines. Estimates of the order of accuracy are included, and applications are made to sectoral horns."

"The need for reliability in electron-tube operation has increased several fold during the past few years and has far outdistanced corresponding quality-evaluation methods. Not only has this been evidenced by requirements in civilian applications, but also, and even more important, in military fields where several thousand tubes may be needed in a single piece of equipment. In an attempt to overcome the deficiency in present evaluation methods an entirely new approach is offered-that of analyzing and specifying tube-population mortality rates and tube-population characteristic depreciation rates. This concept shifts the emphasis from the individual to the group, and is more susceptible to scientific treatment and evaluation."
"This paper is written for the engineer or student who has some general knowledge of feedback and who wishes to acquaint himself with the basic problem underlying the design of feedback amplifiers. The concept of complex frequency is introduced as a necessary background for the discussion of the stability problem. The criterion for stability is formulated in terms of fundmental restrictions on amplifier behavior at complex frequencies. From this a simplified criterion placing equivalent restrictions on the behavior at real frequencies leads directly to Nyquist's criterion. The role played by the theory of functions of a complex variable is indicated, but a knowledge of the theory is not required. A survey of certain important relations between gain and phase-shift in minimum phase-shift networks provides the preparation needed for the concluding discussion of the principles by which stability is effected."
"A self-saturable magnetic amplifier circuit element consisting of a reactor winding in series with a dry-disc rectifier, a resistive load and an ac voltage source is described and analyzed with respect to its operation and design. The results are in the form of curves from which optimum values of power and load resistance can be obtained as a function of the magnetic properties of the core material and the characteristics of the rectifier elements. These curves are used to obtain the best practical design values for complete amplifiers. Several magnetic amplifiers made up of a combination of the basic circuit elements are described in this paper with respect to their use as multistage amplifiers in servomechanisms and other applications."
"Amplitude and phase measurements have been made of the mechanical motion of different points on the cone diaphragm for various critical frequencies. From these the cause of various peaks and dips in the sound-pressure curve can be determined. Such information is helpful when making changes to improve the cone design."
"This paper presents general design data for a complete radio relay transmission system. All parameters are shown in graphs either as gain or attenuation figures (decibels). From these figures, either a level diagram may be plotted or the final signal-tonoise ratio may be obtained by simple addition or subtraction of the respective parameters. In order to get realistic figures for various modulation systems, a new parameter has been defined which accounts for the deficiency of the demodulator. Numerical examples are presented to show the convenience in practical use."
"This paper describes a traveling-wave amplifier in which the electron beam interacts with a spatial harmonic of an electromagnetic wave propagating along an array of resonator slots. The result is a considerable reduction in operating beam voltage for a given physical separation of the circuit elements. This type of amplifier operating at about 1,200 volts has yielded net power gains of about 18 db in the 6-mm wavelength region. A magnetic field of about 1,600 gauss is sufficient for proper beam focusing. Aside from small variations of gain with frequency caused by internal reflections, the bandwidth is of the order of 3 per cent."
"The theory of interaction between coupled transmission lines moving relative to each other is developed, and conditions yielding waves increasing exponentially with distance (amplification) are found. The case of lossless lines, one moving and one stationary, is analyzed in considerable detail, and the results are shown to be applicable to the helix traveling-wave tube. The theory also suggests the possibility of traveling-wave amplification in systems other than electrical, and a mechanical traveling-wave oscillator has been built."
"In some modem high-speed electronic computers the reference is time. This paper is concerned with the time-reference equipment designed for the EDVAC. The application of electronic matrices to time-pulse production is discussed."
"Heretofore, tunable waveguide filters have consisted of cavities connected with quarter-wavelength coupling lines and tuned by means of a lumped reactance in the cavity. Such filters exhibit asymmetrical frequency response and a bandwidth proportional to the cube of frequency when tuned. A different method of tuning is to maintain constant guide wavelength as the filter is tuned. A filter so tuned will exhibit symmetrical pass-band response and essentially constant bandwidth. Various methods of varying guide wavelength are investigated, including (1) changing the guide width, (2) inserting a dielectric strip in the broad face of the guide, and (3) inserting a metal strip in the broad face of the guide. Measurements on a three-section filter tuned by a dielectric strip show that almost constant bandwidth with a straight-line frequency tuning curve can be obtained over at least a 12 per cent frequency range."
"In this paper there is developed an approximate treatment of narrow-band triode noise factor, taking into account induced grid noise by a new method. Minimal values of noise factor predicted theoretically are compared with experimental values, and it is found that from a knowledge of circuit losses, shot noise, mutual conductance, space charge input capacitance, and dc grid current measured on the tube, noise factor, and optimum source conductance can be predicted with accuracy over a wide range of operating conditions. It is shown that lead inductance effects and normal induced grid effects (grid noise, space-charge capacitance, transit-time damping) have no influence on noise performance, but merely affect tube admittances. Direct compensation in the grid circuit of components of input admittance to which these effects give rise leads to a deterioration of noise factor usually attributed to grid noise. It is shown that the optimum grid circuit detuning may be provided automatically by the input space-charge capacitance."
"The transient properties of asymmetrical amplitude-modulated carrier systems are studied in the time domain. A vector integral method is given for the determination of system response to arbitrary modulation. Typical nonlinearity of the envelope transfer function is studied as a function of modulation depth. It is found that the time delay associated with a rising response to a step change is always less than the delay associated with a decreasing response to a similar change. Transient improvement as a consequence of detuning in asymmetrical systems appears to be accompanied by a decrease in signalto-noise ratio."
"Sound portrayal techniques used in studies of speech and noise reveal the structure of atmospheric disturbances well known to long-wave radio and ocean-cable engineers as \"whistlers,\" \"swishes,\" and \"tweeks.\" It is suggested that renewed investigation of these effects, using modern analyzing tools, might yield information of considerable scientific interest."
"A method is offered for the exact realization with a ladder network containing only resistors and capacitors of a transfer ratio subject to the following three conditions: 1. Poles of H(p) occur at real, negative values of p and are simple. 2. Zeros of H(p) occur at real, negative values of p, but may be multiple. 3. H(p) is fnite for p = jω, -∞ ≦ ω ≦ ∞. This type of network frequently has gain factors considerably greater than that allowed for an equivalent network synthesized on the lattice basis."
"Simple approximate formulas are derived for the horizontal and vertical patterns of directional arrays of dipoles arranged on an arc of a circle or on the surface of a right circular cylindrical segment and backed by a reflecting cylinder. The dipoles may be aligned axially or circumferentially and the amplitude distribution on them may be uniform or cosinusoidal. The results are valid in the vicinity of the radiation maximum, but are less certain at wide angles unless the dipole spacing is substantially less than a half wavelength. It is found that the array patterns compare favorably with those of linear arrays of comparable dimensions and similar amplitude distributions, and that there exists, in certain cases, an increase in gain over the linear array brought about by the end-fire effect inherent in the geometry of the circle."
"Numerical calculations have been made for linear broadside super-gain arrays. Using arrays having an over-all length of a quarter wavelength as an example, it is shown that as the required directive gain is increased, tremendous currents are required to produce only a small radiated field. For a 9-element array which produces a power gain of 8.5, the currents must be adjusted to their correct value to an accuracy of better than 1 part in 1011. The efficiency is less than 10-14 per cent."
"By using a special electrode form or a special field distribution, overtones in lengthwise vibrating crystal plates or bars can be suppressed to any amount."
"Evaluation of the Fourier integral by parts leads to two different series representations of a time function in the frequency domain. These series involve powers of the frequency variable and either derivatives or integrals of the function, evaluated at the upper time limit only. It is necessary that the function so treated be analytic between the time limits imposed. The convenience of the formulation then follows from choosing the time limits symmetrically. The method is presented as a mathematical experiment rather than a rigorous formulation."
"A design procedure is described by which a coaxial transmission line tuning stub may be designed for minimum energy dissipation when the input susceptance or reactance is specified. The problem has been formulated for air dielectric only where dielectric losses are ordinarily small compared to copper losses. The results are presented in curve form."
"In the paper entitled \"Application of correlation analysis to the detection of periodic signals in noise,\" by Y.W. Lee, T.P. Cheatham, Jr., and J.B. Wiesner (ibid., vol. 38, pp 1165-1171; Oct, 1950), several controvertible statements appeared. Because of the importance of this subject and the consequent possibility that the reader might easily arrive at erroneous conclusions, the commenting authors feel that these several statements should be amplified. In replying the original authors note the comments but fail to see that the statements concerned are incorrect or \"controvertible.\" The commentors reply that they agree with the description of the special filter of North and Van Vleck and Middleton, but cannot follow the distinction which is made between this filter and a conventional filter in the penultimate paragraph of the reply. The original authors then note that these discussions primarily concern two statements of ours (as quoted in their reply) which Marchand, Leifer, and Holloway claim to be the \"several controvertible statements\" appearing in the paper. The validity of the first statement is not challenged after the reply. The original authors concludede, therefore, that it is not controvertible. With respect to the second statement, Marchand, Leifer, and Holloway do not disagree that the conventional filter described in the penultimate paragraph of our reply will theoretically achieve as much as a correlator in signal-to-noise ratio improvement. However, they do not follow the distinction between this filter and the North filter. The authors believe that the distinction between them has been made clear in their reply."

"The largest 60-cycle transformer core ever made now is in successful operation on a 300,000,000-volt betatron. If this core were used for an oil immersed power transformer, windings for continuous operation at 2,000,000 kva could be placed on it. Construction of this core is a demonstration of the feasibility of constructing transformers many times as large as those now being built. The advantages of larger transformers are lower cost per kilovolt-ampere and less loss per kilovolt-ampere transformed resulting in higher efficiency. The present limitation in the size of transformers is shipping clearances. When transformers larger than those which can be shipped are needed, they can be constructed by assembling them in the field using construction and methods similar to those employed for this large core."
"Requirements for disconnecting switches to operate when ice-coated demand special attention to details of design and to methods of testing the performance of a given design. In order for an ice test to provide a true criterion of the performance of a design, the icing program must be preceded by a wetting period above freezing temperatures, the simulated rain must be uniform over the test area, and the volume of water must be in balance with the ambient temperature in order to permit continuous wetting of the surfaces upon which ice is forming. Operation tests should be made at 20 degrees Fahrenheit and adequate time should be allowed after ending the spraying to equalize the masses of ice and metal at this temperature. Based upon the observed results of almost 100 individual ice tests, it is found that rounded contours, generous clearances, dry sealed bearings, small radii of all rotating members, sealed and enclosed hinge contacts, high-pressure line contacts, optimum clearance at linkage points, and absence of compression points are all required to maximize the ability of a disconnecting switch to be operated when coated with ice."
"An analytical method for computing the stress at any point in the impregnated paper insulation of high voltage power cables is developed. The method is extended to the evaluation of both radial and tangential stresses, and to those arising in graded cables. The limitations in the use of high density paper are explained."
"The self-geometric mean distance of a symmetrical angle-shaped conductor is approximately 0.393 times the width of the flange of the conductor, measured on the outer surface. The geometric mean distance between two symmetrical angular conductors, when arranged as shown in Figure 5, is very nearly equal to the distance between corresponding points on the two conductors, even for spacings approaching zero. Formulas are developed for the geometric self mean distance of an unsymmetrical angular conductor, and the geometric mean distance between two such conductors (equations 15 and 21 respectively)."
"This paper presents the application and beneficial results of protecting existing transmission lines which traverse mountainous country against direct lightning strokes by redesign of towers, alteration of overhead ground wires, installation of high speed relaying, and lowering of tower footing resistance by buried counterpoise wires."
"The problem of commutation has always been one of the most important problems in the satisfactory operation of both d-c and a-c commutator motors. The universal motor has the problems of both a-c and d-c motors. The many factors influencing satisfactory commutation such as electrical and magnetic conditions, mechanical condition of the armature, carbon brush condition, and in some applications such as portable electrical tools, atmospheric conditions may be such as to influence commutations. In both the d-c and a-c motors, the armature conductors cutting across the magnetic field set up by the combined armature and field winding generate electromotive forces in the short-circuited coils which are proportional to the product of the speed of the armature, the flux which the armature conductors cut, and the number of turns in series. However, in the a-c motor, there is a voltage generated by the reversals of the main field flux just as the voltage is generated in the secondary of a transformer. In the noncompensated motor, commutation can be somewhat improved by using a strong main field and weak armature field and moving the brushes backward. However, this has no effect upon the transformer voltage. In the compensated universal motor there is a compensating winding distributed at 90 electrical degrees to the main field and opposing the armature field, or in the single fied distributed winding the brushes are moved back a predetermined amount which compensates for the voltage due to the armature field."
"During the past few years there has been a trend toward the use of statistics of forced (unscheduled) generator outages as a basis for calculating the proper amount of stand-by reserve generation for a given power system. This paper presents a method of analysis which was developed to fit the needs of a system having a large number of generators, but which, it is believed, can be used to advantage for small systems also. The method is based partially on previously published results.1,2,3 This method lends itself readily to calculations, involves few approximations, and has sufficient flexibility to take account of several types of machines having different outage factors. Although the discussion is confined to generator outages, the method of analysis here presented may be used for calculation of simultaneous overlap of events of other types for which corresponding assumptions can be made. Examples are random outages of transmission lines and other types of equipment, random use of parallel communication channels, and supply of current to a number of items of equipment, each having a random duty cycle. The method is applicable to any situation which can be represented on a graph similar to Figure 1(A), provided that necessary statistical data are available."
"Power air circuit breakers cannot be closed safely on energized circuits by direct manual operation because the force and speed required may, in the case of fault current, exceed the strength of the operator. But in some small installations, manual operation is very desirable. A device is here described, which stores manual work in a spring in easy increments and, when released, closes the circuit breaker with proper speed and power."
"A new air-blast circuit breaker rated at 69 kv, 2,000 amperes, 3,500 megavolt-amperes (mva) has been developed for outdoor service on the lines of a large metropolitan utility. Designed as individual rollout circuit breaker poles in dust-tight, phase-isolated, outdoor metal enclosures with current transformers on the roof entrance bushings, the circuit breaker has its isolators enclosed within the air blast columns for more reliable operation under icing conditions for future application of the circuit breaker as outdoor porcelain-clad units. Recovery voltage control resistors are used to insure satisfactory performance of the circuit breaker at any circuit recovery rate which may arise on any system in this country."
"A broadening application field for the Presidents' Conference Committee (PCC)-type electric car has introduced new and more severe requirements in the design of its propulsion equipment. This has resulted in a new traction motor embodying the latest progress in design and manufacture and particularly suited to dynamic braking at the high operating speeds currently coming into vogue."
"The application of the Presidents' Conference Committee (PCC) car in rapid transit service led to the development of a new control known as type MCM. This is primarily an all-cam control system comprising two motor-operated controllers. One controller, called the circuit controller, establishes various main and control circuits for power, breaking cushioning, field shunting, and reversing. A second similar controller, called the resistance controller, varies the main motor circuit resistance to hold rate of accelerating or braking as desired."
"The success of the Presidents' Conference Committee (PCC) car in city service has led to the development of a standard lightweight rapid transit car through the collaboration of the American Transit Association, the Transit Research Corporation, and interested manufacturers. The basic features and equipment of the PCC streetcar have been retained except where conditions peculiar to rapid transit service dictated modifications."
"Increased safety of train operation is effected by the continuously controlled cab signal which may be augmented by means for applying the brakes automatically in case cab signal changes calling for a reduction in speed are ignored or pre-determined speed limits are exceeded. The engine-carried apparatus is inductively linked and selectively responsive to coded alternating current in the running rails, the frequency of coding determining the cab signal indication displayed and being dependent upon traffic conditions ahead. Absence of rail current or the presence of uncoded current establishes the most restrictive speed conditions."
"The amount and quality of railroad suburban commuter service will probably increase, rather than decrease, in the future. On electrified roads, multiple-unit trains with all axles motored are coming into use. In contrast with conventional equipment, having about one-half the weight on drivers, these new trains have design and operating features which especially suit them to fill present needs and anticipate future requirements. These qualities are enumerated, and the resulting benefits discussed in their relation to both the passenger and the railroad."
"Presents bibliography of literature on relay technology."
"A modification of the method of using the surge-comparison tester was investigated in regard to detecting and locating turn-to-turn faults in the stator windings of large high-voltage turbine generators. It was found that by using the method devised, the turn insulation can be stressed to as much as several times operating conditions, and both copper-to-copper faults and arcing faults can be detected easily. Limitations of the test method were explored, and recommendations for further improvement of the test, particularly as regards increasing the amount of stress on the insulation, are made."
"A generalized criterion for stability of a closed tandem connection of double-dinodes is given by the expression A(λ) = a11+a22-|a|-1 = 0 in which the a11 are the appropriate terms of the transmission matrix of the tandem net-work prior to closing the loop. If the λ-roots of A(λ) have positive real parts, the closing the transmission loop; that is, the network is unstable. The generalized criterion is applicable to transmission loops incorporating bilateral amplifiers, and the transmission loop may be opened wherever desired without con-sideration of the impedances to the left and right of the cut. The criterion is not limited to transmission networks employing amplifiers; like-wise, it applies equally well to electro-mechanical networks or servomechanisms."
"The proper functioning of electric contacts is of great importance. Much work has been done on contacts,1,2 but comparatively little has been done on types of transient phenomena occurring at circuit break in inductive d-c circuits and their relation to contact erosion. Some work was done on transient types occurring at circuit break in telephone relay circuits by A. M. Curtis and his associates at the Bell Telephone Laboratories.3 This study dealt with transients in d-c circuits, including the fixed inductance of a relay winding and the small distributed capacity of a line wire, and embodied a study of the effect on the transient phenomena of changing the length of the line wire. The present investigation covered the variation of transients occurring for a fixed contact pair over a range of lumped inductance and lumped capacity values in a contact circuit; in addition, effects on the transients of varying the steady-state current (by steady-state current is meant the current immediately preceding circuit break), the voltage impressed on the circuit, and the circuit resistance were studied."
"Noise problems caused by transformer installations in urban situations can be avoided, ameliorated, or corrected by several measures. The application of the least costly of these measures requires in-formation which cannot be obtained easily by analytical methods. Measurements of an acoustic model of the transformer in its environment aids in the evaluation of the particular noise problem and gives design data for sound-reducing barriers."
"Unsymmetrical spacing of conductors produces errors in the values of a-c resistance measured on the individual conductors, of a 3-conductor system, with 3-phase current. The average of two sets of 3-phase measurements, one with positive sequence current and the other with negative sequence current gives the true value of conductor resistance. An analysis given in the Appendix evaluates the effect of unbalanced inductive reactance upon the measured resistance. Experimental data are shown which support the analysis."
"The telegraph terminal set described forms an integral part of a time division multiplex system wherein two, three, or four channels are combined for transmission over a common communication circuit of minimum band width. Channel inputs and outputs are on a start-stop printing telegraph basis for flexibility in connecting to existing conventional start-stop systems. The equipment is packaged in such a manner that all components are readily accessible for maintenance during normal operation without interrupting the flow of traffic."
"With one exception, the carrier telegraph systems of the major record communication companies of the world are operated by the old familiar amplitude-modulated (AM) method. That exception is the huge trunk line and tributary network of the Western Union Telegraph Company which, while realizing excellent spectrum economy, employs frequency modulation. It is the object of this paper to report on the success achieved in operating that network. Years of experience with thousands of frequency-modulated (FM) telegraph channels have demonstrated they may be operated in long tandem chains with excellent continuity of service."
"Previous investigations indicated a trend toward increased application of resonant grounding in the United States. The application of resonant grounding in power systems operating at voltages from 2.4 kv to 230 kv has been analyzed on the basis of answers to a questionnaire received from all organizations using such grounding. Experience with resonant grounding has been very satisfactory. The equipment requires practically no maintenance and hardly any attention since detuning is permissible within reasonable margins. The major field of application of resonant grounding is at voltages of 69 kv and below. Operation on sustained faults has been successful in many systems for hours and even days. More equipment designed for extended time rating than for ``10-minute'' rating has been installed in the last few years. Many users of ``10-minute'' equipment feel that operation on sustained faults would have additional advantages. ERIC T. B. GROSS is Professor of Power Systems Engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Ill., and EDWARD W. ATHERTON is with the I-T-E Circuit Breaker Company, Philadelphia. Pa. Mr. Atherton was an Instructor in Electrical Engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology when most of this investigation was made."
"As first steps in a general study of arc extinction in magnetic-type air circuit breakers, equipment has been developed for simultaneously measuring both arc voltage and arc current just before and after current zero, and studies have been made of arc path conductance and power input in this critical time region for small-scale tests with arcs of a few hundred amperes either magnetically pressed against or physically confined between refractory insulating plates. Analysis in terms of possible mathematical arc models has aided interpretation of the observations. The general nature of the arc reignition process under these conditions has been revealed clearly and the dynamic properties of the arc and surface leakage paths have been determined quantitatively for these tests in terms of the arc model values: conductance time constant and critical power input or critical applied voltage gradient. Some effects on these values of such controllable variables as plate composition and plate separation have been shown. The leakage conductance along the adjacent plate surfaces just after current zero was found to limit the interrupting ability of arcs under the small-sample test conditions, but the relative importance of this compared to the dielectric recovery of the gas space and other possible factors remains to be determined for very high current interruption in actual circuit breaker arc chutes."
"The cable taken as the subject of this paper is the first medium-pressure gas-filled cable constructed for operation above 46 kv. It is believed to be the largest installation of this type of cable up to this time and its design includes several unique features. This discussion covers factors affecting its selection, details of the cable and accessories, special features of the conduit line and salient facts inconnection with its installation and operation."
"This paper describes a full automatic teletypewriter message switching system for use in private-line networks involving one or mores switching centers and a multiplicity of local or long-distance lines, each of which may have one or more stations. This system provides fast teletypewriter communication from any station to any other station or group of stations in the network. At its point of origin a message first is perforated in tape accompanied by suitable directing and end-of-message characters, thereafter it is transmitted automatically, stored temporarily in perforated tape at a switching office, and then routed at high speed to its point or points of destination. Important features are the arrangements provided to permit efficient use of long full duplex transmission lines, the full automatic handling of multiple-address messages with only a single originating transmission, and the various guards and alarms which are provided to protect against loss of messages in case of trouble."
"The single-frequency signaling system for long-distance telephone trunks frees dial calls from the range and other limitations imposed by d-c signaling methods. It uses alternating currents in the voice range as the signaling medium and so can be used with any trunk of any length or type of line facility which meets voice-transmission requirements. The signaling requirements, design problems, main features of the circuit and equipment arrangements, and the operation of this system are outlined in this paper. The system described is the first practical arrangement of its type satisfactorily to meet all the conditions of telephone service in the Bell Telephone System."
"A method of gating between two flip-flop circuits is described. The circuit uses two diodes and is particularly suited to parallel computers. The theory of the gating action and the necessary design information are given."
"Operation of the ENIAC (electronic numerical integrator and calculator), a high-speed electronic computing machine, at the Ballistic Research Laboratories of Aberdeen Proving Ground, has shown that 90 per cent of the service interruptions are caused by vacuum-tube failures. At the beginning of 1950 a tube surveillance program was initiated in which all pertinent data concerning each tube in the system are recorded on punched cards. This paper describes the manner in which faulty vacuum tubes are detected and replaced, and gives the specifications used in testing the tubes and the manner in which the tube history is gathered. Preliminary results, using data collected during the first five months of 1950, are given."
"In January 1950, a 3,600-kva series capacitor was put into operation for the purpose of minimizing lamp flicker produced by large arc furnaces. This installation is unique in that the capacitor is located in series with the terminals of a 20,000-kva 13.8-kv synchronous condenser, rather than in series with the supply system. The capacitor has been operating successfully for over ten months and has produced the desired decrease in lamp flicker. This paper presents a summary of the studies made prior to the installation of the series capacitor, as well as a general discussion of the factors that should be considered in similar applications. Economic factors, which dictated the selection of a series capacitor for decreasing the lamp flicker in this case, and the results of field tests made since the installation was completed are covered in a companion paper.1"
"The best way, theoretically, to maintain ideal voltage conditions on a given feeder is to equip each of its phases with a regulator. However, other factors in addition to voltage regulation must be considered in a practical co-ordinated design. The engineering approach toward accomplishing a purpose with the minimum physical facilities must be adhered to both in improving an old substation and in designing a new one. A very strong incentive to streamline and simplify substations as an outgrowth of congested conditions in old stations and as a means of reducing time and money requirements in building new ones, finds an ally in the closely coupled and densely loaded condition of today's distribution system. The availability of economical and reliable tap-changing equipment and the existence of short distribution feeders together permit, by group regulation, realization of very significant simplifications of substation design, construction, and operation. The preceding examples of conversion to group regulation have three important points in common: 1. The underlying reasons for the changes have been to make space and/or eliminate indoor oil-filled equipment. 2. The work to regroup the feeders by bus section voltage has been an engineering problem only, inasmuch as the change from open-type bus work to metal-enclosed switchgear required moving the feeders physically within the three stations regardless of voltage requirements. 3. Voltage conditions have improved thus far as normal development and changes of the distribution system have occurred during group operation."
"A wide variety of models of interest to economists may be represented by electrical circuits. These models therefore lend themselves to investigation by use of an electrical analogue computer. The economist may study a model with any of three questions in mind: What are its topological features? What is its quantitative behavior for given parameters? What are good estimates of the parameters? This paper shows that analog computing techniques may be useful in helping economists answer all three of these questions."
"Noise testing of fluorescent lamp ballasts has been studied from a number of approaches and found unsatisfactory. A system has evolved which, if acceptable to the industry, may provide a basis for industry specifications and standards regarding this type of measurement. Study and comment by industry is encouraged."
"In the manufacture of large high-speed turbine-generator rotors, balancing is instrumental in contributing to the over-all performance characteristics of the entire unit. Balancing equipment and instrumentation must be adequate to meet the rigorous demands imposed by shop production requirements. In addition, procedures and techniques must be capable of coping with the various problems that may arise in production balancing. This paper presents a review of the equipment and procedures introduced in shop and field balancing by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation as part of a continuing program of design and manufacturing development. It is hoped that the discussion may be of service in furthering an understanding of vibration control as reflected in the primary goal of improving machine performance."
"The Naval Research Laboratory has designed and operated two long-range multichannel pulse-time modulation telemetering systems for over 55 V-2 and Viking rocket firings at the White Sands Proving Grounds. Design and operational data are given for a 23-channel, 1-kw peak pulse power system and for an improved 30-channel, 4-kw peak pulse power system, together with photographs of the equipment and sample records obtained."
"The design of automatic control systems to give ``optimum'' response is discussed in terms of the area between a step disturbance and the control response. It is shown that this ``control area'', and also a ``weighted control area'' may be calculated directly from the system parameters without finding the roots of an algebraic equation. Assumed optimum values of these areas permit direct synthesis of the necessary control sensitivities for an ``optimum'' control response. An example of an aircraft engine control is given and the connection with zero velocity error servos is shown."
"Electric multiple-unit cars afford the most economical method of handling suburban passenger service, provided the volume of traffic warrants the high initial expense of electrification. Nevertheless, because of the low use factor of these cars in commuter traffic, fixed charges are a high percentage of the total cost of the service. It is important to reduce these fixed charges by finding means for lowering the initial cost of multiple-unit car equipment. It also is important to simplify such equipment in order to minimize maintenance costs. One method which has proved to be effective in reducing costs in many other fields is that of standardization. The development of rectifier-type motive power for application on high-voltage a-c systems gives promise of effecting a degree of standardization for the majority of applications by the wider use of low-voltage d-c traction equipment. Further economies should be possible by careful selection of available alternatives in details of the equipment. Various choices are discussed with particular reference to low cost and low maintenance."
"A major factor in the development of the 4-motor equipment for use on a-c multiple-unit cars was the design of a suitable truck-mounted traction motor. Numerous electrical and mechanical problems had to be solved. The resultant design differs radically from the conventional axle-hung motor employed in such applications for the past 20 years. Preliminary operating experience indicates advantages comparable to those being realized with similar d-c equipment."
"Recent years have witnessed a growing demand for improvements in a-c multiple-unit car equipments. This paper, together with three companion papers,1,2,3 deals with principal objectives of the improvement program and shows how they were attained in new equipments now going into revenue service on a large eastern railroad. The principal improvements center in the use of four newly designed traction motors per car, instead of the usual two, and a resistance acceleration scheme containing a new motor-driven cam controller. Improvements also were made in protective schemes and in arrangement of apparatus. Dynamic braking, now being worked out as a next logical development step for a-c cars, also is discussed briefly."
"This paper describes a new train performance calculator recently placed in service by the Pennsylvania Railroad in Philadelphia. This calculator was developed to compute and record mechanically and quickly information required by a railroad to determine the economics, application, proper size, and tonnage ratings for new types of motive power, which information previously was assembled from a large number of tedious step-by-step mathematical calculations. The machine consists of three self-balancing, potentiometer-type, curve-drawing instruments, electrically interconnected, and a low-energy auxiliary circuit. The latter contains apparatus necessary to represent effective forces which influence the movement of a train and to represent certain types of motion which must be calculated to determine the performance of a theoretical train. The simplicity of its control and operation makes it suitable for continuous use in a quiet engineering office."
"There are a number of empirical and rationally derived methods described in the technical literature for the predetermination of the end-turn leakage reactance of an induction machine stator winding. The use of these calculation methods will yield widely different results when applied to a particular machine winding. Since the isolation of the end-turn leakage reactance from test results requires extensive and tedious experimental work, the designer seldom, if ever, has the opportunity to verify the accuracy of the calculation method which he uses. It is the object of the subject study to determine experimentally the actual endturn leakage reactance for a limited size range and variety of 3-phase squirrel-cage induction motor winding conditions. The experimental data are used to evaluate the relative accuracy of several published calculation methods, and to suggest refinements in one of these methods which will permit attainment of practical degrees of accuracy in design calculations. An empirical calculation method published by Alexander Gray is found to be more accurate in its predictions for the range of machine sizes involved than any of the other methods considered, however, it is limited to use with stator windings having only full pole pitch coils. Since modern design practice dictates, from several considerations, the use of fractional pitch coils, it is necessary to develop additional empirical data to enable calculation of end-turn leakage reactance for this condition."
"Repeater fuses have been used on rural lines of the Northern Indiana Public Service Company for the last 15 years. During this period our methods of application have been improved to the point that the results obtained make us feel that this method of automatic sectionalizing of rural lines is quite satisfactory. Three-shot repeater fuses now are standard for sectionalizing rural lines for the entire company. This paper is intended to give a comprehensive picture of the performance of repeater fuses as we have found it, so that other engineers may have the same information when studying alternative plans for sectionalizing on their own system."
"The total cost of power delivered to trolley coaches is influenced by system engineering as well as by prevailing power rates. In the case of a single-unit rectifier substation, the equipment cost per kilowatt decreases as substation rating increases. With increases in substation rating, however, proportionately more feeder copper is required to distribute the power from each station. Evaluation of these factors for various headways reveals substation ratings and spacings which result in minimum system investment. Cost of power delivered at the trolley coach is the sum of fixed charges and operating costs of the substations and overhead. Such factors as the number of points of power delivery, maintenance expense, and depreciation rates affect the over-all power cost. Their influence upon selection of substation rating is discussed. By careful investigation of all variables, the transit operator is able to minimize the cost of power delivered to his vehicles."
"An, equivalent circuit is suggested to represent the d-c machine when operating under near normal current conditions. This equivalent circuit contains resistances, inductances, and speed-voltage constants. Certain d-c tests are suggested for obtaining the resistances and speed-voltage constants. Either the transient or a-c methods may be employed for ascertaining the inductances although the a-c method seems the simpler; circuits and techniques are described for both methods. Experimental verification of the equivalent circuit and methods of measurement take the form of application to a compound motor and to the amplidyne, a complex d-c machine with many diverse windings on the same magnetic circuit."
"This paper reports the development of a new synthetic resin bonded mica tape insulation for high-voltage stator windings. It reviews the problems associated with earlier forms of high-voltage machine insulation. The general construction and processing of the insulation are described briefly. Comprehensive test data are presented on the characteristics of the materials employed and the resultant physical and electrical properties obtained on the composite insulation. This new insulation is now being applied to turbine generators for central station service."
"A summary of the mniminium leakage distances for the several insulating materials investigated is presented in Table II. These data were obtained for direct current applications using the measuring techniques described in the appendix. The determination of safe minimum leakage distances for power installations is dependent upon the following considerations: 1. The minimum safe distance is dependent upon the leakage current across the surface of the insulation. The voltage associated with the minimum safe current, namely tracking voltage, serves as a criterion for establishing this minimum distance. Exceeding this criterion either by increased voltage or reduced distance will result in ultimate breakdown and complete destruction of the insulating properties of the insulation. 2. The establishment of minimum safe leakage distances requires an accurate knowledge of the environmental conditions where the insulation will be employed. The deposition of water and soluble conducting contaminants such as sodium chloride and sodium sulfate will affect the tracking voltage greatly. 3. The arc resisting qualities of an insulating material will, to a large extent, determine the safe minimum leakage distance. Further investigation should be made to determine the factors affecting leakage distances in alternating current systems and the relationship to direct current values. Surge voltages and the benefits derived from barriers should also be analyzed to add further knowledge to the limitations of insulation and insulated structures."
"A maintenance inspection program making available manufacturer's experience is described. General service experience with high-voltage machine insulation is reviewed. Several specific field problems are discussed. Likely failure causes are found to result from disturbance to the physical integrity of the insulation rather than a gradual deterioration caused by sustained electric stress. Inspection procedures, testing techniques, and equipment available in connection with the program are outlined."
"A program studying voltage endurance of various mica insulations is reported. This includes dielectric breakdown data with both alternating and direct current on numerous similar samples. Effects of repetitive testing, prolonged a-c (60-cycle) stress and mechanical damage to mica insulation are reported. Detection of insulation faults is described and conclusions are drawn that d-c overpotential maintenance tests can be equally searching but less damaging than a-c overpotential tests for large high-voltage rotating machinery."
"Today, the mercury arc rectifier has virtually superseded the older forms of conversion equipment for supplying power to trolley coach and street railway transit systems. The present trend when selecting a rectifier rated 1,000 kw or less is to choose the sealed ignitron type. The sealed ignitron rectifier is metal-enclosed, which makes possible a unit substation type of equipment when it is combined with metal-enclosed switchgear. This gives increased safety to personnel and a reduction in installation cost. A number of substation arrangements are possible, including installation of part or even all of the equipment outdoors in weatherproof enclosures, thus reducing building costs. Operating experience with close to 4,000 sealed ignitron tubes has demonstrated that they can be expected to have an average life of alt least six years. Their 1-minute rating of 200 per cent load is more than adequate to handle an urban transit load composed of a number of small increments, where diversity serves to reduce the magnitude of peak swings. In keeping with the smaller equipment ratings possible with sealed ignitrons, light-duty switchgear has been introduced having the necessary current and interrupting ratings at lower initial cost. The high reliability of rectifiers makes it possible in many cases to install a single-unit substation where before two smaller conversion units would have been used. Operators are beginning to recognize this and to take advantage of the savings this accomplishes."
"This paper covers: 1. An analysis of available fuse data with special reference to the data's applicability for resistance welding machines. 2. A proposed method of analysis of fuse characteristics. 3. Discussion of these fuse characteristics. 4. Use of these characteristics in welding applications. 5. The application of fuses as it is practiced in the industry today. The data that are presented are based only on 250-volt fuses. Six-hundred-volt fuses were checked and found to have characteristics substantially the same as 250-volt fuses. Consequently, any system of rating of 250-volt fuses applies also to other fuses."
"Discussions on the reasons for development,the technical details,and the application of microwave comunications equipment have been presented previously. A study of the schematics for these equipment will make it obvious that microwave equipment is made up of arrangements of parts which differ widely fom those normally encountered in electronic equipment for industrial applications. The purpose of this paper is to show why this difference exists. For example, it will be shown why a microwave receiver may need 20 or more tubes and a power-line carrier receiver may require only one tube. To illustrate why microwave equipment is different,an analysis will be made of portions of the Westinghouse type FB940 960-megacycle communications equipment."
"Strip steel with preferred grain orientation has been applied successfully to stator punchings of 2-pole turbine generators. Tests on 16 generators ranging from 1,000-kw to 20,000-kw rating indicate a reduction of 25 to 30 per cent in core losses and 50 per cent in required magnetomotive force in the stator punchings, compared with generators built with present nonoriented hotrolled sheet steels. Use of oriented strip steel permits design of generators of greater efficiency, greater rating for a given size, or both. Effective use is being made of this material in the design of certain 2-pole generators ranging in rating from 1,000 kw, 0.8 power factor, to 125,000 kw, 0.85 power factor.1 This paper describes the specific application of oriented strip steel to turbine generators in the range of 1,000 kw to 20,000 kw. The advantages of the oriented strip material over the former nonoriented materials are discussed. Test results on 16 generators using oriented strip are presented. The material itself is described, and a brief history of its development given. Special generator manufacturing processes required when using the oriented strip, as well as some of the equipment used, are described. Possible further developments are touched upon."
"The deep-bar rotor may be defined as a single-cage rotor in which skin effect plays a prominent part. With rotor slots nearly one inch deep, skin effect reduces starting current and increases starting torque so that in many ratings this type of motor has superseded the older shallow cage motor. This paper will endeavor to supply the theory of the tapered bar and of bars with a tapered section.It also will endeavor to improve the theory of the round bar. A graphical method for computing the impedance of any shape of bar will be given.The formulas developed indicate that further improvements should result if the bar is somewhat enlarged near the slot opening.It will be hown that: 1) The tapered bar is superior to the rectangular bar, provided the narrow portion is near the top. 2) Further improvements should be sought among bars of compound shape. 3)The slot constant,for a round slot is close to 0.72when running."
"In this paper there is presented a new method of normal voltage reduced current starting for induction motors. The scheme consists in connecting one phase of a 3-phase winding in series during the starting period only, the other phases having circuits in parallel. When full speed is attained, the series connected winding is opened momentarily, and then put back on the line in parallel. This gives the advantages of reduced current without any current surge on reclosing, no external impedance, and a low cost of control. It provides about half torque with two-thirds average current, as compared to full voltage starting; it gives a smooth torque curve on the Y connection, and only a small one-third speed torque dip on delta connection; and it allows about 50 per cent greater stalled time than on full voltage. Although this type of connection will draw unbalanced line currents, this appears unimportant. In most cases there will be other machines on the line to act as phase balancers and absorb the relatively small negative sequence current. Formulas are given for currents and torque with and without external impedances. Formulas are in terms of voltage and forward, backward, and zero phase sequence impedances."
"A new limiter circuit for use with electronic analogue computers has been developed from the basic diode bridge circuit. This limiter is simple in construction, has only one adjustment and produces an absolute limit. Other useful circuit configurations using the basic diode bridge are given."
"Occasionally it is desirable and even necessary to have available sources of voltage supply of harmonic frequencies. Rotating machines with the appropriate number of poles have been used for this purpose. When the power requirements are low, electronic devices may be used. This paper presents results of an analysis of a nonlinear static element circuit which also may be useful as an efficient source of voltage supply of harmonic frequency of good wave form. The circuit is unique in that it uses neither rotating parts nor electronic devices."
"1. The basic theory of approximate calculation by the use of subareas of the capacitance of a plane area and of the distribution of charge density over it is outlined. 2. The method of subareas is employed to obtain an accurate value for the capacitance of an annulus of ratio of outer to inner radius of ro/ri=1.5. 3. The fourth approximation to the capacitance of a specified circular disk, as calculated by the method of subareas, is found to be in good agreement with the known exact value. As a circular disk is an annulus of ratio of radii ro/ri=∞, it is to be concluded that the fourth approximation for the much narrower annulus of ratio 1.5 is very nearly the exact value. This conjecture is substantiated by the curve of Figure 3. 4. Comparison in Figure 6 of the charge distribution on a circular disk as determined both from the known equation and by the method of subareas indicates that calculation of charge distribution by use of subareas affords a good approximation to the actual distribution. Accordingly, the charge distribution of Figure 7 for the much narrower annulus is to be considered as a close approximation to the actual distribution. 5. The universal curve of Figure 8 yields the capacitance of an annulus of any stated ratio of external to internal radii."
"Previously developed methods of analysis of magnetic amplifiers with gradually varying incremental permeability are applied to the study of the general transient response of single-stage amplifiers. In the first part of the paper, curves are presented which describe the transient response of magnetic amplifiers without feedback in general dimensionless form. The curves apply for transients in which the alternating voltage at the amplifier terminals is constant, but convey useful information also for other actual operating conditions. In the second part, the analysis is extended to feedback amplifiers with a-c output operating in conditions of negligible commutation. Experimental checks indicate the order of accuracy obtainable."
"This paper analyzes the behavior of a-c rotating machines connected to stationary networks or transmission lines and other rotating machines under synchronous or asynchronous operation. Rotating reference frames are introduced. The forward and backward components are correlated to the direct-axis and quadrature-axis components in a simple manner. Part I deals with the interconnection of a rotating machine and a terminal network or a transmission line with lumped or distributed constants. Part II deals with the interconnection of rotating machines. A general network of n machines is analyzed. Part III considers a general machine with n1 stator phases and n2 rotor phases under synchronous or asynchronous operation. Concatenation of induction machines and selsyns are studied by means of rotating reference frames."
"Transformer-loss compensators provide an economical means for metering the loads of utility company customers supplied at transmission voltages on the low-voltage side of the power transformer bank by compensating the watt-hour meter to include the transformer losses in its registration. Improvements have been made in the basic compensator1 by neutralizing the effect of the flow of meter potential circuit current through the copper-loss compensator. This improves the performance of the compensator, particularly on inductive loads, and makes possible its correct adjustment also for the higher values of losses incurred with var compensation. The burdens imposed by the compensator are sufficiently small to be acceptable in watt-hour metering practice, and for connection to the output side of standard var autotransformers. Under present-day conditions the use of transformer-loss compensators results not only in economies, but also in the conservation of critical materials that would be required for high-voltage instrument transformers on metering installations."
"A study of the power supply to the United Electric Railways was initiated when new construction necessitated the re-location of rotary converters. Replacement with modern equipment was considered in conjunction with a comprehensive study of the entire power supply. It was evident that the losses on the United Electric Railways feeder and trolley system would be the controlling economic factor. A method of calculating the losses in this d-c supply system was developed, correlated with a measured value of losses, and extended to determine the relative merits of proposed feeder changes and rectifier installations. It is believed that this is the first published study that has made use of available probability methods for calculating losses, voltage drop, flicker, and capacity requirements in a study of the power supply for an electric transportation system. The rotary converters were replaced with 60-cycle rectifiers at two new locations. The design of these substations incorporated certain novel features for the protection of equipment and personnel."
"During the past few years there have been numerous systems of supervisory control and coded digital selectors designed and described in various papers. These systems, as a whole, have been designed for specific use as power-supervisory control units, or as commercial-telephone circuit-switching and trunking assemblies. The purpose of this paper, however, has been to discuss some signaling and supervisory-trunking systems used in conjunction with the normal operation of a large power utility. It has further been desired to illustrate these systems as they are applied to carrier-current systems and mediums of transmission."
"A pulse-type echo ranging fault locator has been developed which is suitable for locating sustained faults on telephone and power transmission lines. A number of these instruments have been in service for several years. They have been used to locate a wide variety of power and telephone line faults with significant reductions in service interruptions and economies in line patrolling. Before a new circuit is energized it may be tested with the linascope to ensure that all construction grounds have been removed and that all transpositions are correct. Telephone circuits also may be tested to locate sources of mismatch which introduce transmission losses. An automatic fault locator has been developed, which operates on the same principle and which automatically records the locations of sustained or transient power line faults."
"The paper illustrates the application of the theory of electric machinery to the practical design of a static magnetic exciter. The basic exciter circuit is of such nature as to make the alternator (which is energized by the exciter) as much self-regulating as possible. Remaining deviations of the alternator voltage affect a voltage-sensitive circuit which provides a correction signal to the exciter. The energy for the exciter is obtained entirely from the alternator. With this system, no antihunt means are needed, and the steady-state alternator voltage can be easily held within ±0.6 per cent. The transient response is rapid and yet well damped. A short circuit of the alternator will not cause loss of excitation; as a matter of fact, during a short circuit the excitation becomes several times normal, a feature which is desirable for the selective tripping of protective devices."
"The growing need in science, medicine, and technology for intense sources of high-energy particles and other forms of ionizing energy is being met to an increasing extent by devices which depend upon electrostatic forces and principles. The vitality of these modern uses of ionizing energy and the unique effectiveness of the electrostatic accelerator in meeting their requirements are evident in such diverse activities as experimental nuclear research, the super-voltage X-ray treatment of disease, and the sterilization of biologicals and foods by streams of high-energy electrons."
"Careful inspection of ACSR (steel-reinforced aluminum cable) conductors operating for ten years equipped with torsional dampers has shown no apparent damage due to aeolian vibration. Type HH copper conductor without dampers has been operating for a similar period without trouble. Further experimental work indicates that there is little tendency for ACSR conductors to vibrate at tensions less than 8 per cent of their ultimate strength."
"This report is similar in many respects to the committee report on Inductive Co-ordination Aspects of Rectifier Installations, published in 1946,1 with the important difference that the latter dealt solely with the a-c side. The present report, which deals with effects associated with d-c systems supplied by rectifiers, can be considered as complementing the 1946 report and material contained in the latter is not generally repeated here. To date, inductive co-ordination problems associated with the output side of rectifiers have involved chiefly d-c traction systems having a single overhead trolley per track (that is, ground-return systems) particularly those having nominal operating voltages of the order of 600 volts direct current. Hence, subsequent to Part II, which describes ways of classifying the d-c sides of proposed installations into three categories, the major part of the more detailed discussion and quantitative information in this report is devoted largely to the 600-volt system with overhead trolley. Summarized technical information, which will serve at least as background material and which will generally be useful in case the inductive co-ordination aspects of a specific rectifier installation require more or less detailed study and analysis also is included."
"Commutation in thyratron or ignitron inverters can be effected with the aid of capacitors connected across the output terminals of the inverter. Since these inverters require no transformers for commutation or coupling, they may be operated over a wide range of frequencies extending down to zero. In this paper a simplified analysis is made of a 3-phase capacitor-commutated inverter with a resistive load when the inverter is operating with constant input current. Calculated waveforms of the inverter obtained from this analysis are presented for various values of load resistance. Experimental waveforms are included to evaluate the effect of ripple in the input current."
"A constant rate of progression of frequency of a motor-driven heterodyne oscillator is obtained by comparing its output with a frequency standard. The result is fed into a servo loop which drives the motor at the proper speed. When used in connection with a level recorder a linear frequency scale is obtained which is more accurate than the static calibration of the oscillator."
"A new method is described for supervising sectionalizing devices on distribution systems by utilizing a centrally transmitted, unmodulated carrier. This carrier is remotely modulated by equipment located on the load side of the monitored sectionalizing device, and the modulated carrier is received at a conveniently located receiver. A novel indicator gives instantaneous warning of operation of sectionalizing devices or equipment failure. Simplicity and low cost make its use on distribution systems feasible for monitoring of large numbers of sectionalizing devices."
"Provides both a Subject and Author Index."
"Presents the front cover for this issue of the publication."
"In this paper certain magnetic amplifier circuits will be illustrated and their circuit equations presented subject to certain assumptions. The equations will be interpreted in as clear a manner as the author thinks possible and some conclusions will be drawn. Since the mathematics of analysis of magnetic amplifiers is quite complex as viewed from continuous theory a clearer period by period interpretation will be pursued during which periods the equations may be considered as a continuous, elementary and reasonably accurate representation of the phenomena. The two periods which will be used are those during which the amplifier output current is large (conducting period); and during which the amplifier output current is of the order of the magnetizing current (nonconducting period). Equivalent circuits for each period will be set up. The final conditions of one period will represent the initial conditions of the following period. The two assumptions utilized in this analysis are ``ideal'' magnetization curves for the core materials, Figure 1, and ``ideal'' rectifiers. The best core materials and rectifiers manufactured today rather closely approximate these assumed conditions. A resistive load impedance will be used for simplification of the mathematics. The conclusions drawn from these elementary considerations will form a basis for predicting the performance of examples of certain novel circuits which shall have properties of an unusual nature. Practical discussion of these circuits is beyond the scope of this paper and will be presented elsewhere."
"The trend towards widespread utilization of diesel-electric motive power in main-line operations continues unabated with some authorities predicting complete dieselization in the relatively near future. There can be no denying the physical superiority of diesel-electric locomotives over the fast disappearing steam locomotives that have dominated the American motive power scene for over 100 years. There are, however, economic questions of some importance raised by the phenomenal speed with which the change-over is being accomplished and the consequent demand imposed on the nation's middle distillate capacity and the petroleum resources upon which this capacity depends. Locomotives with electric traction motors are probably here for the long pull, but there may be reason to believe that the electrical energy to supply their traction motors can be produced at lower cost in ways other than with diesel-electric prime movers. Under certain circumstances of petroleum product demand and supply the gas-turbine electric locomotive may be found to have an economic justification. Similarly, the trolley-electric locomotive can undoubtedly be justified in situations where hydroelectric, and perhaps other low cost electric generating facilities create a competitive price differential sufficient to overcome the initial cost handicap occasioned in providing the fixed facilities required to bring energy to the pantographs of trolley-electric locomotives. In the Pacific Northwest, for example, it can be demonstrated that on the basis of present prices of electric energy and diesel fuel the extra investment required for operation of trolley-electric locomotives can be recovered from operating savings in about ten years."
"Over 4,000,000 kilovars of static capacitors designed for power-factor improvement and voltage regulations have been manufactured in Japan. About half have been used for voltage regulation at primary substations in place of synchronous condensers and are directly connected to lines operating from 11 to 77 kv. The largest installation has a capacity of 80,000 kilovars. More than 60 per cent of the electric power in Japan comes from hydroelectric sources that are remote from their load centers and synchronous condensers are generally installed at the end of the long transmission lines for voltage regulation. This offers an excellent field for static capacitors. The development of a paper dielectric several times thicker than standard capacitor papers has permitted the construction of single capacitors rated as high as 500 kilovars. The cost of a comparable new unit is less than a third of that of a conventional unit of 30 kilovars, the largest generally made. This has made the static capacitor a strong competitor of the synchronous condenser. A number of technical difficulties have been encountered. Waveform distortion, in particular, has caused abnormal current flow resulting in false operation of relays and excessive vibration and noise in transformers. This distortion was found to be due to magnetic saturation of the transformer cores and could be avoided by inserting a suitable reactor in series with the capacitor. Another technical problem concerned the development of a switch for frequent operation in the range from 11 to 77 kv."
"A method of analysis is outlined to solve steady-state problems arising in the operation of large interconnected transmission systems exchanging power between their own operating divisions and outside companies. Special attention is paid to the calculation of total and incremental losses for economic loading studies and to the allocation of incremental losses between the various subsidiary and outside companies. This first part restricts itself to lay the necessary foundations for the numerical study made in a companion paper1 on the system of the American Gas and Electric Company."
"This paper describes a highspeed telemetering system which uses frequency as a translating means. Equipment for two different frequency bands of 20 to 25 cycles and 80 to 100 cycles has been developed. The system is electronic and the lag between a change in the primary quantity to a change in the receiver is less than 0.4 second. The system is independent of the wave shape and amplitude of the signal over extremely wide limits. Means are provided for automatic calibration at frequent intervals which compensate for changes in vacuum tubes and other circuit elements."
"The construction of Canada's first subway is scheduled for completion in the City of Toronto by the end of 1953. Since there were no standards to be continued, full advantage was taken of new methods and materials. A brief description is given of much of the equipment, particularly the cars which will be 130 in number and of the lightweight Presidents' Conference Committee(PCC) type."
"The extensive tests reported herein have provided additional data on cable-sheath performance characteristics which readily can be applied to design practice by published methods.8,9,10 These data indicate: 1. Bending strain is the important consideration in determining sheath life of expansion loops in manholes. 2. If bending strains are low (cables of small diameter, lightly loaded, or cables in large manholes permitting large training radii), copper-lead or thin-wall alloy sheaths are satisfactory. 3. As cable diameter or loading increases, other factors being equal, strain increases. 4. Small expansion loops in restricted manholes increase the strain. 5. If bending strain exceeds a certain value, copper-lead will have a short life, and alloy sheaths should be used. 6. If the maximum permissible strain for standard alloy sheath is exceeded, additional strain resistance is best obtained by increased sheath thickness. 7. If bending strains are too high, the sheath increases in diameter, develops wrinkles and may fail from expansion rather than bending fatigue. 8. Thin-wall sheaths, in addition to lower resistance to bending and internal pressure, tend to wrinkle from handling. These wrinkles may cause stress concentrations and nonuniform bending resulting in short sheath life. 9. F-3 alloy is further substantiated as a superior sheathing material by this extension of previously published data."
"Details are given of a wideband coupling equipment for carrier current working with reasons for preferring interphase coupling followed by an investigation into the causes of noise on power line carrier circuits and the reasons for the adoption of single side-band equipment. Recent types of British communications and relaying equipment are then described."
"A new method of inspection of impregnation of solid-type cable insulation was developed. This method is based on the property of oils and waxes to fluoresce when activated by ultraviolet light. This method reveals details of impregnation in new cables and wax formation in old cables that are not apparent with ordinary light."
"This paper describes field acceptance tests made on the 230-kv 10,000- mva (megavolt-ampere) impulse circuit breaker switching units furnished for the new Right Switchyard at the Grand Coulee Dam power plant. Details of the circuit breaker design are followed by a description of a successful series of line dropping and fault tests made on a single pole circuit breaker unit to observe its performance up to rating and to determine the capabilities of the circuit breaker for higher short circuit duties which will be available at this location in the near future. Line dropping tests were made up to a maximum of 300 lines-miles without restrikes and, therefore, without abnormal overvoltages. Seven fault tests were made at full station capacity with short circuit duties up to 12,000 mva, with interrupting times ranging from 1.75 to 3.0 cycles, and with reclosing times of 9 cycles. The condition of the contacts and oil at the end of the test indicated that a substantial number of additional tests could have been made without replacement. There was no distress on any test and no trouble developed with any mechanical operations or breaker parts. These tests together with factory laboratory tests indicate the suitability of the 10,000 mva interrupting rating for this design of low-oil-content impulse circuit breaker and the possibility of building similar circuit breakers for higher ratings when the requirement arises."
"The adoption of forced-oil forced-air cooling for large power transformers by the electric industry has created a new problem for the operator of the equipment. The experience of this large utility has been that the supplier has not furnished a self-cooled rating for his product. The problem of determining the self-cooled rating has thus fallen upon the purchaser and the operator of the equipment. This paper discusses the operating problems caused by the partial or complete loss of auxiliary cooling equipment of this type of transformer."
"In the past, feedback control systems have been designed by methods employing educated guesses, guided conception or dynamic synthesis.1 Under the restrictive assumption that the fixed part of the system-the summing point, final control element and essential auxiliaries peculiar to the particular system-can be described by a linear differential equation with constant coefficients, a method is suggested herein whereby feedback control systems can be synthesized to prescribed performance requirements by a more direct procedure. A mathematical description of the desired frequency response, based on the location of the poles and zeros of the closed loop function, is made which insures that the specifications of velocity or acceleration error constant, bandwidth, and relative stability will be met and provides for acceptable system transient response. Algebraic manipulation yields the transfer function of main loop and subsidiary feedback loop corrective networks required to meet the specifications."
"The trends and amount of electric power use and cost at bituminous coal mines are of interest to the executive, the operating man, and the engineer alike. A study of the data based on a single year, or even a few years, could result in misleading conclusions; but the data from over 400 representative mines for the past 26 years make it possible to determine the trends quite accurately. These trends, illustrated by graphs and tables, are discussed in this paper."
"Metallic rectifiers are a comparatively new means of converting power from alternating current to direct current. Most of the component apparatus used in the Telephone Systems operates with direct current while the normal power source is alternating current. Therefore a static device without expendable parts which is obtainable in small and large current capacity lends itself as a means for power conversion in telephone power plants."
"The memory of a number of electronic computers is based on the storage of discrete charges on the inner face of a cathode ray tube. The effect of variations in the resistor network determining the location of these charges is investigated in this paper. It is shown that substantial advantages can be derived from a raster with nonuniform spacing, such a raster having somewhat the appearance of the stripes of a Scotch Plaid."
"Accepted grounding methods have been modified for use in areas having difficult grounding conditions. Satisfactory transmission line grounding in rocky areas is obtained economically where the improved methods are followed. Long rods are effective in reducing distribution neutral voltages to an acceptable sustained maximum of 15 volts, which introduces a negligible hazard. Measurements taken on an air-switch installation showed the superiority, over that with rods alone, of a grounding arrangement incorporating a mat or grid. On the basis of these tests, it is proposed to use such a mat to control the potentials possible between switch handle and ground. Personnel and equipment at generating stations under construction are protected from fault currents by connecting all equipment on the ungrounded distribution system to a common metallic circuit. Ground detectors are used if this arrangement is not practical. Completed stations are safely grounded both for power-frequency system faults and lightning surges. In most instances, separate grounding arrangements are necessary for each type of installation."
"The electric insect trap, consisting of a filament or luminous tube light surrounded by an exposed high-voltage elecrocuting grid posseses shock and fire hazards. Although little is known regarding the phenomena of insect electrocution, efficient electrocution of small insects with a reduction of these hazards to an acceptable degree may be accomplished by proper design, construction, and installation. The limited success of insect traps is attributed to fouling of the electrocuting grids by the remains of insects sticking to the electrocuting grids. Although efficiency of electrocution is important, effectiveness of the device depends upon the grids remaining in operating condition. The arc produced when the insect flies between the electrodes of the grid may puncture the insect's body and release a sufficient amount of its body fluid to cover it with a gluey liquid. As the insect falls in the vicinity of the electrodes, the electrostatic forces may cause it to impinge on one of the electrodes. If sufficient body fluid has been exuded by the time it touches an electrode it may stick in a manner similar to a fly lighting on a freshly varnished surface. Although the insect remains may or may not interfere with the electrocuting grid, or they may be consumed by the arc in a short time, it is probable that fouling is responsible for many of the unsatisfactory reports from the field. Electrocuting grids which are less subject to fouling must be devised, and two designs of improved grids are proposed by the author."
"An experimental underwater repeater recently installed in one of The Western Union Telegraph Company's transatlantic nonloaded telegraph cables increased the operating speed of the cable from 50 words per minute to 167 words per minute. The repeater is located 170 miles at sea in a depth of 270 fathoms which places it beyond shallow coastal waters where disturbance levels are high. The cable beyond the repeater is in deep water and free from disturbance so that signals alone are amplified and the signal-to-noise ratio at the terminal is greatly increased. The 3-stage amplifier and signal-shaping networks are mounted in a pressure-equalized steel case. Power for the repeater is supplied by rectifiers at the cable terminal. The repeater includes a switch, under control of the terminal, by means of which spare vacuum tubes can be substituted or the cable can be cut directly through for operation without repeater."
"The Hot Spot Rise Simulator provides a means for obtaining improved accuracy and dependability in the indication of hot-spot temperatures in electric power equipment. When used in connection with the operation of transformers, it avoids the difficulties experienced with earlier types of hot-spot indicators by restricting the apparatus mounted within the transformer to a rugged thermojunction and by limiting the remaining equipment to a thermocouple potentiometer and the Rise Simulator device itself. To insure that this method would not lead to large errors under extreme ambient temperature conditions, calculations were made of the effects of variations in top-oil temperature and load current over a wide range. The errors so calculated are less than the probable uncertainty inherent in the determination of hot-spot temperatures from heat run data."
"Very little has been published in the past regarding the hazard to the integrity of long control circuits due to possible excessive rise in ground potential at one end of the circuits during station faults; and the verification of the safety of such control circuits through actual tests. This paper describes the rather unique arrangement at Grand Coulee power plant wherein the plant is located at the bottom of the Columbia River Channel and one of the associated 230-kv switching stations is located on a rocky plateau approximately 600 feet higher in elevation, thus requiring control cables over 4,000 feet in length. By means of several fault tests staged specifically for this purpose, and as a by-product of subsequent high-interrupting capacity circuit breaker tests, the actual rise in ground potential was determined and the safety of the control circuits positively verified, under 60-cycle fault conditions."
"This paper presents an analytical method for calculating sags, tensions, and lengths of overhead cables. The method is applicable to both level and non-level spans; self contained, not requiring the use of precalculated data or functions; and adaptable to both cables with constant modulus of elasticity, such as steel or copper, and cables such as steel reinforced aluminum cable where stress-strain curves must be resorted to. Included in the method is a direct calculation of the horizonital component of tension in a span where the tension at either support is known. Increments of length of cable are calculated rather than total lengths, thus permitting adequate accuracy to be had using a 10-inch slide rule."
"The use of a feed-back electronic control circuit permits measurement of steady-state carbon-pile regulator characteristics throughout the complete operating range. Measurements obtained using such a circuit reveal the part played by magnetic hysteresis in determining regulator performance. The effects of ambient temperature and carbon-pile power dissipation have also been studied and the latter is found to be of greater relative importance. Magnetic hysteresis is found to have the beneficial effect of permitting good regulation of large disturbances, yet tending to stabilize the regulated system in the steady state."
"Permanent-magnet alternators offer a substantial reduction in weight and space for aircraft and portable applications and are therefore becoming more attractive. In this paper qualitative remarks are made on the major electrical factors to be considered in beginning the design of this class of machines; these are: voltage regulation, magnet stabilization, rotor design, subtransient reactance, negative sequence reactance, heating, and efficiency."
"The necessity for long distance transmission of electric power has grown rapidly during recent years. Line reactance becomes a problem of increasing importance when transmission distances continue to increase. Long lines cannot be loaded sufficiently for maximum over-all economy because of limitations imposed by transient stability an kilovar requirements. The most important alternative to reduction in equivalent line impedance by further increase in transmission voltage, is the use of line reactance compensation. Such compensation can best be obtained through the use of capacitors operating in series with the line conductors. To permit the use of series capacitors rated on the basis of normal load conditions, it is necessary to protect them effectively during line fault conditions. To make maximum use of line reactance compensation with capacitors it is necessary to by-pass and protect them only during line fault condition and reinsert them with minimum delay after the line fault is cleared. Lack of means for accomplishing the latter has prevented the use of capacitors for line reactance compensation where the primary objective is increasing power transmission. While protective devices have been developed which are adequate for use with series capacitors when used to improve voltage regulation, they are by far too slow in operation to meet the requirements when series capacitors are used to increase power transmission."
"Development and evaluation of corona measurements have contributed greatly toward solution of the problem of determining satisfactory voltage stress levels in capacitors. Until recent years, short-time voltage breakdown tests were the only quick means of determining required dielectric thicknesses. However, practical operating voltage stress levels were established more by service experience than by short-time measurements. The time consumed in obtaining the service experience on new materials or designs made advances in design practice slow and uncertain. During the last 15 years it has become evident how closely the life of a capacitor in service is linked with the ionization voltage level of its dielectric. New measurement techniques have been developed, by means of which insulation ionization levels can be quickly and quantitatively established. Results of ionization tests have been correlated with long-time life tests and service experience. As a result, it now is possible to use the ionization test as a valuable guide in selecting improved dielectric materials, and in designing to meet new operating conditions. While this paper refers specifically to the very thin dielectrics used in capacitors, the techniques described can be applied also to evaluate electrical insulations for other devices."
"The magnetic fluid formed by mixing finely divided iron and oil has been used extensively for clutch service and to a lesser extensively for clutch service. This paper describes the use of the magnetic fluid in an absorption dynamometer. Design data are derived and a mechanical power indicating instrument is proposed."
"As a logical step in the trend toward achieving a minimum oil content but still retaining the advantages of the time-proved dead-tank construction a new 230- kv circuit breaker built around a novel design of tank has been developed. The extra volume of oil which contributes nothing to the insulation nor to the efficiency of the circuit breaker in interrupting performance has been eliminated and the required amount of oil reduced to the point where simplified methods of oil handling and maintenance procedures are possible. Design tests on the circuit breaker prove its adequacy in meeting design standards and extensive High Power Laboratory tests reveal a superior performance in interrupting fault and line-charging currents. The quantity of oil used and the design of the contacts is such as to permit a number of fault interruptions without maintenance operation."
"At first two special problems concerning magnetic amplifiers for self-balancing d-c potentiometers and d-c bridge networks are specified. Numerous basic circuits of simple magnetic amplifiers preferably utilizing feedback effects are classified and explained. Then different push-pull circuits of the balance detector type are described systematically. Some figures for single-stage and multistage amplifiers are quoted to indicate the performance obtained. Speed of response in magnetic amplifiers, the possibility of providing derivative feedback, and design procedure with respect to time lag are briefly considered."
"The 2-reaction theory, introduced first by Blondel and later expanded by others, is generally applied to the analysis of synchronous machines. This theory, however, can be used to analyze and calculate the performance of all types of electric machinery. In the following the 2-reaction theory is used: to derive the differential equations of a-c motors; to develop the steady state equations of a-c motors; to draw vector diagrams for a-c motors; to solve the steady state equations and find the currents and torques. The advantages of this method are: its simplicity; the exclusion of vagueness and ambiguity about certain signs; and it presents a unified method for the mathematical analysis of all electric machines."
"The development of a new design slip regulator for steel mill service is described. Emphasis was laid on the following features: 1. More compact design and reduction of weight; 2. Higher electrode efficiency; 3. Higher efficiency and more flexibility of the cooling system; 4. Improved operation and simplification of the regulating system; and 5. Better accessibility and lower maintenance."
"In the past decade, the use of thermal meters has increased rapidly for the measurement of demand. The measurement of kilovolt-ampere demand by thermal means has been an objective of the metering industry for years. A few years ago, a polyphase thermal-ampere demand meter was developed. Using such a meter as a basis, voltage compensation has been added. The result is a combination polyphase watthour and thermal kilovolt-ampere demand meter as described in this paper."
"Renewed interest in resonant neutral grounding makes it important to have available methods for predicting accurately voltages and currents under abnormal system conditions. In this paper are discussed solutions of subsequent faults on power systems, often called simultaneous faults; included are systems so grounded that a single line-to-ground fault is not a short circuit. Based on a general selection of line locations to be faulted, analyses are made by component methods and 3-phase methods. Each analysis treats representation of the system, unbalance, and measurements. It is concluded that the component methods are more applicable to large systems, while small systems are more satisfactorily studied by the 3-phase methods. Advantages and shortcomings of the various solutions are indicated."
"The fundamental possibilities of adapting the design of capacitors to meet the special stresses encountered in series capacitors are reviewed. The design of the Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget units in the Swedish State Power Board's series capacitor at Alfta and of a new 50,000-kva bank now under production is described Possibilites of future improvements are outlined."
"Improvements and new developments in both the communications and power fields have, for the most part, eliminated the need for transposing high-voltage power lines at close intervals. In many systems transpositions are made only at switchyards and substations. Geometric unbalance of untransposed power lines leads to residual ground currents in solidly grounded systems. Methods of reducing the residual ground currents to tolerable levels are investigated in this paper."
"A method is given whereby a transfer ratio that contains complex zeros can be realized by means of R-C (resistance-capacitance) ladder networks connected in parallel. It is an improvement on the method previously given by Guillemin in that fewer paralleled networks are required and the level of the transfer ratio is greater. The general procedure is (1) to convert the desired transfer ratio into the sum of several transfer ratios, each of which can be realized with a single ladder network, (2) to develop the theory of paralleling ladders, and (3) to develop the method of synthesis of the individual ladder networks in terms of a common driving-point admittance function."
"This is the discussion of a basically new electromagnetic device in which two stationary coils with no mutual inductance to each other in the ordinary definition of the term, transfer energy from one coil at one frequency to the other coil at a second frequency through the medium of a vector or field of flux which follows a lissajous locus or mode of motion. It is compared to rotary electromagnetic devices in which the more simple lissajous mode of motion or circle is used and to the transformer which has but one degree of freedom. Saturation of the core legs in sequence to become active, and alternating at a frequency different than the power source."
"A microwave radio system channelized by pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) has been developed to fulfill a need for a short-haul, low-cost communications link having a moderate traffic capacity. For such short-range operation the microwave equipment has been greatly simplified, eliminating many of the refinements necessary for trunk-line workings. The PAM multiplex terminal subdivides the 100-kc information band into eight 3,000-cycle voice bands, employing a 3-element binary counter as the time division distributor."
"Fundamentally, telephone traffic is the sum of accumulated holding times of switching channels. From this simple statement two important conclusions can immediately be drawn. First, that telephone traffic is completely equivalent to the length of occupancy of the switching channels; that it may be expressed in any convenient unit of time; and that the same traffic or occupancy can be made up by many calls of short holding times each, or a few calls of long holding times each, or in any conceivable mixture of these as long as the sum of the individual holding times add up to the total length of occupancy. Second, since a channel naturally cannot be occupied for more than one hour in any single hour, the traffic carried per channel in one hour cannot exceed one traffic unit. From this it is argued that any measurement of traffic can be reduced in the last analysis to the measurement of time, more specifically to the measurement of accumulated holding times. From the preceding it will be understood that the switch count process is a particular method of time measurement by sampling, and its accuracy can be appraised by comparison with direct measurement of time, for instance, by a clock, where the latter term is used in its broadest possible interpretation. If the laws governing the accuracy of peg count methods and holding time measurements are determined, we have the necessary tools available by which the accuracy of traffic measurements can be appraised. The former was recently studied and published by the author, who found that the commonly used peg counting methods provide an exactness well within that required for traffic measurements."
"Analysis of tube failures from industrial application has pointed up three principal sources of failure: (1) copper-glass seals are not strong enough to withstand handling by industrial maintenance people; (2) filament structures of the spring-tensioned type are not too reliable; (3) thin-walled copper anodes will not stand occasional overloads. Tubes have been designed which greatly increase tube life by eliminating failures of the above types. The use of thick kovar metal in glass seals will withstand about ten times the torsion of the conventional copper seals commonly used in transmitter tubes. A self-supporting filament structure not only eliminates the failures caused by filaments sticking in guides and annealing of the spring material, but maintains uniform tube characteristics throughout life. Data on a type ML-5658 20-kw tube shows less than 2 per cent change in static data after 10,000 hours of life. The use of copper anodes from four to eight times thicker than customary permits nearly 100 per cent increase in plate dissipation ratings without additional water flow. For use at normal plate dissipation, the anode temperature runs lower and scaling of the anode, with resultant anode puncture, is eliminated. Failure of tubes due to excessive cathode temperature cannot be reduced since evaporation of the cathode material is a physical reality which cannot be compromised. Instead of running a tube above ratings, a larger tube with greater cathode area must be used."
"In making economic comparisons of alternative facilities, decisions are required as to what operating and maintenance cost items are to be included in the comparisons. This paper suggests a criterion for making these decisions and lists several cost items that should be considered. Three companion papers treat other related cost problems.1,2,3"
"In this paper the 2-reaction theory of synchronous machine analysis has been extended to obtain a synthesis procedure for 3-phase reluctance motors. Experiments were made on a motor with a rotor especially designed and constructed to conform with the assumptions of the generalized 2-reaction theory. Results of a differential analyzer investigation formed the basis for a method for simultaneous steady-state and optimum transient synthesis. In the synthesis procedure presented, the assumption is made that the desirable pullout torque, load torque to be pulled into synchronism, load inertia, supply voltage, supply frequency, and desired motor speed are specified. Certain stator laminations are assumed to be available. The maximum flux density in the stator teeth and the maximum current density in the stator conductors also are specified. The synthesis procedure then aims at obtaining the optimum design using the available stator laminations."
"The results of the empirical and analytical methods are identical. Since the motor design data are not always easy to obtain, the motor time constant can be computed directly from the torque speed curve. It is interesting to note that the motor velocity constant is twice the carrier or excitation frequency. This fact is readily proved experimentally providing another check on the validity of the motor equation derivation. The system is thus basically nonlinear as shown by the sine function in the torque equation. To use this motor with phase control in a servo system requires that the error (difference between input and output of closed loop system) be transferred into a directly proportional amplified phase shift. The signal then applied to the motor must be of the form sin K1(θinput-θoutput) giving: Ts d2θo/dt2+dθo/dt=Ks sin K1(θinput-θoutput) where Ts is the over-all system time constant and Ks is system velocity constant. In a practical system employing phase shift control some means will have to be employed to cause the motor to exert maximum torque (90-degree phase shift) even when the quantity K1(θi-θo) is greater than 90 degrees. This is necessary in order to prevent false zeroes since the motor torque decrease when the phase shift across its terminals is greater than 90 degrees. This is probably one of the principal disadvantages of a system employing phase shift control."
"Basic studies in connection with the nature and method of detection of slot discharge phenomena in high-voltage stator windings are presented. Discharging is seen to result from a loss of electrical contact between conducting coil surfaces in the slot portions and the core. This gives rise to a relatively high energy capacitive discharge which may seriously degrade basic insulation if it continues unchecked. The several possible methods for detection and location of discharge in stator windings were studied. The development of the slot discharge analyzer is described. This is useful as a maintenance tool for the detection and location of slot surface discharging on high-voltage machine stator windings."
"A modified slot discharge detection method, which permits tests without Shutting down the machine or using auxilliary high-voltage test equipment, was investigated. The method involves connection of frequency sensitive equipment across all or part of the ntral impedance. Tests on eight vertical water wheel generators in the range of 20,000- to 40,000-kva capacity indicate that the method is generally applicable when there is a current transformer or some other impedance in the generator neutral."
"This paper indicates the value of a closed iron core reactor as a source of fundamental reactive kilovolt-amperes. The saturation of the core provides a sharp transition point and a steep rise in reactive kilovolt-amperes when operating in the neighborhood of saturation. A practical method of analysis is outlined which permits the design of these reactors with engineering accuracy. Also included is expegimental data on a commercial reactor of this type."
"This paper describes a line of air-break contactors made for controlling 100-horsepower to 3,000-horsepower motors on 2,400-, 4,160- and 4,800-volt systems. The design features compactness, accessibility, and long life. The arc-rupturing structure has a magnetic blowout and an arc chute which confines and interrupts the arc entirely within its boundaries for all currents which it is rated to interrupt."
"The first three sections of this paper present a brief description of the methods presently employed by synchronous motor designers to control the starting performance and select the field discharge resistance. Subsequent sections propose a system whereby the designer or the user of a synchronous motor may change the starting performance through selection of the proper field circuit resistance."
"A comparative evaluation of manual methods of resuscitation has been made possible by the development of a method for producing prolonged drug-induced apnea in normal human volunteers, using varying amounts of sodium pentothal and curare drugs. This renders the subject unconscious and unable to breathe, in which state he closely resembles the victim who requires artificial respiration. Tests on lung ventilation have revealed that all of the ``push-pull'' manual methods are two to three times as effective, as regards getting air in and out of the lungs, as the commonly used Schafer Method. Use of ``back-pressure'' instead of prone pressure almost doubles the ventilation with the Schafer Method. The Eve Rocking Method, a mechanical method, gives ventilatory volumes intermediary between the Schafer and the ``push-pull'' methods. The Pole-Top Method gives adequate ventilation and should be started immediately when a lineman requires artificial respiration. However, he should be lowered to the ground as soon as possible and one of the more efficient prone methods should be started. Tests on the circulatory effects of the methods have indicated that the Schafer Method was so inadequate that it had to be stopped in three out of nine cases because of the deteriorating condition of the subject. In each case one of the ``push-pull'' techniques was able to adequately sustain the subjects for full 15-minute test periods immediately before and after the Schafer test period which failed."
"The subject of this paper concerns the progress that has been made in the generation of electricity by steam and its distribution. It is significant that the two authors selected by your committee to discuss this subject are both power plant designers, and that their two working lifetimes cover the whole history of electric power generation since its beginning. That there has been progress in the electric power industry during this brief span of years is well illustrated by Figure 1, which shows that electrical residential rates on a national basis have a history of continuously lowering during the past 50 years while, at the same time, the cost index has been continuously rising. Where else than in the electric power industry can such a record of progress be shown?"
"The control characteristic of a self-saturated magnetic amplifier is dependent upon the magnetic properties of the core material. A method is outlined for the experimental determination of the control magnetization curve, a plot of the locus of the minor dynamic hysteresis loops, which may be used with a firing angle analysis to predict the performance of simple magnetic amplifiers with high-control circuit impedance."

"The University of Manchester, UK, computing machine is described. The computing machine represents the culmination of a research project of several years' standing. It seems appropriate to outline the various steps in the development of this project, since these have given the final machine its major characteristics. The project was initiated at the Telecommunications Research Establishment, Great Malvern, at the end of Worl War II. The development of radar had produced many new techniques, and it was natural to seek other fields for their application. The original store used the anticipation pulse system, but since then many other configurations have been tried. The one in favor at the moment is the defocusfocus system. The successful operation of a single cathode-ray-tube (CRT) store containing 1,024 digits for a period of hours during the autumn of 1947 finally set the main line of the design of the machine, since from then on it was clear that it would use cathode ray tube storage."
"This paper describes the engineering techniques used and evaluates the performance of the computer to date, with a brief reference to the types of problems being handled on the computer. The first computer of the type described now has been installed at the University of Manchester, UK, and the construction and testing of further similar machines is proceeding."
"The ERA 1101 computer is a singleaddress binary-system parallel computer using magnetic drum memory. The word length is 24 binary digits, equivalent to seven decimal digits plus sign. The logic is quite conventional. A machine instruction consists of an operation code plus one execution address. The execution. address usually specifies the location of an operand or the place where a result is to be stored. There are a total of 38 different operations possible. Various design considerations are detailed."
"The International Business Machines (IBM) Card-Programmed Electronic Calculator (CPC) demonstrates the advantages to be gained from constructing a large calculator of proved, mass-produced units; from utilizing a pluggable control panel for flexibility; from input and output via standard media; from external programming for an intermediate sgeed machine; from a measure of parallel operation; and from line-printing output operating simultaneously with computing. The authors describe the arithmetic unit with its pluggable control panel, the storage units and their interconnections, timing, and overall operation of the CPC, sequencing, parallel operations and output."
"THE ORDVAC is a general purpose machine which has been built by the University of Illinois, IL, USA, for the Ballistic Research Laboratories at Aberdeen, Maryland. The design has followed in a general way that of the computing machine discussed by Burks, Goldstine, and von Neumann in the \"Preliminary Discussion of the Logical Design of an Electronic Computing Instrument\" issued in 1946 by the Institute for Advanced Study. Design considerations are detailed. The work on the ORDVAC started in the spring of 1949 and has been supported by a contract from the Ordnance Department for $250,000. The University of Illinois has provided a comparable sum which is to lead to a second machine. The Ordnance contract was concluded on October 31, 1951 and since that time the ORDV AC has been under test. It is currently expected that it will be moved to the Ballistic Research Laboratories at Aberdeen about February 1952. Its presence at the University until then allows a further understanding of its operation and use, and aids in the work on the machine for the University of Illinois."
"In June of 1948 the US National Bureau of Standards acting on behalf of the Bureau of the Census contracted with the Eckert-Mauch1y Computer Corporation for a UNIVAC System. This UNIVAC System, now generally known as the Census UNIVAC System, was accepted on March 30, 1951, and since that time has been devoted almost exclusively to tabulating results of the 1950 Census of Population and Housing. We will try to present here certain facts about the acceptance testing and about operating experience. We also will indicate the inferences we have drawn from these facts. We are aware that any given body of facts may be, and often is, interpreted in a variety of ways depending upon just what it is that the interpreter is trying to prove. We will try carefully, therefore, to distinguish between our facts and our inferences. Furthermore, we will try to present the extremes of the conclusions that might be drawn from the facts. One of the authors is an engineer with some familiarity with the difficulties of physically realizing the grand promises frequently made for, and not always by, engineers. The other author is in the business of producing statistics. He is interested in any tool that will increase the efficiency with which he conducts this business. For purposes of this paper, at least, each of them does his best to be a good advocate for his 'devil.'"
"The Research Division of the Burroughs Adding Machine Company has built a large-scale digital computer which is unique in that the internal mechanization of computational steps can be changed merely by reconnection of plug-in cables. Construction from already designed general-purpose building blocks, known as pulse control units, resulted in an unusually short time (9 months) between the decision to design the computer and its realization. As implied by its name, the Laboratory Computer is a laboratory device whose most important function is to assist in a long-range development program of wide scope by providing a versatile proving ground for the trial and evaluation of new ideas and components. It is a useful source of engineering performance data, and has proved valuable as a means for training personnel. Although problem solution has been regarded as a subsidiary objective, useful results have been obtained from the machine. Initially its computational ability was modest, but recent enhancements have substantially increased its potential. These alterations have not yet been exploited to any great degree. Basic limitations on its performance as a computer are the rotational speed of the magnetic drum, the only intern a memory medium, and the speed of standard teletype terminal facilities. If further improved storage and terminal equipment becomes available it can readily be added to the system. after first being equipped with necessary transducer circuitry. Plans for the future continue to subjugate problem solution to use of the machille as a development tool."
"The author's purpose is to provide a background, first for meetings like this on subjects dealing with computers, and second, for this particular meeting. This meeting is sponsored by the Joint AlEE-IRE Computer Committee, with assistance from the Association for Computing Machinery. It is a direct outgrowth of the successsful meeting a year ago at Atlantic City, NJ, USA, on electron tubes for computers. A review of life in the field of large-scale digital computers will make it clear how timely this meeting is. The author points out four phases of life in this field. The phases were preceded by a period of pioneering, in which a relatively small number of people developed computers such as the ENIAC and the MARK I calculator. The first phase is called the future, or building, or talking phase. The common denominator was a remark somewhat like this: \"What a wonderful critter our computer is going to be.\" The second phase is what might be called the subjunctive, or debugging, or possibly the silent phase. The remarks that people made in this phase were, \"It sure would be nice if we could get this thing to work.\" The third phase is the present, or working, or bright-look phase, and the remarks that people made at this time were, \"Our computer is working now, but we haven't had enough experience to judge it properly.\" The fourth I have called the past or getting-results phase. This again is a talking phase, and people tend to say nowadays, \"It has been working fine; we are glad we built it, hut we wish we had done this and this instead of what we actually did. However, we are going to fix that in our new model, and besides we are going to make it a lot simpler and more reliable.\" It is because of this latter phase that we have scheduled this meeting now. Computer people have had enough experience to judge the large machines that they have produced, and it is appropriate to take stock now, before people get too far along on the new round of machines which is being started."
"In March 1951, the first UNIVAC system formally passed its acceptance tests and was put promptly into operation by the Bureau of the Census. Since the UNIVAC is the first computer which can handle both alphabetic and numerical data to reach full-scale operation so far, its operating record and a review of the types of problems to which it has been applied provide an interesting milestone in the ever-widening field of electronic digital computers. The entire UNIVAC system is constructed of circuits which are as conservative as is consistent with the desired reliability and speeds of operation. The circuits have been designed as building blocks and the entire computer is constructed around these blocks."

"The Bell Telephone Laboratories have designed and built seven digital computers since the late 1930s. The seven types made were all electro-mechanical types using telephone systems relays and teletype transmitting and recording devices as their principal apparatus elements. Starting with the \"complex number computer\" as the pioneer and with the Model VI as its latest achievement, the Bell Laboratories computer development has spanned the pre-electronic computer development era. The seven types, known by Model numbers (with Model I being the designation of the complex number computer) are described. Two Model V computers were built. A table is provided that shows some statistical information about their size and use. The Models V and VI, although operating at electromechanical speed, offer several challenges to current electronic computers. While the same cannot be said of the Models I through IV, nevertheless, they have features of interest, which are described herein."
"The author presents a user's critical view of computing machinery in aircraft engineering with emphasis on its limitations. He concludes that our engineering use of computing machinery has progressively increased in scope and magnitude during these past six years. At the beginning of that period we applied machine methods on a very modest scale. We did so in the hope that it would be the eventual means of breaking our major design bottleneck- the ever growing volume of mathematical investigation demanded by modern aircraft. Machine computing has been at least partially successful in accomplishing that purpose. The scale of our operations has grown naturally from its tentative beginnings to the point that machine computing is definitely indispensable now. It is becoming increasingly vital at a startling rate. Computing machines are themselves an engineering product. It is entirely likely that, in their ultimate development, the engineering profession itself will be the biggest user of that product."
"Project Whirlwind is a high-speed computer activity sponsored at the Digital Computer Laboratory, formerly a part of the Servomechanisms Laboratory, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by the US Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the United States Air Force. The project began in 1945 with the assignment of building a highquality real-time aircraft simulator. Historically, the project has always been primarily interested in the fields of real-time simulation and control; but since about the beginning of 1947 most of its efforts have been devoted to the design and construction of the, digital computer known as Whirlwind I (WWI). This computer has been in operation for about 1 year and an increasing proportion of project effort now is going into application studies. Whirlwind I was designed for use in control and simulation work such as air traffic control, industrial process control, and aircraft simulation. Various design and synthesis issues are presented. [Note: Discussion of this paper was combined with that of the following paper: \"Evaluation of the Engineering Aspects of Whirlwind I.\"]"

"IN THE ORDINARY application of power circuit breakers, the most desirable method of operation consists of d-c solenoid mechanisms for closing and tripping, supplied by a storage battery. When this is not suitable, the next choice is a dry metallic rectifier for closing from some a-c source and either current transformers or a capacitor device for a-c tripping. In some applications requiring only a single isolated circuit breaker, these methods of operation may not be desirable because of battery maintenance or because an auxiliary control transformer for a rectifier supply would have to be connected to the incoming line ahead of the circuit breaker."
"THE EARLIEST, and most direct, method of analyzing automatic control systems is based on the solution of the differential equations of the system for some initial disturbance. This transient analysis is general and, seemingly, may be applied to any problem which can be formulated in differential equations. However, even with the aid of the powerful methods of the Laplace transformation, synthesis of a complex control is largely a cut-and-try process."
"Fluid mapper techniques are well enough developed so that many fields can now be simulated accurately by applying tested routines to building and operating the mappers. Like all other devices, they have their own special problems, troubles, and limitations.' Further invention, research, and development of additional techniques are needed."
"Since the discovery of magnetic resonance in solids, liquids, and gases in 1945, the phenomenon has been used in the determination of nuclear magnetic moments and magnetic field strengths, as well as in the study of crystal structure and relaxation times."
"A BROADENING application field for the President's Conference Car (PCC)-type electric car has introduced new and more severe requirements in the design of its propulsion equipment. This has resulted in a new raction motor embodying the latest progress in design and manufacture, and particularly suited to dynamic braking at the high operating speeds currently coming into vogue. The application of the PCG car to high-speed tuburban service, and the utilization of the same propuision equipment for lightweight rapid transit service, have set the stage for a redesign of this equipment to meet the new performance demands. Whereas a speed of 35 miles per hour was rarely exceeded in city service, speeds of 0 miles per hour and above may be expected in rapid transit and suburban operation. Coincident with the increase in top speed is the requirement that dynamic braking be made available from these speeds without injury to the motor from overvoltage."
"THE PROBLEM of obtaining selective tripping of feeder circuit interrupters on d-c traction systems is an old one which has challenged the ingenuity of design engineers for many years. The ideal operating condition is one that keeps the feeder circuit breaker closed under all conditions of normal loads and quickly opens the interrupter when a short circuit occurs on its circuit, all other interrupters remaining closed."
"EVERY ENGINEER has a job to do that is not directly related to the project that he is working on, but which is important to the prestige of the engineering profession. That job is to let the layman know what he is doing, why he is doing it, and what the results would be of he failed to do it. In other words, publicity is an extra-curricular part of an engineer's responsibility."
"A full automatic teletypewriter message switching system has been developed for use in private line networks involving one or more switching centers and a multiplicity of local or long distance lines, each of which may have one or more stations. This system provides fast teletypewriter communication from any station to any other station or group of stations in the network."
"THE INSTRUMENTATION presented here was developed to measure the magnitude of some of the factors affecting contact wear, so that the effects of these factors may be evaluated. The ultimate goal is to be able to use these instruments to determine the contact life of a specific design in a few hours, instead of the usual weeks or months required for the life-testing methods now used."
"In a study of newly developed arsenical-lead alloys for sheathing of underground power cables, it has been found that these alloys are superior to copper-bearing alloys in the following aspects: withstanding bending caused by thermal expansion, resistance to creep caused by internal pressures, and life-to-fracture under tensile stress."
"A study has been made of magnetic alloys which have a nearly rectangular hysteresis loop. This characteristic is desirable for materials used in saturable reactors, magnetic amplifiers, pulse transformers, and other nonlinear circuit elements."
"THE PRESENCE of harmonics in an a-c circuit, inductively coupled to a telephone system, may cause interference with the transmission of sound. As the result of a series of tests, a meter to measure Telephone Influence Factor (TIF), commonly called a TIF meter, was developed. The admittance characteristic of this meter, for various frequencies, is proportional to the values in the curve and tabulation in Figure 1. Quantitatively, TIF for any frequency, or combination of frequencies, is equal to the microamperes per volt input, as measured by this meter. TIF for 60 cycles is 1. As will be noticed from the curve, a frequency of 1,070 cycles has 12,000 times the interfering effect of a 60-cycle fundamental of the same amplitude. By use of a harmonic analyzer, the contribution of each component to the total TIF may be determined."
"THIS ARTICLE discusses the test equipment which has been added to the test facilities of the 500-kv experimental lines, the verification of the accuracy of the corona loss instrumentation, and the techniques of analysis and reduction of data which have been developed."
"IN ELECTRONIC digital computers information is stored in registers, which consist of a number of bistable circuits, usually called flip-flops. During the operation of the computer it frequently is necessary to transfer the information from one register to another. In parallel computers the information is transferred simultaneously from all flip-flops along parallel routes. The apparatus which causes the second, or slave register, to be set according to the first, or master register, is called a gate, and the operation is that of reading or gating the master into the slave."
"A study of the power supply to the United Electric Railways was initiated when new construction necessitated the relocation of rotary converters. The question of replacement with more modern equipment and feeder and trolley system losses was studied by the use of probability methods."
"Recent spectroscopic investigations by the National ireau of Standards (NBS) give positive identification of two :\\v artificial elements. Not found in nature, the elements :hnetium (Tc) and promethium (Pm) are by-products of anium fission; they were supplied by the Atomic Energy Dmmission. Studies at the NBS of the first optical spectra these elements have revealed many properties of the atoms id their nuclei. They also have provided reliable wavengths and intensity data for about 5,000 new spectral lines. In 1949 the NBS received from the Oak Ridge National iboratory several milligrams of each of these fission prodts for the purpose of making reliable descriptions and analyse of the spectra characteristic of these artifical eleents. Four milligrams of highly pure Tc were used to mtograph arc and spark emission spectra with a large difiction grating. The spectra were recorded several times m 2,200 to 9,000 angstroms, and between these limits the avelengths and relative intensities of about 2,300 radia- )ns characteristic of Tc atoms and ions were determined. While comparing intensities in arc and spark excitation, the les could be assigned definitely either to neutral Tc atoms to singly ionized atoms."
"The pertinence of the differential analyser to the solution of certain types of electrical problems is explained by citing three examples. These examples have to do with magnetic amplifiers, pulse transformers, and particle (electron) accelerators."
"SINCE turbine-generator rotors are highly stressed structures that combine materials of widely varying properties, unbalance may be caused by geometrical errors, non-homogeneity of materials, or distortion under the speed and temperature of operating conditions. The purpose of balancing is to offset these imperfections by adjustment of the rotor mass distribution so as to secure a rotor which will run so smoothly that only small periodic forces will be transmitted to the supporting bearings and foundation."
"As the telemetering art progresses under the impetus of both aircraft and industrial needs, the requirement for accurate transducing becomes more and more important. This article describes a null-balance type of transducer which is inherently capable of achieving an accuracy comparable to that of present-day transmission links."
"THE FUNCTION of many industrial regulating systems is to hold some process quantity reasonably constant in the face of a diversity of disturbances which would otherwise cause that quantity to vary with time in an unacceptable manner. While such systems operate by developing corrective measures which are of opposite sign to the errors in the regulated quantity, the reference quantity, which is usually thought of as the standard of comparison, frequently does not appear explicitly."
"THIS ANALYSIS deals with saturable reactors whose core material can be approximated by a rectangular magnetization curve. Such response is analyzed with respect to changes of control voltage, supply voltage, and load resistance. Operating in the proportional region, the response of the load current to any of the previous changes is an exponential function, governed by a single time constant, which varies with the load and inversely with control-circuit resistance and line frequency."
"A special surge circuit has been developed for use in power interruption testing of lightning arresters. This circuit consists of a power source, a surge circuit, and an impulse timing circuit."
"A simple and inexpensive process for resharpening sapphire, stellite, and steel recording styli has been revealed. The method involves immersing the stylus in a sodium hydroxide solvent instead of regrinding the tool."
"At the end of his talk on Heaviside's operators in engineering and physics in which he introduced the unit function, the time differentiator p, the “resistance operators” for the circuit constants, and the operational forms of nusoidal functions of time, the engineer from the land of sure electrical constants invited his listeners to submit their network problems to him and he then would solve them as in illustration of his talk. One of the problems submitted from the floor may be called a distortion network and may be described as follows:"
"Southwestern Michigan's electric power supply was increased 135,000 horsepower recently with the starting up of a new steam turbogenerator at Detroit Edison's Conners Creek power plant. The 100,000-kw machine produces enough electricity to supply a city of 215,000 people. The turbogenerator cost approximately $15,000,000 and is the first of two identical units being installed at Conners Creek. The second will go into operation in September. Both were built by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. The new generating unit weighs more than 800 tons. Steam enters the turbine at 950 degrees Fahrenheit and at a pressure of 1,300 pounds. The boilers can generate 600,000 pounds of steam per hour. The condenser requires 74,000 gallons per minute of cooling water, which is pumped directly from the Detroit River and then returned, purified, to the river. Addition of the Conners Creek generator is one step in an expansion program that will bring Detroit Edison's total power capacity to 3,000,000 horsepower by 1953."

"This description of the latest a-c multiple-unit car equipment to go into service on the Pennsylvania Railroad reviews the features which have been incorporated to provide motors and control at a reasonable cost, with adequate margin for the service, and which are expected to result in major economies in operation over the years. The possibility of reducing costs of multiple-unit cars by the use of Ignitron-rectifier motive power to effect standardization of traction also is discussed in this article."
"The N.R.X. Nuclear Reactor at Chalk River, Ontario, has been operating for 3&frac1s2; years. Beside investigations on this experimental reactor itself, research is being conducted with the radiations. This may be divided into technological research for atomic-energy purposes and pure research in physics and radioactive chemistry."
"AS A RESULT of study and experimental work, a present-day shaded pole motor with good accelerating characteristics and 35- to 40-per cent efficiency is not uncommon. With improved efficiency, the horsepower ratings of these motors are also extended from the sub fractional to the fractional range. Experimental results reading to this improvement can be co-ordinated and integrated into infallible rules for designing shaded pole motors with the aid of the equivalent circuit."
"AIR BLAST circuit breakers were selected recently for a metropolitan station requiring circuit breakers rated 69 kv, 2,000 amperes and capable of interrupting 3,500 megavolt amperes within five cycles. This installation forms part of an outdoor metal-enclosed switchgear equipment and a metal-enclosed circuit-breaker design was desired."
"A study of radio influence has been made on 500-kv test lines. The effects of weathering, precipitation, variations in voltage, frequency, and conductor diameter were all investigated."
"REPEATER fuses have been used by the Northern Indiana Public Service Company for sectionalizing distribution lines for the last 15 years. Studies have been made for all districts, and single line maps have been prepared for distribution to the various operating departments showing the location and recommended fuse link size for all sectionalizing points."
"Many advances have been made in the study of ferromagnetic ferrites in the past few years. This article discusses the Neel theory, in both the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic regions, and consequences and proof of the Neel theory."
"The range of frequencies for which a meter can be used within given error limits has been increased nearly tenfold. This has been accomplished by compensating the meter with a capacitor shunting its series resistance; the value of the capacitor is determined by a rigorous solution of the meter circuit."
"A-C DIELECTRIC-LOSS TESTS: TEST TECHNIQUES based on dielectric measurements at operating frequency, originally developed for higher voltage insulations, have been applied to the insulation of generator coils. The volt-ampere requirements of the test voltage source may be reduced materially by resonating the capacitance of the generator winding with a variable high-voltage inductor."
"THE CONTINUOUS operation of large synchronous machines and freedom from failures in service is of vital interest to every electric utility company. One of the major causes of unpredicted and unscheduled outage is the failure of stator coil insulation."
"Microwave communication is becoming increasingly important in many industries. Many factors must be considered in the establishment of a microwave system; they include the selection of a frequency band, location of terminal sites, and calculation of free-space loss and other losses between equipment terminals."
"WITH THE increased use of inert-gas arc welding, especially in automatic welding machines, problems of arc ignition and stability become important. New electrodes much more satisfactory than the conventional type have been developed by using the highly refractory oxides, thoria and zirconia, in combination with tungsten and other materials. The conventional welding electrode is of some nonconsumable material, usually tungsten, and starting is accomplished either by contact or by a high-frequency spark. When spark starting is used, ignition may be quite erratic, depending on the previous history of the tungsten electrode. If the electrode is cold, the arc may not form immediately or at all, and, when formed, it may be extremely mobile, with the footpoint moving rapidly over the tungsten surface. In an automatic setup, this type of behavior can lead to losses in both time and material. See Figure 1. This shows the effect on the work of slow starting and arc wander. Also, the welding torch may be damaged. With the new electrode, instant starting and a highly stable arc are obtained. The arc picks up at lower open-circuit voltage and the current ranges are extended."
"THE LARGEST 60-cycle transformer core ever made is now in successful operation on a 300,000,000-volt betatron at the University of Illinois. If this core were used for an oil-immersed power transformer, windings for continuous operation at 2,000,000 kva could be placed on it. Construction of this core demonstrates the feasibility of constructing transformers many times as large as have been built to take advantage of lower cost per kilovolt ampere and increased efficiency. Cores several times as large as this one can be made employing similar construction. Shipping clearances limit the size and weight of transformers which can be assembled in a factory and shipped to their destination. These limitations can be removed by assembling transformers in the field."
"EQUATIONS AND equivalent circuits are developed for the shaded-pole motor, including the space-harmonics introduced by the stator windings. Uneven air gap, also excitation on the shaded pole, are assumed, while the parameters include the angle of shift and the ratio of turns. The equations and equivalent circuits cover both the cross-field and the revolving-field theories."
"The mathematical training of an engineering student should be designed to meet his current and future needs. College faculties should consider carefully the needs which are common to all and should stress the importance of application in the teaching of general courses."
"CHARACTERISTICS of fuses generally are given by curves in which overload current is plotted against the time required to blow the fuse. This relationship is necessary for most applications, but where the fuses are called upon to protect a device which is recurringly overloaded and unloaded, the characteristics are not useful. Examples of a recurring load exist in the resistance welding field where the welding machine draws up to four to five times its thermal rating during the welding period. Rating sheets for welders and ignitron tubes used with welders can best be expressed in terms of current and duty cycle. Since the welding industry is acquainted with rating sheets of this type, it is desirable to have rating sheets for fuses used in this industry expressed in the same terms."
"In order to pick the proper power transformer for a certain application many factors must be taken into account. Each transformer location on each system must be considered separately in the light of these factors."
"The first of a series of air-raid tests was recently conducted in Rockefeller Center, New York City, to study the efficiency of personnel and equipment under simulated airraid conditions. The test brought into action a representative portion of the Center's civilian defense plan. The total organization includes more than 1,000 volunteers, and utilizes a wide variety of special equipment, including the use of Motorola frequency-modulated 2-way “Handie-Talkie” portable radiophones and Pack Sets which were recently purchased to permit instantaneous contact between points anywhere on the 12-acre development. Plans call for distribution of the sets throughout the various buildings, which will enable defense instructions to be circulated throughout the Center's 15 buildings. The recent test marked the first application of a comprehensive civilian defense program which was instituted last August with the formation of a 6-man civilian defense committee for the Center."
"A COMPARATIVELY low-cost nonbroadcast wired system especially adapted to manufacturing, merchandising, medicinal, and military fields has been developed around the image orthicon pickup tube."
"Trigger cell behavior results from the occurrence of n-type and p-type germanium in the same crystal, so arranged that both are in the contact circuit. This photocell is especially well adapted for use in the field of on-off devices and, as its on-current is high enough to develop useful power in low resistances, it can actuate short-time constant computer circuits without preamplifiers and cathode followers."
"ANEW TYPE OF synthetic resin-bonded mica tape insulation has been developed for high-voltage machine stator windings and is being applied widely to turbine generators. This new insulation has improved physical, electrical, and thermal properties as compared to earlier forms of high-voltage machine insulation. The insulation consists of multiple layers of continuous mica tape impregnated with a solventless heat-reactive resin."
"LOAD GROWTH in 1947 in the Washington, D. C., area necessitated starting construction of a generating station in Alexandria, Va., approximately four miles south of the territory served by the Potomac Electric Power Company. The ultimate capacity of this station is five 80,000-kw 85-per cent power factor machines to be placed on the line at approximately 1-year intervals. Intervening air fields and park territory rendered overhead transmission impractical and the problem became one of underground cable. For economical reasons, it was decided to install cable capacity for each generator as it became available."
"INTEREST in extending the hook-on technique to measurement of 3-phase power factor has resulted in the development of a hook-on power factor meter. Prerequisites were light weight, simple operation, and wide range (0 to 1.0 power factor lead and lag, 100 to 600 volts, 15 to 600 amperes)."
"The purpose of this investigation was to study the protection provided by lightning arresters of different protective ability located various distances from the protected apparatus. Quantitative correlations of basic impulse insulation levels and surge voltages are not considered."
"IN A STUDY of “activated tank” ship stabilization, an unusually difficult flowmetering problem was encounered. As conventional methods were not adequate it was necessary to resort to an electromagnetic flowmeter."
"A scheme for providing power electronically for large d-c contact testing has been devised. This power source provides characteristics which are quite acceptable for testing up to 10,000 amperes at 250 volts; it is less expensive than rotating equipment, has a voltage range from 250 to 750 volts, and takes less space than rotating equipment."
"Instant and quick-start circuits now on the market for use with fluorescent lamps include the series or sequence type as well as high-frequency-circuits. New designs may lead to smaller ballasts or to a self-starting lamp which will start instantly with present switch-start fixtures."

"A 3-day meeting of the Southern District and a Student Branch Conference took place at Miami Beach, Fla., April 11–13, with headquarters in The Mac Fadden- Deauville Hotel. There were four technical sessions and two student sessions in the mornings. Inspection trips and sight-seeing tours were taken during the afternoons. Entertainment included a luncheon and a buffet supper and aquacade on Wednesday and a banquet on the following day. On the business side, an all-day meeting of the Board of Directors took place on Thursday, followed by a conference of student branch counsellors Friday morning. The registered attendance was 328 members and guests and 93 students."
"To conduct more effectively the technical activities, the Institute for several years has been organized in five major technical divisions : communications, general applications, industry, power, and science and electronics. The areas encompassed by each division are defined most readily by a listing of the technical committees in each of the divisions. This has been done on the reverse side of a questionnaire on technical division publications recently sent to all members. For convenience, the questionnaire has been made up in five parts."
"The board of examiners, at its recent meeting recommended the members listed for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objection to these transfers should be filed at once with the national secretary."
"The first coast-to-coast dial call by a telephone subscriber will be made this fall.

"To industry, electric power is the power to progress. It is the power to produce more goods and services with a given number of men. The Institute also has the power to progress by advancing electrical engineering as the key to the electrical industry."
"An underwater repeater recently installed in one of the early transatlantic telegraph cables more than tripled the operating speed of the cable. This development, coming at the centenary of the submarine cable, is expected to have wide application."
"THE PERFORMANCE of a servomechanism is often improved by modifying the data signal with compensation networks. For a-c servomechanisms, a-c (sometimes termed carrier-frequency) compensation networks are employed which modify only the modulation, because the data appear as modulation on a carrier. To determine the effect on the data signal of such an a-c compensation network, let us examine the action of the 2-phase motor as a demodulator."
"IN CONJUNCTION with basic studies of a-c and d-c test methods to evaluate the conditions of machine insulations, a number of dielectric absorption tests were made on new high-voltage stator windings using d-c test voltages ranging from 5,000 to 40,000 volts. A total of 78 machines rating from 15,000 to 135,000 kva were tested. Because the application of high-potential d-c test voltages is necessarily limited to machines whose insulation is capable of withstanding such voltages without damaging effects, the voltage class of all of the machines tested was in the range of 11.0 to 14.4 kv. The insulation was essentially the same for the entire group of machines consisting of multiple layers of continuously applied mica tape."
"Microwave equipment uses the same kinds of parts applied in the same general manner as in low-frequency equipment. However, because of the wide frequency spectrum available, realizable antenna gains, propagation characteristics, and economic considerations, microwave equipment is widely different from low-frequency equipment in design and application."
"All types of electronic cores made from iron powder and commonly in use by the radio and television industry have been listed in a new standard released by the Metal Powder Association. The standard was prepared by the Electronic Core Subcommittee of the Metal Powder Association Standards Committee to meet a need long felt in industry for standardization of the dimensions and tolerances of electronic cores. The standard, designated 11–51T, defines the terms commonly associated with electronic cores made from powdered magnetic materials and specifies the preferred dimensions of standard sizes and shapes. Preferred dimensions are listed in detail for plain iron cores, insert iron cores, threaded iron cores, tuning cores, and sleeve iron cores. Data are provided also for concentricity, screwdriver slot dimensions, and hexagonal hole sizes as well as threaded-spring type and spaded-insert sizes."
"WELL-PLANNED execution of a practical test program results in a maximum of equipment-operating efficiency through utilization of a minimum of test man power, equipment, and expense. The objective is to determine the extent of insulation deterioration and then take remedial measures against failure of the equipment."
"AMONG THE methods for predetermining the stability of networks—that is, whether or not self-sustained oscillations may exist—the Barkhausen and Nyquist criteria often are applied to those configurations employing electron-tube amplifiers for which a principal closed transmission loop may be delineated. In these networks the concept of “retroaction” or feedback is useful, since this provides a mental picture of a signal progressing unidirectionally through the electron tube, the feedback network, back to the tube input, and so on. It also leads to a simple scheme for computing the ratio (often denoted by μβ) of output to input voltage for the open transmission loop, upon which the stability of the network apparently rests. However, these criteria are limited to unilaterally transmitting networks, and the determination of μβ must be made, in effect, with the transmission loop cut at zero admittance grid-cathode terminals of an electron tube."
"The electrical engineering curriculum of 25 years ago is compared with that of today. The differences in 60-cycle and high-frequency training are presented and stress is laid on the need for training of electronics in the fundamental area."
"THE USE OF Fourier's method for analysis of complex waves, whether they be electric, mechanical, or aural in nature, is well known. A device which could produce a variety of complex waves could be used to check tedious computations or even to apply a desired complex wave to a system in order to observe its response. Such a device is the subject of this article."
"PRIOR TO the acquisition of new or improved types of railroad motive power and at times when track or other improvements are contemplated, it is customary to calculate the performance of a typical train over a specified route. The usual step-by-step calculations of train performance are tedious and require considerably more time than a train would need to operate over the same route."
"The rare combination of a theoretician and a practical engineer was found in Giovanni Giorgi. His theory of alternating sinusoidal currents and their representation by means of vector diagrams is fundamental to the science of engineering. At the same time he planned and organized many civic engineering projects for the benefit of his people."
"This 66,700-kva water wheel generator soon will be producing electric power for the city of Seatde, Wash., in the rapidly growing Pacific Northwest. It is being constructed at the East Pittsburgh, Pa., plant of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. It will be installed in the Gorge power house which is located on the Skagit River above Seattle."
"The Peltier effect has long been neglected by electrical engineers. Lately, however, experiments have been made on new alloys to determine the practicability of using the Peltier effect in a thermoelectric power generator."
"A new winding insulation tester has been built which extends the application of this type of apparatus to cover low-impedance windings. With this new tester weak insulation on large d-c armatures can be detected, so that design and manufacturing techniques can be improved."
"THIS INVESTIGATION was suggested when it was observed that gaps in high direct-voltage equipment exhibited erratic and rather low breakdown strength during moderately high humidity conditions. Electrode edges were slightly rough in some of the gaps."
"ONE OF THE first 34.5-kv capacitor banks in this country was installed recently on the Indianapolis Power and Light Company system. This capacitor bank, totaling 7,290 kva, was part of a system program of adding reactive generation close to reactive load in the most practical and economical manner. See Figures 1 and 2."
"A THERMAL anemometer with unusual sensitivity, accuracy, and ruggedness has been developed for laboratory and industrial use. It operates from a heated noble metal thermopile which is placed in the airstream whose velocity is to be measured. The anemometer is practically independent of temperature over a considerable range since both the hot and cold junctions are exposed to the airstream and are equally affected by ambient temperature. Radiation effects tend to cancel in the same manner. Thermopile probes of suitably chosen materials have been used satisfactorily at temperatures as low as — 65 degrees Fahrenheit and to above 300 degrees Fahrenheit. The outstanding feature of this anemometer is that the transient thermal voltage produced in the heated thermopile by sudden changes in ambient temperature is counterbalanced by the equal and opposite transient thermal voltage of an unheated thermopile located in the probe and exposed to the airstream whose velocity is being measured. This arrangement compensates completely for rate of change of temperature."
"Studies have been made to determine the most desirable motors to be used for oil-well pumping. From consideration of the type of load, starting requirements, cost, and operating conditions it was found that high-torque motors with 5- to 8-per cent slip will give best service on polyphase lines and 2-value capacitor-type motors will be best on single-phase lines."
"AS MORE and more telephones are converted to dial, the elimination of operators presents the problem of automatically preparing billing information for toll calls between dial exchanges. A practical solution appeared to be an automatic ticketing trunk on which a billing record can be prepared at the same time as the connection is established."
"THERMAL TRANSIENTS on cables have an important bearing on the emergency rating of a cable, a matter which is receiving increasing attention because of its economic as well as its technical importance."
"THE INDUCTION motor with unbalanced rotor resistances was first studied by Hans Goerges more than 50 years ago.1 Early investigations were concerned with one particular phase of the problem: the single-phase rotor. It was found that the wound-rotor motor with one rotor phase opened could be operated stably near half-speed, either as motor or generator. A singular feature noted by Goerges was that the efficiency of the motor with single-phase rotor was much higher than that of the balanced motor operated at the same speed with external resistances. Subsequent study of the problem has been motivated by the need for a simple method of speed control. Rotor unbalance has had to be considered in the application of resistance controllers for speed variation and starting, because this equipment usually is unbalanced at many of the stepped positions."
"Ninety per cent of the service interruptions of ENIAC at Aberdeen Proving Ground are caused by vacuum-tube failures. A 5-month tube surveillance program was conducted wherein faulty tubes were detected and replaced. How such tubes were tested and their histories gathered is described together with the preliminary findings."
"Low-temperature radiant-panel heating offers a possible solution to the problem of house heating by electricity. Some of the technical and economic aspects are discussed."
"PRESENT-DAY economics indicate the practicability of long-distance a-c power transmission in many localities for distances greater than 300 miles. One of the important characteristics of such a transmission system is its steady-state stability limit. That is, at some particular steady-state load and system condition, when the synchronous machine is still able to supply more power across the line, the system nevertheless loses synchronism. This is interpreted physically to mean that the generator has no longer enough synchronizing torque to keep it in synchronism against small disturbances that continually arise."
"THIS ARTICLE presents data on the variation of the synchronizing and damping torque coefficients of a synchronous machine as affected by hunting frequency, reactance and resistance of the system to which the machine is connected, and characteristics of the rotor circuits, load, and field excitations. The data are presented not only as being of value in themselves but also to call attention to a straightforward method of calculation which has been available for a long time.1"
"Efficient and economical utilization of oriented cold-rolled steel requires that magnetic flux traverse the steel in the rolling direction; the effects of joints be reduced; and strains in the finished core be minimized. Reductions in core loss, exciting current, and noise level are being obtained in routine production units of Spirakore transformers using these principles"
"A new expanded plastic for use in making life rafts, life ring buoys, and other flotation equipment was announced recently by the United States Rubber Company. The product is honeycombed with millions of tiny nonconnecting cells which make it extremely light. It is not affected by sun or salt water, and will stay afloat indefinitely. Other applications for the new plastic are for sun helmets and commercial fishing floats."
"METHODS OF DESIGN, described previously for the reluctance motor, present a design procedure which results in three major steps. The three steps are: (1) choose trial dimensions and windings, (2) calculate the motor constants, and (3) calculate the performance of the trial design. Previous articles have described the method of choosing the optimum dimensions, calculating the constants and the performance. No method has been described which allows the designer to choose the correct number of turns and the wire size for a given or specified performance."
"This article discusses the principles of metal wall thickness measurement from one side and an instrument for making such measurements. The selection of quartz crystal and range, accuracy, and limitations of the method are covered."
"Sensitive relays often can be used in process control where conventional controllers are impractical or too expensive. This article outlines some of the design factors that must be considered when using these relays and gives some typical circuits."
"High power magnetrons are used at the ultrahigh frequencies for fast dielectric heating. One such tube, generating 5 kw at 915 megacycles, and associated control circuits are described."

"A self-contained automatic weather station, which transmits weather data by radio on a frequency of five megacycles at 3-hour intervals for about 15 days, has been developed by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) for the Navy Bureau of Ships. Named the Grasshopper, the device can be parachuted from aircraft onto inaccessible territory. Developed during World War II, it automatically will set itself up and periodically make and transmit weather observations over a range of 100 miles. It also may be used as a radio marker beacon."

"Design of modern lighting systems for factories, offices, stores, schools, homes, and other indoor areas will be facilitated through the work of a new lighting measurements laboratory at Nela Park, Cleveland, Ohio, headquarters of General Electric's Lamp Department."
"Television signals in the program service area of an ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) station can be doubled in strength by a slight tilting of the transmitting antenna. In determining the effect of tilting the antenna from its normally vertical position, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) used the facilities of RCA-National Broadcasting Company's experimental station KC2XAK which has been in operation near Bridgeport, Conn., since 1949."

"Donald Ivan Bohn, chief electrical engineer of the Aluminum Company of America, has been awarded the 1950 Lamme Medal “for his pioneering development and application of electrical equipment for controlling rectifying systems in the production of aluminum.” Mr. Bohn is the 23rd recipient of the medal."
"MR. PRESIDENT, honored guests, members of the AIEE, ladies and gentlemen"
"I AM DEEPLY honored to have been chosen the recipient of this year's Lamme award. In receiving this medal, I cannot help but feel particularly proud, as well as extremely humble, as my name is added to the illustrious list of past recipients who have gained this honor. I gratefully accept this medal, not only for myself, but also as a symbol of the great contribution made by the electrical engineers of the aluminum industry."
"The largest electric motors and pumps ever built for oil pipe-line pumping service are being installed by the Texas Pipe Line Company, Houston, Tex., for an expansion of the 515-mile, New Mexico to Oklahoma crude oil line. Eight 3,000-horsepower 1,780-rpm induction motors and seven similar 1,250-horsepower units will add 100,000 barrels of oil per day to the pumping capacity of the pipe-line system. These motors use pressure-lubricated bearings, and are fully enclosed for ventilation from a filtered fresh air source to minimize fire hazard. Despite their great horsepower, the motors will be started across-the-line at full voltage, and they are designed for specially low starting current to minimize the disturbance to the power systems."
"The cadmium sulfide erystal is being used in equipment for fast X-ray inspection of homogeneous substances. The equipment used and the theory utilized in the design of the equipment are described in this article."
"TO DATE, several methods have been introduced to compute the output currents of self-saturating magnetic amplifiers. These analyses are based either on a number of restricting assumptions, such as idealized magnetization curves, or are cumbersome to perform, such as a point-by-point integration. The basic method proposed in this article is between these two extremes; it consists of approximating the magnetization curve by a series of straight lines. Over each region of the magnetization curve, represented by one straight line, the reactor behaves like a constant inductance whose magnitude is proportional to the slope of this line. As the reactor magnetization varies from one region into an adjoining region, the equivalent fixed inductance changes abruptly from one value to another."
"THE EXCITATION of a 70 mega-electron volt synchrotron magnet involves single-phase supply of loss energy to a tuned circuit, usually resonant at 60 cycles, wherein approximately 3,000 kva are circulating. This resonant circuit has a XL/R ratio or Q of approximately 100, thus the frequency sensitivity of the circuit is quite great, and it usually is considered necessary that the input frequency be held within ±0.3 cycle of the magnet circuit resonant frequency."
"MOST FAULTS in transmission and distribution systems are transient or sustained single line-to-ground faults. Resonant neutral grounding is effected by grounding a neutral of the power system through a reactor, the inductive reactance of which matches within broad margins the capacitive reactance-to-ground of the system. Such an iron core reactor is called a ground-fault neutralizer or Petersen coil. After installation of resonant grounding, ground faults do not affect the operation of the consumers' equipment, voltage dips do not occur, and the severity of inductive co-ordination problems is reduced."
"Dynamic strain measurements are becoming increasingly important as the gap between safety and economy grows smaller in modern engineering design. The electrical methods described here are used for strain measurement under actual operating conditions."
"Using crystal-controlled frequency-shift techniques, this system provides fast operation with a high degree of reliablity. This discussion describes the design requirements and tells how they were met."
"ELECTROSTATIC PRECIPITATION derives fundamentally from the mechanical or Coulomb force which is exerted on an electrically charged particle in an electric field. Although other forces of electrical origin may act on particles, these are insignificant compared to the Coulomb force and are of minor importance in electrostatic precipitation. In contrast to electrons and atomic nuclei for which electric charge is a fundamental property, the smoke, fume, fog, and dust particles of technology may be uncharged entirely or charged only to a low degree."
"HETERODYNE oscillators are used frequently in a measuring system in which the oscillator is swept over its frequency range by means of a motor while the characteristic being measured is recorded on a strip of perforated chart paper linked to the frequency control through a toothed chart drive mechanism. The linkage may be purely mechanical or it may be obtained by the use of two synchronous motors, one driving the frequency control of the oscillator and the other the chart advance mechanism on the recorder. One of the advantages of the latter arrangement is that the recording may take place far from the oscillator—say, at the end of a long cable whose transmission is being measured—provided the motors are driven from a power source of accurate frequency."
"DISTRIBUTION engineers, seeking means to provide a better balance of neutral voltage on 3-phase feeders, have suggested the use of grounding banks at one or more points along the feeder. The term 'grounding bank' is used here to mean a Y-delta transformer bank, the Y side tapped from the feeder with the Y neutral connected to the system neutral, whether the latter be an ungrounded conductor, a multigrounded conductor, or simply the earth itself (Figure 1). Such a bank may be installed solely for the performance of grounding duty. The dual role of grounding duty and load service should be considered, particularly for existing load-serving banks."
"Evidence is presented that the duration of voltage dips, as well as their frequency, is an important factor in flicker visibility. The tests include both incandescent and fluorescent lamps."
"OCCASIONALLY it is desirable and even necessary to have available sources of voltage supply of harmonic frequencies. Rotating machines with the appropriate number of poles have been used for this purpose. When the power requirements are low, electronic devices may be used. This article presents results of an analysis of a nonlinear static element circuit which also may be useful as an efficient source of voltage supply of harmonic frequency of good waveform. The circuit is unique in that it uses neither rotating parts nor electronic devices."
"BECAUSE OF a mild climate (3,613 degree days per year) and a very low residential power rate, electrical house heating has become so popular in the territory served by the Nashville Electric Service that at the close of 1950 over 11,000 homes were heated electrically. This represents a saturation of nearly 15 per cent. Practically all of these have been connected since 1945."
"Low terminal costs and single cable operation make this the first economically practical carrier system for medium-haul telephone circuits. Performance is not sacrificed for economy."

"The GL-5855, a new inert-gas-filled thyratron, has massive anode and grid elements sealed directly to a heavy-walled glass envelope. These elements, therefore, are cooled by convection as well as by radiation, permitting full-load operation with low grid current."
"ELECTRIC RAILROADS have made no per cent gain in total traffic during the past ten years. Trucks, Diesel locomotives, pipe lines, and canal systems are gaining in per cent of traffic. The electrical manufacturers are selling Diesel locomotives, and indirectly oil, rather than electric locomotives which use power generated by coal or water. Operating and maintenance costs are about 44 per cent greater for Diesel than electric locomotives, and the advantage of electricity increases as the price of oil increases."
"ONE OF THE basic criteria of the performance of any communication or signalling circuit is its signal-to-noise ratio. It is possible to estimate the signal that will be delivered to a receiving point by a power-line carrier transmitter, but the noise level also must be known for the signal-to-noise ratio to be predicted."
"THE LOAD capability and performance of high-voltage transmission lines can be improved by the installation of series capacitors. Some reasons for the application of series capacitors to transmission circuits are: 1. To effect the desired load division between parallel circuits. 2. To increase the load capacity of a transmission line by a nominal amount (0 to 50 per cent). 3. To provide increased line capacity so that the system can handle short-time emergency loads. 4. To increase the transient stability limits of a system. 5. To improve voltage regulation and power factor for a given load condition by reducing the operating angle of the line."

"Significant advances in the development of the transistor,1 the tiny amplifying crystal, have led to the construction of the “junction transistor,”2−4 a new device with properties never before achieved in any amplifier. Like the original transistor, it is based on the semiconducting properties of germanium, and requires no vacuum, no glass envelope, and no heating element to cause warmup delay. It consists of a tiny rod-shaped germanium crystal treated so that it embodies a thin electrically positive layer sandwiched between two electrically negative ends."

"The establishment of a new National Bureau of Standards (NBS) laboratory center at Corona, Calif., to be devoted to various phases of electronic research, developmsnt, and engineering was announced recently. To be known as the Corona Laboratories, National Bureau of Standards, the new research center will be concerned primarily with technical problems of importance to the Department of Defense. The site was transferred to NBS by the Department of the Navy because of the Bureau's urgent need for new facilities. About 22 buildings are being renovated to accommodate NBS research and development activities being transferred there from Washington. Dr. R. D. Huntoon, formerly Chief of the NBS Atomic and Radiation Physics Division, has been named associate director to head the new laboratories, which are expected to be in essentially full-scale operation by this month."
"TO OBTAIN d-c plate-supply voltages for electronic equipment operated from storage batteries, it is customary to use either dynamotors or vibrators. Both devices have been used successfully for automobile radio receivers, for example, but engineers have been fascinated for a long time by the possibility of transforming low d-c voltages to higher voltages without mechanical motion."

"THE CALCULATION of fault currents in short-circuited rectifiers is given in an AIEE committee report,1 but it does not give any information on faults which fall in the region between high overloads and short circuit, nor for calculation of fault currents resulting from short circuits at distant points of extensive d-c systems."
"RECENT EXPANSION in generating capacity of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, together with the policy of centralized control, has necessitated a power-line carrier channel mileage of approximately 16,000 operating over 2,600 circuit miles of the power network. Complexities in operating conditions and requirements, and a limited frequency spectrum, 50–200 kc, require quantitative measurements and consideration of the more important transmission factors in the co-ordination of a power-line carrier network."
"Today many different types of components are available in hermetically sealed units. These, though initially expensive, may prove worthy, because components last longer, maintenance is easier, and the parts are relatively tamperproof."
"These two 40-ton electric side-arm pusher locomotives were placed in service recently on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. These units operate on a special narrow-gauge track between standard railroad tracks. Power is supplied to each unit's two electric motors by a 250-volt third rail. Pincer-shaped arms, which spring out on both sides of the locomotive and hook onto the freight cars, enable the units to move two lines of freight cars simultaneously when necessary. By moving cars swiftly to the unloading area and back again, these side-pushers eliminate the tremendous amount of shuttling required with standard switchers. This installation makes possible the unloading of a 30,000-ton ore boat in 24 hours. The locomotives were built by the General Electric Company."
"THE LATEST AIEE Committee Report on Grounding Practices1 indicated a trend toward increased use of Petersen coils in high-voltage power systems in this country. A study was undertaken to analyze the application of resonant grounding and questionnaires were sent to all operators using Petersen coils."
"THE TRANSIENT RESPONSE of magnetic amplifiers with cores of gradually varying incremental permeability can be analyzed with methods already applied in previous articles. For this, the alternating component of core fluxes is assumed to vary sinusoidally and the normal magnetization curve is approximated by a hyperbolic sine function of the type H = U sinh uB. A straightforward integration of the differential equations of the control circuits for a step change of the signal voltage becomes hereby possible, at least for “slow” transients lasting over a few cycles of the a-c source frequency, and curves representing the output current (rms or rectified average) during the transient can be calculated."
"Spanning the continent from coast to coast, this microwave relay system provides six channels, each of which can carry one television circuit or hundreds of telephone circuits. Some features of this vast network are described."
"Combining desirable features of several instruments, this recording tachometer can measure speed variations in rotating shafts produced by gear, belt, chain, and other types of drives, and also determine resonant frequencies of rotating systems and measure torque pulsations."
"A forward step in the industrialization of the Philippine Islands was taken recendy when the first mechanical rectifier manufactured especially for them was demonstrated at the plant of the I-T-E Circuit Breaker Company. When it is put into operation outside Manila, the capital of the Philippines, it will make the Islands independent of outside chlorine services."
"A Section growth plan was developed and adopted in District 2 for the years ending August 1, 1949, and August 1, 1950. The purpose of this plan was to encourage Sections by recognizing and rewarding outstanding effort. The plan seemed to have enough merit for Past-President LeClair to appoint a special committee to study a Section growth plan. This committee was to determine if this or a similar plan should be adopted on a national scale. Following is a report of this committee giving a formula for application of such a plan on a national basis and rules for application of this plan. This plan was approved by the Board of Directors on January 25, 1951."

"THE RECENT INSTALLATION by the British Columbia Electric Company of a 3-phase delta-connected submarine power cable circuit, in which two of the conductors are single-core cables and the third conductor is the ground path, appears to be an innovation in submarine cable practice. The circuit is laid in the Pacific Ocean from the British Columbia mainland to an island about three miles off shore. The depth of the sea water in the channel is about 800 feet. When the project first was conceived, it was taken more or less for granted that armored 3-conductor cable would be installed, since this type of cable previously had been the conventional choice for submarine power cable work. However, upon detailed analysis it was found that single-conductor cable would have outstanding advantages. These advantages were evident in all three main aspects of the project; namely, the dollar economy of the complete installation, the physical handling of the cable, and the electrical operation of the circuit. The studies made lead to the conclusion that in many submarine installations, the traditional use of 3-conductor cable might well be abandoned in favor of single-conductor cable."
"While hydroelectric power generation is only one aspect of the development of a river valley, it is an essential one. General O. E. Walsh of the Corps of Engineers describes the Columbia River Basin development and the part that water power plays in this great project."
"THERE ARE many uses of metallic rectifiers in telephone power plants where rectifiers are required. These applications vary from 2 to 2,500 volts and in power sizes of a few watts to 10 kw. The metallic rectifiers are used primarily for charging storage batteries. However, there are many applications where the d-c power is used directly to supply relay circuits, talking battery, plate and filament for vacuum-tube amplifiers, telegraph circuits, and teletypewriters."

"THE CALCULATION of temperature transients in cable systems under a stated condition of loading which may be either variable or constant is a complicated procedure involving the application of a high order of mathematics."
"The study of the effects of electric shock on living animals has been pursued for over 200 years. The author reviews the literature which has been written on the subject, discusses animal experimentation and actual field cases, and draws definite conclusions."
"A further development in the author's method for finding the effects of interconnection on the service reliability of interconnected systems and for determining the optimum capacity of the interconnection is presented."
"ANALYTICAL solutions to nonlinear transients such as the phenomena of inrush currents in transformers are notoriously difficult to obtain unless a simple, convenient relationship exists between the dependent variables. Generally the transient may be determined by a graphical or step-by-step process. This procedure is lengthy and tedious and results only in a particular numerical solution which does not yield insight into the influence of changes of design or operating conditions. In light of these difficulties, it is desirable in this problem to make assumptions and approximations which will produce a simple convenient relationship between the variables, resulting in an analytical expression for the first crest and successive crests of the inrush magnetizing current."
"To meet the exacting requirements of the new transcontinental microwave relay system, specially designed frequency-modulation terminal equipment was constructed. The terminal transmitter converts either message or television signals to a frequency-modulated signal centered on 70 megacycles and the terminal frequency-modulation receiver recovers these signals, thus providing a link between the relay system and other telephone facilities."
"In the first installation of its kind, a General Electric beta-ray gauge is being used at the Antioch, Calif., plant of the Fibreboard Products Corporation to help maintain accurate and uniform weight of milk-carton paperboard. The gauge, mounted on one of the company's 136-inch paperboard machines, records the varying amounts of beta rays absorbed by the board as it passes through the gauge head of the noncontacting device. The amount of beta rays absorbed varies with the weight of the board, thus allowing a constant check to be maintained. Variations as slight as one per cent from the desired weight per unit area of the board are indicated and recorded automatically. Operators are able to make adjustments of the processing machinery as needed to produce paperboard of uniform weight. This is particularly important in the case of milk-carton board and similar material that is run through folding machines which operate on extremely close tolerances. The gauge, which is not affected by the speed, consistency, or temperature of the material being measured, also may be applied to other materials. Since no part of the gauge is in actual contact with the material being measured, it leaves no mark or scratch."
"CIRCUIT-BREAKER BUSHINGS, or load-ratio control-transformer-contactor bushings, may operate with one end immersed in oil containing various concentrations of small carbon particles. Such particles may be attracted to the bushing insulator surface. The behaviour of carbon particles in oil was investigated for the purpose of finding means of minimizing or avoiding the accumulation of carbon particles on the bushing insulator surface."
"MOST OF THE INFORMATION in the literature on line insulator losses is concerned with conditions leading to flashover. Much less information is available on the loss characteristics of insulators under normal conditions, and that available is somewhat contradictory. A summary of published information is presented in Figure 1. Information on insulator loss under normal conditions is of considerable interest to corona loss investigators because it is desirable to be able to differentiate between corona and insulator loss. Utility engineers frequently are concerned about normal insulator loss when attempting to evaluate system losses."
"TWELVE high-speed 230-kv oil circuit breakers rated 10,000,000 kva interrupting capacity are installed now in transmission-line and bus-tie positions of the left switchyard at the Grand Coulee Power Plant. The development of these important pieces of protective equipment has required extensive short-circuit testing both in a manufacturer's high-power laboratory and at Grand Coulee Dam. This article covers the final stages of that development and describes in particular the field tests which were made in August 1950 in order to verify the circuit-breaker interrupting capacity rating of 10,000,000 kva and also to determine any possible margin above this figure."
"Progress in water wheel generator design is marked by improved reliability, greater compactness, and easier maintenance. Both umbrella-type and enclosed generators are still widely used, while underground and outdoor stations are becoming increasingly popular. Some design and construction problems of these generators are discussed."
"Essentially a d-c to a-c converter, this induction galvanometer is admirably suited for making sensitive d-c measurements. Its operating frequency may be in the megacycle region if desired, the conversion energy gain is high, and ample signal is obtained for a-c amplification."
"Radial arms of the upper bearing and thrustbearing support for an 82,500-kva 100-per cent power factor 180-rpm suspended-type vertical synchronous generator for Hoover Dam are being machined on a 40-foot boring mill in the shop of the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company, Milwaukee, Wis. The generator is one of two to be driven by 115,000-horsepower 480-foot head hydraulic turbines. When installed these will be the largest complete hydroelectric units ever built by one company. The two turbines will be duplicates of seven previous units built by Allis-Chalmers for this same installation, except that the spiral casing sections are of welded plate steel construction instead of cast steel as was used in the original units."
"THE ADOPTION of forced-oil forced-air cooling for large power transformers by the electrical industry has created a new problem for the operator of the equipment. The experience of this large utility has been that the supplier has not furnished a self-cooled rating for his product. Thus, the problem of determining this self-cooled rating has fallen upon the purchaser and operator of the equipment."
"Noise and instability in television pictures resulting from power-line synchronization are becoming a greater problem as networks expand. Some of the inherent difficulties and their causes are discussed in this article."
"Lack of a common language makes communication between engineers in allied fields difficult. A unified symbolism and terminology for feedback control is suggested here."
"Compact machine designs require that minimum safe leakage distances on insulating surfaces be known. A number of factors which affect this distance in d-c systems have been studied and are the subject of this article."
"A full week of stimulating technical sessions, interest-packed inspection trips, and relaxing entertainment awaits the AIEE membership at the Fall General Meeting in Cleveland, October 22–26. Both the technical program and the inspection trips were planned with the wide interests of the membership in mind."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"The Pacific General Meeting, held in Portland, Oreg., August 20-23, 1951, with headquarters in the Multnomah Hotel, was a well-arranged program of 21 sessions including an opening session and Student technical session. Inspection trips were scheduled to nearby power projects and industries. In the evenings social features were arranged and there were special events for the ladies. An all-time record attendance for Pacific General Meetings of 887 members and guests was established. Friday an all-day trip was taken to Oregon State College at Corvallis, and on the return the Northwest Electrodevelopment Laboratory of the United States Bureau of Mines was visited, as well as the M and M Woodworking Company where the manufacture of plywood was seen from the log to the finished product."
"A regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Institute was held in the Royal York Hotel, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on June 28, 1951."
"The board of examiners, at its recent meeting recommended the members listed for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objection to these transfers should be filed at once with the national secretary."
"A new harbor radar system which will guide vessels in fog has been built for the port of Le Havre, France, and was demonstrated recently in the harbor at Boston, Mass. The equipment was designed and constructed specifically for this purpose by the Raytheon Manufacturing Company, Waltham, Mass."
"The first telephone call Coast-to-coast along the new microwave radio-relay skyway of the Long lines Department of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company was made on August 17, 1951. Supplying a new backbone telephone route, vital to civilian and military needs of the nation, the project is the longest microwave system in the world. The new facilities for the first time will send telephone conversations across the continent by radio rather than wire or cable."

"The purpose of the Convocation was to inform the engineering profession of the country about the critical shortage of engineers and the program of the Engineering Manpower Commission and to invoke widespread co-operation in carrying it out."
"THE AMERICAN PEOPLE recognize that their country has a tremendous capacity to produce goods of all kinds. They have seen this country turn out prodigious quantities as materiel for support of its Army, Navy, and Air Force and for the support of its allies in defending the world against the destruction of democracy. The people have great faith in the country's power to produce. This power hinges upon the scientific and technical know-how through which the abilities to design, research, produce, and properly operate the vast wheels of industry, come about. The country witnessed a great development of its scientists and engineers during World War II. It came to realize that great dependence was placed upon the achievements of these men in the final winning of the war."
"IT SHOULD BE CLEAR from what has already been said today that the major problems confronting the nation are in the field of manpower or are closely related to manpower. It is also true that in the manpower field the problem is most acute and has its greatest impact for the age groups coinciding with the age of college attendance. This makes the present manpower crisis extraordinarily important for the future because the actions which are taken to solve these problems will have their major effects not so much now as in the future–5 and 10 and 20 or more years from now. It is not too much to state that an unwise resolution of these problems could fundamentally alter the nature of our civilization and dissipate its essential strength to the point where it will be extremely vulnerable in any future conflict."
"BEYOND THE NECESSITY for technological preparedness in the military sense, the engineering profession is faced with the challenge of increasing the productivity of industry and improving the material standard of living. Either in itself constitutes a ringing challenge, but when the two are superimposed the necessity for aggressive attack upon the problem becomes even greater. In this period of our history it is not merely essential that technology develop and produce the weapons and equipment essential to the maintenance of military superiority, but that, at the same time, it carry out its major share in the development and production of articles of such attractiveness, usefulness, and serviceability to the civilian economy that the cost of military preparedness can be borne. The wreck of our civil economy would be as disastrous as military defeat. Maintenance of strength in our civil structure as well as in our military establishment is essential. In both, the role of the engineer is a dominant one, supply of engineering manpower is a critical problem, the failure to make full utilization of available engineering skills is a wasteful procedure which must be eliminated."
"CORROSION OF VITAL PARTS of electric equipment presents a serious problem in many industries which manufacture or use chemicals, or in which corrosive gases, dusts, or liquids are a by-product of the process operations. It is also present in plants located near salt water, in mines, and even in steam-generating plants which use hogged fuel or coal. Corrosion of electric apparatus not only causes high maintenance and operating costs but presents a definite safety hazard."
"Recording experimental data from a number of widely dispersed test stations is achieved efficiently in this laboratory by centralizing the recording equipment in a single location. The recording center contains all recording, intermediate, and control equipment which can be combined into any desired system by means of patch cords."
"THE DIELECTRIC-LOSS and power-factor method of testing insulation has been in use by many operating companies for almost 20 years for determining when new equipment meets minimum requirements for insulation and to keep equipment in use in good operating condition through adequate maintenance. The equipment for making dielectric-loss and power-factor tests consists of means for supplying a-c potential to insulation and meters, from the readings of which the power factor of the current through the insulation may be determined. This test will detect moisture, dirt, carbon deposits, carbonization of wood and other organic material, corrosion of bushing leads due to corona, and almost all insulation defects. The test is not a destructive test since voltages below operating voltage generally are used. The test sets are sufficiently rugged for field use and can be transported easily. Highly technical personnel are not required to make tests and analyze the results, but test engineers must have common sense, intelligence, and thorough knowledge of the apparatus being tested."
"The heat-dissipating characteristics, as well as electronic characteristics, determine the successful operation of an electron tube. The tube designer, by means of thermal circuits, can evaluate thermal resistances, determine operating temperatures, and find the heat losses, so that he can provide for adequate ventilation."
"ALLOWABLE AND actual loadings of transformers of the Commonwealth Edison Company have increased considerably in the past 15 years with consequent rises in transformer temperatures. Oils with improved oxidation stability have gained increased importance, especially for older type transformers in service. An immediate interest developed in inhibited oil when it became commercially available in 1946, and a program of tests was initiated at that time to determine the extent of its superiority."
"MODERN CONTROL ROOMS in utility and industrial power stations are nerve centers of multimillion-dollar operations. Lighting for these important work areas can be provided in various ways depending upon what limits are assigned the task. If one considers the medium of lighting as a small but important part of the power plant entity and it is recognized that over-all economy is the result of economical parts, then the search for an adequate lighting scheme narrows considerably."
"Many types of industrial plants can generate their own electricity economically under certain conditions. Such conditions, and various methods for making the most of them, are set forth in this article."
"ONE OF THE most important applications of scries capacitors in long-distance transmission is to increase power capability to the economic maximum. This involves an increase in transient as well as steady-state stability of the transmission facility."
"A METHOD OF ANALYSIS is outlined to solve steady-state problems arising in the operation of large interconnected transmission systems exchanging power between their own operating divisions and outside companies. Special attention is paid to the calculation of total and incremental losses between the various subsidiary and outside companies. This first part restricts itself to laying the necessary foundations for the numerical study made in a companion paper1 on the system of the American Gas and Electric Company, New York, N. Y."
"To meet the stringent requirements of the 4,000-mile transcontinental microwave relay system, a number of new developments had to be included in the design of the repeater stations. The circuits of these unattended stations, and how they are maintained, are the subject of this article."
"Promising appreciable savings in maintenance costs, this equipment has some features new to a-c rapid-transit car design. A truck-mounted motor drives each axle and a cam-operated controller operates the resistance acceleration."
"WHEN SINGLE-PHASE voltage regulators are connected in delta or in open-delta on 3-phase systems, the regulator is excited by the line-to-line voltage, but it transmits line current. For this reason, a line-drop compensator in the control circuit of a regulator so connected has a 30-degree phase difference between its voltage and current supplies. The proper operation of the regulator depends upon the line-drop compensator's duplicating, in the control circuit, the effect of resistance and reactance voltage drops in the line. To permit this, the effect of the 30-degree phase displacement between voltage and current must be counterbalanced."
"WIDESPREAD INTEREST in 2,6 ditertiary butyl para cresol (DBPC) as an inhibitor for transformer oils has resulted in extensive usage, largely based on evaluation by laboratory means. Earlier studies reported in a paper by the authors1 on long operation of small semi-sealed transformers indicated that evaluation in actual transformers was desirable and also that useful information might be obtained from accelerated operation."
"Block diagram networks consisting of linear unidirectional elements form the basis for this simple and direct method of transforming and reducing networks for analysis. Particularly applicable to servomechanisms and control circuits, this method is similar in approach to Y-delta transformation and series-parallel reduction for solving ordinary networks."
"PERMANENT-MAGNET alternators have been used for many years in small-sized units such as tachometer generators, governor frequency sources, and magnetos, but until recently have not been adopted widely as primary sources of power. With the development of dispersion-hardening alloys typified by the Alnico family and their application to rotating machinery, the permanent-magnet alternator has assumed a more important role for power applications. In some ratings these machines weigh less, consume less space, and cost less than d-c excited alternators. The saving in weight and space is accomplished chiefly by the elimination of the d-c exciter. When the exciter is absent, commutation problems are eliminated. Hence, these machines are assuming an important role for portable, aircraft, and other applications in which the saving of weight is an essential factor."
"IN ORDER to field classify used insulating oils into “those suitable for continued service” and “those in doubtful condition,” the American Gas and Electric System about 10 years ago developed and put into use a test kit, as shown in Figure 1, for measuring neutralization value and color of oils. These test kits were put into the hands of the field insulation test crews which already had facilities for measuring oil power factor, with the request that oil from each piece of equipment be tested for neutralization number, color, and power factor and examined for visual presence of sludge."
"A unique magnetic pickup device makes the magnetic tape recorder adaptable to the recording of power system transient phenomena. Besides eliminating the inconvenience and expense of conventional photographic methods, this technique produces a permanent record starting well in advance of the transient being recorded."
"THE MEMORY OF several electronic computers is based on the storage of charges on discrete areas of the inner faces of cathode-ray tubes. The location of these charges is determined by a resistor network, called a deflection generator."
"IN RECENT YEARS there has been an increasing demand for air-break switches capable of interrupting load currents, charging currents, and moderate fault currents on highest voltage systems. In answer to this demand an experimental 115-kv interrupter switch was subjected to field tests and designs for 46, 69, and 115 kv were developed and are now in service on many high-voltage systems."
"THE NECESSITY FOR long-distance transmission of electric power has grown rapidly during recent years. Line reactance becomes a problem of increasing importance when transmission distances continue to increase. Long lines cannot be loaded sufficiently for maximum over-all economy because of limitations imposed by transient stability and kilovar requirements."
"The need for a sensitive, quick-acting, and reliable compass for small aircraft led to the development of this induction compass which utilizes the stroboscopic effect."
"Besides providing a high-grade 2-way telephone circuit, this carrier current system used by the Georgia Power Company transmits control signals for operating voltage regulator and capacitor switches, alarm signals when oil circuit breakers trip or tap-changing-under-load transformers get out of step, and telemetered voltage signals."
"In electrostatic precipitation of high-resistivity dust, the voltage drop across the collected layer of dust on the large electrodes may be high enough to cause electrical breakdown. This and other troubles usually can be eliminated by operating at a higher relative humidity or by liberal use of adhesives."
"A new method of cooling large turbine generators makes it possible to increase ratings by one-half. The technique consists of blowing hydrogen gas at high velocity through specially constructed hollow generator coils."
"Sixty-eight technical sessions and conferences are already planned for the 1952 Winter General Meeting to be held January 21–25 at the Hotel Statler, New York City, N. Y. As the 1951 meeting exceeded in size and attendance the meeting which was held in 1950 so this year's meeting is expected to exceed the previous figures by a substantial margin. It is fully expected that the maximum number of technical sessions which can be scheduled will be reached before the final program is announced."

Y., on September 13. Communications was the theme of the meeting and the various speakers emphasized the importance of a reliable network in the event of a disaster, whether caused by an atom bomb or by natural phenomena."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"The installation of the first supercharged generator at the Edgewater plant of the Wisconsin Power and Light Company in Sheboygan, Wis., has been announced by the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company, Milwaukee, Wis. This new design 60,000-kw 12,500-volt 3,600-rpm steam turbine driven generator was installed in midsummer and is now in operation. It embodies a new principle which saves 30 to 40 per cent of the material of a normal 60,000-kw machine."

"The atomic energy industry, and the important part played in that industry by the electrical engineer, are described by T. K. Glennan, AEC Commissioner. The Commission's attempts to find useful peacetime applications are presented. The necessity for a continuing and increasing supply of engineers for the prosecution of the atomic energy program is stressed."
"Crane controls so sensitive they can regulate the movement of a 250-ton load to within 1/32 inch were tested recently at McNary Dam by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. McNary Dam is located on the Columbia River near Umatilla. Oreg. Developed by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, the new adjustable-voltage control has been installed on the first of two 200-ton gantrycranes built by the Judson Pacific-Murphy Corporation, Emeryville, Calif. These cranes will be used to raise and lower the 126-ton spillway gates at the dam as shown in the picture. When a gate is raised, the load on the crane approaches twice the weight of the gate, because of the downward pressure of the water rushing under it. Each crane is 60 feet long, 42 feet wide, and towers 77 feet above the top of the dam. Mounted on 16 wheels, the giant cranes move along the top of the dam on rails placed 34 feet apart."
"THE PROPER FUNCTIONING of electric contacts is of great practical importance. Much work has been done on contacts, but comparatively little has been done on types of transient phenomena occurring in inductive d-c circuits when the circuit is broken. This oscilloscopic investigation covered the variation of transients occurring for a fixed contact pair over a range of lumped inductance and lumped capacitance values in a contact circuit. In addition, effects on the transients of varying the current and the voltage impressed on the circuit were studied."
"The two most important aspects of fire protection in electric generating stations—prevention by engineering design and fire fighting—are discussed in detail."
"SOME PAST PRACTICES in the high-voltage transmission of power have been more conservative than proved necessary. Liberalized practices put into effect on the 230-kv system of the Bonneville Power Administration have resulted in sizable annual savings."
"Statistical engineering has many applications useful to the utility engineer who must process large amounts of data. How some problems were solved by one large utility using these techniques, and some possible future applications, are presented here."
"Presented from the viewpoint of the circuit designer, this article discusses the factors which enter into the development of an operating circuit with the desired performance. Emphasis is on the vertical deflection blocking oscillator, but the principles also apply to the horizontal oscillator."
"FOR YEARS sawmills have used various forms of specialized machinery to produce reciprocating and oscillating motions for log and timber-handling operations. Until recently this machinery was powered by steam (air) cylinder and piston, simple devices well suited to the applications, being fast, powerful, of low cost, and of rugged construction, an essential service requirement. Sawmill waste was used to generate the mill's total steam and power requirements."
"Public address, or loudspeaker, systems can perform many useful functions in a generating plant which are not as readily performed by other types of communication systems. Here are presented those factors of this particular application of public address systems which must be considered in designing the system."
"I COME BEFORE YOU as one whose professional career was profoundly influenced by Dugald C. Jackson, and I venture to represent all those whose lives have thus been influenced, many of whom are here with me. It is well that we should meet and remember as we do, not only because of our respect and affection for our old chief, but also because many of the things for which he stood strongly are still of great moment in the professional world and worthy of continued emphasis."
"Exhaustive studies of the occurrence of thunderstorms and the effects of lightning on power lines have been carried on by the Japanese Society for the Advancement of Science. This article is a brief report to illustrate the present status of these studies."
"THE PURPOSE OF this study was to determine the most economical terminal voltages to use on a 230-kv transmission line. To do this, annual transmission costs per unit of transmitted load were calculated and plotted as a function of receiver voltage. This was done for several sender voltages, receiver loads, line lengths, and so forth. The minimum points of the cost curves gave the most economical receiver voltage for the assumed conditions. The receiver-to-sender voltage ratio (only voltage magnitude is significant in this ratio) was determined for the minimum cost points. A plot then was made of terminal voltage ratio ER/ES versus receiver load for maximum economy; see Figure 1."
"IMPROPER PERFORMANCE of gun-type oil burners operating with from 5 to 15 gallons of oil per hour led to an investigation that pointed to ignition delay as the cause of malfunctioning. The delay referred to is the time interval occurring between application of voltage to the ignition transformer primary and the initiation of the spark discharge in the spark gap."
"The wide variety of hazards to which Bell System cable sheaths are subjected imposes many design problems. This article describes the nature of these hazards and their effect on cable sheath engineering."
"ALTHOUGH GAS-TUBE INVERTERS have had only moderate use in the past, they have potentialities of far wider applications in many fields. Possible applications include use of inverters to supply power to induction and synchronous motors, use of inverters at the receiving end of a d-c transmission line, and use of inverters in electric railway systems to allow power to flow from the d-c system to the a-c supply. Certain polyphase circuits have been designed primarily for operation at a fixed-frequency or over a limited-frequency range. If operation of polyphase inverters can be extended down to zero frequency, inverters may be able to supply variable-frequency power to polyphase induction and synchronous motors, thereby providing continuously variable speed from zero to full speed in either direction. An inverter circuit capable of this type of operation is the 3-phase bridge-type inverter which is commutated by capacitors connected across the output terminals of the inverter, as shown in Figure 1."
"WHEN CURRENT TRANSFORMERS are applied in the vicinity of busses carrying large currents, the transformer accuracy may be very seriously affected. This is particularly true on systems which normally carry over 2,000 amperes and may carry 10 or 20 times this current during faults. A current transformer designed to operate protective relays during such a fault may be rendered completely useless by improper installation. For instance, Figure 1 gives the accuracy of a certain current transformer with the primary return conductor at several different spacings."
"Vibration of conductors is an important factor in transmission line design. Just how important is the subject of this article, which describes the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's efforts to mitigate the effects of vibration by lessening line tension and improving design of clamps and splices, and actual operating experience with vibration in the Department's line from Boulder Dam."
"ANALOGUE COMPUTERS usually are considered to perform combinations of seven basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, differentiation, integration, and function generation. This article considers applications of a comparison operation which consists of a comparison of two quantities followed by one or more of the seven basic operations."
"By designing the basic exciter circuit of an alternator to make the machine as self-regulating as possible, and using the remaining deviations of output voltage to provide a correction signal to the exciter, the steady-state alternator voltage can easily be kept within ±0.6 per cent. No antihunt means are needed, transient response is rapid, and a short circuit will not cause loss of excitation."
"A new attack on the relay design problem has led to improved long-term dependability, maintenance-free life, and reduction in size and cost. A novel armature and contact mounting design provides better transmission performance than that of any other relay now in large-scale use."
"THE TRACY PUMPING PLANT, now being completed, is located on the Delta-Mendota Canal near Tracy, Calif. It is one of a series of works to provide an adequate supply of water to the lower San Joaquin Valley from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. At one time a considerable acreage in this area was placed under cultivation by irrigation. Much of this irrigation was from wells which in time lowered the water table, depleted supplies, and in some cases necessitated abandonment of cultivation. Diversion of water by the Friant Dam to the upper San Joaquin has further reduced supplies available to the lower valley."
"This pulse amplitude-modulated system was developed to fulfill the need for a short-haul low-cost communications link having a moderate traffic capacity. For this short-range operation, the microwave equipment has been simplified by eliminating many of the refinements necessary for trunk-line operation."
"The sensitivity of reversible switches can be adjusted to varying degrees by using a suitable linear feedback coefficient. Maximum sensitivity depends on the characteristic curve of the switch, and methods are presented for determining this maximum and the feedback coefficient needed to achieve it."
"This schematic diagram shows the operation of the remotely controlled microscope made by the American Optical Company's Instrument Division for the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory which is operated at Schenectady, N. Y., by the General Electric Company for the Atomic Energy Commission. With the aid of this microscope scientists may safely examine highly radioactive metal specimens located inside a test chamber with 3-foot concrete walls. Two periscopes are provided: one to carry in light to the specimen; the other to bring out its magnified image, so it may be examined visually or photographed. The offsets in the periscopes trap harmful radiations."
"THE PROXIMITY OF humming electric equipment to dwellings is becoming a concern to the utility engineers. The main cause of this noise is the minute pulsation of the laminations submitted to a 60-cycle-per-second alternating flux. This phenomenon is called the magnetostriction and its intensity depends on the induction present in the steel."
"The number of technical sessions and conferences for the Winter General Meeting has been increased from 68, as announced in the November issue of Electrical Engineering, to 73. Among those sessions which have been added are: Industrial Control, Space Heating, Management, Electrical Applications in Pipe Line Transportation, Electric Heating, Industrial Power Systems, Electronics in Industry, and Feedback Control Systems."

"How nice 'twould be if we could send To every engineering friend A special verse or New Year's card, But you're so many it's too hard."
"NOTEWORTHY ADVANCES were made in the electrical engineering field during 1950; they may be divided into five broad categories: communications, power, science and electronics, industry, and general applications. The highlights in communications were the Federal Communications Commission's decision to authorize the field sequential color television system as standard, extension of television broadcasting, and further growth of microwave networks. The power field saw plans made for the construction of a 300/315-kv line which will be the highest voltage line in the United States. More and more centralized control rooms are being used, and this year saw the installation of the first completely centralized control board for a large steam-generating station. The continued improvement and reliability of electronic components has helped to increase the use of electronic computers in business, research, design, statistics, and military fields. Several new types of radiation detectors, some quite inexpensive, have been put on the market. In industry, electric welding has shown many gains; automatic equipment is being used, and speed and flexibility have been attained. Electrical controllers for many industries have been developed. General applications of electrical engineering have been many. In land transportation the trend from steam to Diesel locomotives has continued unabated, and lightweight traction motors and associated equipment have been put into use. The number of heat pumps in operation has increased to about 750. Some of the 1950 engineering developments are reviewed here by the AIEE technical committees."
"Industry and engineering are dependent on one another. What the young engineer can give to industry and get from it is discussed by Past President Lee."
"The development of microwave radio has presented the power industry with a valuable tool for transmitting many types of intelligence. It is now being applied to the communication system of the Bonneville Power Administration, since the use of power line carrier by it and ten major interconnected power utilities has almost saturated the available carrier spectrum."
"IN ORDER to solve the problem of a 3-phase short circuit on the terminals of a saturated machine, one generally starts by writing the differential equation for each winding either on the stator or on the rotor. Any of these differential equations is of the form e=pψ—ir. The solution of these equations under the specified initial conditions gives the solution to the problem. However, the difficulty in their solution arises from their nonlinearity. Here there are two kinds of nonlinearity. The first is due to the change of the coupling coefficients between the different windings due to the rotation of the rotor. This nonlinearity could be removed by using the transform to direct and quadrature components as used by R. H. Park.1 The second kind of nonlinearity is due to the saturation in the magnetic circuit, and it could be dealt with by separating the solution into a free transient that meets linear conditions and a particular solution that meets saturated conditions and could be obtained using Reinhold Rüdenberg's method by analysis2 with the initial current being obtained by the principle of conservation of flux linkage.3 The differential equations of the stator winding transformed to direct and quadrature components as given by Mr. Park1 are"
"The backscattering of radiation from radioactive substances now is being used to measure thin coatings. This is a nondestructive process which can be used in production wherever measurement is to be made of a coating which has a different atomic number from the backing material."
"SLIGHT VARIATIONS in the performance of the surface condenser of a steam turbine power plant can make substantial differences in the over-all thermal efficiency of the plant. Since this portion of the plant has been to date the subject of less intensive study as far as supervisory instrumentation is concerned, the surface condenser has been chosen as the typical unit to be studied from the viewpoint of supervising instruments."
"ECONOMICS of modern power distribution demand more than ever before that service on low-voltage systems be continuous and that unfaulted portions of the system receive a minimum of interference as a result of faults elsewhere on the system."
"THE HIGHLY COMPLEX NATURE of the material, the resulting difficulty in establishing significant tests for evaluation in a reasonable time, and the varying conditions of use have combined to make the study of oils used for the insulation and cooling of transformers a painfully slow process. It is the purpose of this article to review some of the very extensive efforts made in this study and to draw at least tentative conclusions as to the present status and future possibilities of one of the most important materials in the design, manufacture, and operation of transformers."
"This is a discussion of one manufacturer's program to provide a test facility for evaluating rotating electric equipment not exceeding 100 pounds in weight and over-all dimensions of 30 by 10 by 15 inches, and having d-c or a-c power dissipation of five kw. The program required two years to complete at an expenditure of more than $160,000."
"COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE digital computing equipment of the punch-card type1,2 permits the expeditious direct application of relatively complex analytical expressions to the evaluation of the conventional thermodynamic properties of pure substances and mixtures. In the case of hydrocarbons, the Benedict equation3,4 is of particular utility in describing the effect of pressure, temperature, and composition upon the thermodynamic properties of a system. However, the complexity of such an expression makes this application time-consuming unless automatic computing equipment is employed. Beattie5 has outlined the general nature of the calculations associated with the evaluation of the thermodynamic properties of homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. These methods apply to pure substances and multicomponent systems alike."
"IN ORDER to determine the stability and transient characteristics of a system in which a carbon-pile regulator controls the voltage of a d-c generator, an analysis of the transfer function of the regulator has been made. The transfer function was defined in such a way that the regulator can conveniently be considered a linear amplifier in a feedback control loop. Also, the definition was chosen so that empirical measurements of the regulator transfer function would be feasible. Input and output variables are taken as changes from the initial operating points of operating coil voltage and carbon-pile resistance, respectively. By definition the transfer function of the regulator is the complex quantity R(ω)/e."
"A negative-impedance telephone repeater has been designed to reduce transmission losses on systems using tandem switching, or for toll connecting trunks and special service lines. The repeater, consisting of a transformer, an amplifier, and a network, has been arranged as a complete unit in itself, to simplify its installation."
"THE NEW LIGHT STEEL tower line designs recently adopted by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) brought estimated savings in excess of 12,500 tons of steel and $4,000,000 during the first two years of practical application. These designs resulted from engineering studies begun during World War II to save critical steel, and continued during postwar years in order to combat the sharp rises which have taken place in transmission-line construction costs."
"THE SINGLE-SIDEBAND suppressed carrier method of deriving multiple communication channels from a common transmission medium is now almost 40 years old. The first systems to provide good telephone circuits by this method came into widespread use in 1927, followed by large scale installation of 3-channel systems about 1933. By 1938 12-channel systems had been applied to trunkline telephony, and soon thereafter equipment was available to provide really large numbers of channels over a coaxial cable. Current developments include the application of radio relay to the telephone plant and carrier systems designed for simplification of application and reduction of equipment cost."
"The magnetic clutch is now in use in many different fields. With proper design it can be adapted for use with 1,000-horsepower installations as well as with those of fractional horsepower."
"THE INITIAL OBJECTIVE of this AIEE Joint Subcommittee was to collect information on the frequency and severity of out-of-phase high-voltage switching operations and then to decide if further action was justified. It was felt that the Committeemembers, through their business and committee affiliations, would be in a position to give a reasonably representative picture of high-voltage out-of-phase switching troubles; therefore, as a first step a questionnaire was sent out to the Committee members on June 15, 1948. It was hoped that sufficient material could be obtained this way and that the industry in general could be spared another questionnaire."
"Basic impulse insulation levels were established in 1941, and although many improvements have been added to systems since then, no changes have been made in the levels. This article summarizes the present knowledge of the factors on which these levels are based and recommends a new series of such levels."

C, on January 10, 11, and 12, 195l. Patterned after the successful 1949 conference, this forum will offer those interested in high-frequency measurements and measuring apparatus an opportunity to learn of new developments and exchange information on recent advances in the art."
"The Philadelphia Section, under the leadership of Chairman S. Reid Warren, Jr., is making a bid for more students this year, and as part of this program a 2-day tour tosix affiliated Student Branches and also avisit to the Wilmington Subsection was made.On November 6 and 7, C. G. Veinott, Vice-President of District 2 (Middle Eastern) and J. S.

"The regular meeting of the AIEE Board of Directors was held at the Skirvin Hotel, Oklahoma City, Okla. on October 26, 1950, during the Fall General Meeting of the Institute."
"Very few members of the Institute are interested in its election procedure, but from those who took the trouble to send in the coupon in President Le Clair's article in the October issue (EE, Oct '50, p 855–6) it can be deduced that the present system of election of officers is satisfactory."
"The 1950 Edison medal of the AIEE has been awarded by the Edison Medal Committee to Otto B. Blackweil, Assistant Vice President (retired) of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) “for his pioneer contributions to the art of telephone transmission,” and will be presented to him at the AIEE Winter General Meeting."

"By 1954 there will be only 15,000 engineering graduates. President LeClair discusses the reasons for this trend of fewer men entering the engineering profession, and suggests four thoughts for consideration by members."
"Modem research developments and design techniques have been incorporated in a new high-current impulse generator shipped to the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, by the General Electric Company's Transformer and Allied Product Divisions, Pittsfield, Mass."
"Unless drastic action is taken to increase the supply of engineering freshmen and to continue the training programs of World War II, there will be a cumulative shortage of over 40,000 engineering graduates by 1954. On the basis of Dean Hollister's report, the Engineering Manpower Commission of the Engineers Joint Council recommended a 4-point program to the National Security Resources Board (see news item on page 179)."
"Although the potential engineer often gets his first practical knowledge of electricity in a school laboratory, few safety precautions are taught in these laboratories. Suggestions are given here for increasing safety awareness and decreasing hazards in experimental electrical laboratories of schools and industrial plants."
"THE GROWTH of modern low-voltage systems has advanced so far that now the low-voltage air circuit breaker must meet requirements which were unheard of ten years ago."
"RECENTLY there has been a heartening trend in biological research toward closer collaboration between the physical and the biological sciences. This article is a résumé of a program of this nature being pursued at the University of Pennsylvania. In order that such a program be well balanced, research, education, and instrumentation are all required. These three topics are discussed and new technical developments are described. Work done in the field of electrocardiography may be cited as one example of research. In explanation of the distribution of potentials on the body surface arising from heart action, an ingenious theory has evolved which is widely accepted. However, some of the fundamental postulates on which this theory is based are open to question. Chief among these is the assumption that for electrocardiographic purposes the body behaves as a homogenous volume conductor. Through the years, numerous attempts have been made to check this assumption both by measuring directly the resistivities of the various tissues within the body and by more indirect means. Investigators have reached widely differing conclusions from their experiments so that there is still no definitive answer to the question. This past work has been reviewed and evaluated and a series of experiments is under way which, it is hoped, will throw further light on the subject."
"Newest addition to the Commonwealth Edison Company is the Ridgeland Station with an ultimate capacity of 600,000 kw. The result of long-range planning, the station has many modern features including centralized control, cyclone-fired furnaces, and hydrogen-cooled generators."
"TUi 79-ton spider being welded at the East Pittsburgh, Pa., plant of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation it the inner framework sat the rotor of one of the 108,000-kw waterwheel generators for the Grand Coulee Dam power plant. The rotor measures 31 ieet in diameter and, when completed, will weigh 542 tons. It will rotate at 120 rpm"
"THE NAVAL Research Laboratory Electronic Digital Computer (NAREC) is to be a general-purpose electronic digital computing machine capable of high-speed computations with binary numbers having a precision of 44 digits (about 13 decimal digits). The high-speed and precision characteristics of the computer will make it especially valuable not only for reduction of experimental data but also for the solution of systems of linear equations with a large number of unknowns, nonlinear differential equations, and other problems involving computations of similar magnitude. The design of the NAREC was begun in July 1949, and it is hoped that the computer will be placed in operation by January 1952 with an additional six months being required to place the computer on an efficient operating schedule."
"IN THE LAST 30 years the rise of dialing requirements for local and long distance circuits, coupled with increased plant construction costs, has made the older types of carrier telephone systems obsolescent. It was found that there is a distinct field for medium-haul carrier telephone systems, capable of transmitting up to about 12 decibels above, and receiving down to about 15 decibels below, the level at the switchboard at the transmitting end, and providing circuits with 2-wire net circuit losses of two to six decibels. Such a system should transmit voice frequencies from about 300 to 2,700 cycles with a rather flat characteristic. The modulator and demodulator carrier oscillators should be stable to about three cycles to permit use of voice-frequency carrier telegraph systems."
"The author presents a review of the procedure involved in becoming a registered engineer and its advantages to the individual and the profession as a whole. A list of national registration boards and boards of engineering examiners is included."
"IN RECENT YEARS the air-insulated metal-enclosed high-capacity bus has come into wide use in central stations. These busses are built in a variety of designs with three basic configurations: nonsegregated phase, segregated phase, and isolated phase. They vary mainly in construction between phases. In addition to this, the only outstanding difference is the presence or absence of considerable circulating current in the bus housings."
"Circuit-breaker problems at very high voltages have been studied in Sweden to show what will happen to the circuit breakers on the new 380-kv line. A discussion of the tests and their results are presented here."
"The general principles of the application of information theory to system design is discussed here, and an example is given showing its use in studying the Private Line Air Traffic Control Communication System."
"CURVES OF impedance and admittance in the complex plane for various combinations of 2-terminal 3-element linear dissipative networks are extremely useful in the solution of many electrical engineering problems because of the direct, straightforward manner in which they show graphically the resistive and reactive components of complex impedance and admittance, the magnitude of impedance and admittance, and the phase shift at all frequencies between zero and infinity. The curves also reveal that the 16 possible combinations of 2-terminal 3-element networks fall into four main groups of four networks each."
"THE ratio of sending-end to receiving-end power for a transmission line, or other 4-pole apparatus, is"
"THE DEVELOPMENT of the combustion gas turbine as a new type of prime mover for power generation has required the parallel development of suitable controls. The control being used at present on General Electric gas turbines provides for semiautomatic starting and stopping of the unit for speed and load control and for protection of the unit under abnormal conditions."
"A new local video distribution system has been developed which provides equalization and amplification of signals transmitted over links between television studios, transmitters, coaxial cables, and microwave networks. The equipment consists of a transmitting terminal, an intermediate repeater with cable equalizers, and a receiving terminal."
"A HORN-GAP switch has limitations in its ability to successfully open a circuit because of the restricted space available for expansion of the arc. It is not the length of the arc but its spread, and where it goes, that is important in switch operation. The clearance available for the spread of the arc must be such that the arc cannot form a short circuit between phases or to ground."
"ELECTRIC CONDUITS of one type or another have been in use since the beginning of the electric power industry. Construction practices and materials are fairly well standardized within companies. There is no accepted single standard for the industry, and it is probable that no single standard could be designed that would be satisfactory. However, since the fundamentals and basic design considerations are the same throughout the industry, any discussion concerning these principles is pertinent to all conduit design. In recent years, probably the only new development involving conduit construction is the installation of high-voltage transmission cable in steel pipe with gas or oil under high pressure. The cost and lack of flexibility usually restrict this new system to high-capacity transmission uses."
"THE FACTORS affecting transient operation of a voltage-regulated d-c system have been studied empirically in the past, but a need has been felt to have a greater analytical understanding of the problem in aircraft system work. A step in this direction is to draw upon linear servomechanism and closed-loop control theory. An analysis of the carbon-pile regulator has been published with this purpose in mind.1"
"The problems involved in testing outdoor switches to determine their effectiveness as ice-breaking mechanisms are numerous. This article describes an ice test and the design features of a switch which can be operated under severe icing conditions."
"TRANSIENT PROBLEMS, such as closing a switch at a certain time, or throwing a load on a machine suddenly, or applying an impulse to a system, involve the use of discontinuous functions. These may be expressed in one type of notation by multiplying any given function by the Heaviside Null Unit Function H(x,x0), which is equal to zero when x < x0 and is equal to unity when x > x0. Similarly, in studying the fields due to point sources in a continuous medium the impulse function which is the derivative of the Null Unit Function H′(x, x0) arises."
"Saturable reactors now are being used in magnetic amplifiers because they are capable of handling larger loads than vacuum tubes can and they have stable performance when converting d-c signals to alternating. Presented here is a design of a magnetic modulator in a control system which is otherwise entirely electronic."
"WHEN, following World War II, the use of telephone carrier circuits became widespread on independent telephone lines of short and medium electrical lengths, manufacturers followed the practice previously established on long-line applications and supplied suppressed carrier equipment."
"IN A modern power transformer only the insulation, oil, and fibrous materials, show appreciable deterioration under normal operating conditions. Consequently, it is only natural that much effort has been applied to the problem of preventing or retarding this deterioration. Many schemes for this purpose have been devised; open air breather, dehydrating breather, conservators, gas-oil seals, sealed tanks, inert gas atmospheres, and thermosiphon clay filters are examples. These devices have one or two objectives: to prevent the entrance or to minimize the effects of moisture, or to exclude oxygen and minimize the effects of oxidation. The simplest and one of the most effective methods is to seal the transformer tank."
"An instrument has been developed to measure the insulation resistance of either an a-c or d-c system without removing the system from operation. The present voltmeter method of performing this operation involves the taking of a number of readings and applying these to a formula, but the new instrument makes it possible to get the information which is desired directly."
"In the past seven years the Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., has purchased 580 totally enclosed fan-cooled motors with an aggregate' rating of 52,000 horsepower for major auxiliary application in new plant installation. It has been possible to justify the higher cost of totally enclosed motors on the basis of reduced maintenance and greater reliability."
"That a better exchange of ideas should exist between manufacturers of vacuum tubes and the designers of computer circuits was one of the main conclusions reached at the Conference on Electron Tubes for Computers.The conference was sponsored by the AIEE and Institute of Radio Engineers, in collaboration with the Panel on Electron Tubes of the Research and Development Board, at Haddon Hall Hotel, Atlantic City N. J. December 11–13, 1950 and was attended by more than 300 engineers from all parts of the country and from as far away as Canada and England. A great deal of the credit for the success of the conference is due to Dr. C. V. L. Smith, head of the Computer Section, Office of Naval Research."

"Recent research in the Engineering Machanics Section of the Rational Bureau of Standards (NBS) has resulted in an improvement of the Ramberg vacuum-tube accelerometer which NBS developed in 1946 for the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics with the co-operation of Sylvania Electric Products, Inc. The new pickup provides more sensitive and reliable acceleration measurements than did the earlier version which, despite slight erratic changes during its operation, has been successfully applied to both field and laboratory acceleration measurements. Among such uses have been acceleration measurements on pilot ejection devices for high-speed aircraft, in landing impact tests for model aircraft, as well as on aircraft in actual flight."
"The success of America's industrial mobilization program is menaced by shortages of engineers, with the situation held “desperate” in some plants. Critical scarcities exist in the electronic, aviation, power equipment, ordnance, and machine tool industries."

"The Edison Medal for 1950 has been awarded to Otto B. Blackwell “for his pioneer contributions to the art of telephone transmission.” This medal is awarded annually for meritorious achievement in electrical science or electrical engineering or the electrical arts. The presentation, the 40th since the medal was originated in 1904, is a fitting tribute to Otto B. Blackwell for his achievements in telephone transmission and related fields."
"IN 1906 one of the graduating class at Massachusetts Institute of Technology was a tall, thin, soft-spoken boy from Bourne, on Cape Cod, Mass. This boy was destined to have the distinguished career which we are celebrating today."
"I AM VERY deeply moved by the award to me of this Edison Medal with all its significance in the electrical engineering world. A medal which commemorates the genius of Thomas A. Edison. A medal which has gained added values during 40 years from the outstanding men who have received it. In the Bell Telephone system we remember that the sixth award was to Alexander Graham Bell. This was later followed by awards to John J. Carty, Frank B. Jewett, Bancroft Gherardi, and George A. Campbell. Every part of the electrical engineering world is similarly represented by notable people. It is indeed a great honor to have one's name appear on a roster of such men. With great appreciation, I thank the Institute which through its medal committee placed my name there."
"The Hoover Medal for 1950 was awarded to Karl Taylor Compton, Chairman of the Corporation of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The medal is a joint award of the AIEE, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers, and the American Society of Civil Engineers; Doctor Compton is the 12th recipient of this medal “to a fellow engineer for distinguished public service.”"
"NO ONE COULD help but be deeply appreciative of the honor of being selected as a recipient of the Hoover Medal. Few, if any, of the recipients will have had such reason as I for a feeling of humility when we compare our attempts to serve our community and nation with the high standards set by the donor of this medal, Conrad N. Lauer, and by the great American, Herbert Hoover, in whose honor the medal was named and who was its first recipient."
"A new microfilm recorder has been designed by Bell and Howell Company, Chicago, 111., which photographs on 16-millimeter film important papers which are needed for records. The recorder automatically takes care of lens opening and shutter speed. Lighting and film rating are perfect, so the operator does not need to worry about them. Keeping the electricity under control is handled by a device made by the Sola Electric Company, also of Chicago."
"Vannevar Bush, President of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, was awarded the John Fritz Medal for 1951 “for outstanding contributions to his country and to his fellow men.” The medal is awarded annually by the four national engineering societies: AIEE, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers, and the American Society of Civil Engineers, for notable scientific or industrial achievements, regardless of nationality or sex."
"IN THANKING you for the honor which you have bestowed upon me, I wish to emphasize some aspects of the responsibilities and opportunities of the engineering profession in the present emergency. For the men upon whom the John Fritz Medal has been conferred in the past—and in whose company I am happy to find myself—are men who have helped to build the industrial democracy of the present day. Merely to mention a few of their names—Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Lord Kelvin, Elihu Thomson, General Goethals, Charles Kettering—is to call forth the achievements by which they have given us not only a more efficient world but, as we fully believe, a better world. I am deeply appreciative of the honor of being counted worthy to be included as one of their number."
"At the National Bureau of Standards most precise methods are used for measuring and determining exact values of electrical units. The testing and calibration work of the Bureau is available for an appropriate fee to anyone who needs this high-accuracy service."
"Motions of the body become amenable to the disciplines of control and communication engineering after they have been learned. They are shown to involve presetting, closed-loop operation, and prediction."
"Many people still feel there are only three professions: divinity, law, and medicine. Why is engineering not considered a profession by some? To answer this, Mr. Henson gives the historical background of the profession, the beginnings of the engineering societies, and the development of engineering schools."
"The design of liquid-cooled turbine generators has been simplified by eliminating some complications first thought necessary and enumerated in an earlier paper.1 The external deaerators and small ducts below the rotor's main slots may not be omitted; the stator can be cooled with water instead of by an insulating liquid; and complications associated with hydrogen may be obviated in small and moderate size generators by operating in an air atmosphere."
"Corona effects on extra-high-voltage lines have been investigated at the site of the Tidd power plant. In making these tests, the effects of voltage changes and various weather conditions on corona were observed."
"Equipment for community dial offices which serve small or sparsely settled communities is described in this article. The discussion covers service features, equipment features, and maintenance facilities."
"BECAUSE of increasing costs, the design of dial telephone central office buildings for small communities is being scrutinized by most telephone operating companies with the object of specifying the most economical type of construction consistent with the requirements. The general building design features are determined chiefly by the type of community and the climate, while the detailed design is governed by the housing requirements of the dial equipment."
"The problem of interference of nearby stations was one of the greatest problems which had to be overcome to permit the satisfactory use of mobile telephone service. This article tells of a study made of the interference encountered on one highway mobile telephone system and the measures made to counteract it."
"Submergible pumps with diameters from five to eight inches and lengths up to 28 feet are being used to pump oil and water from deep oil wells. These units are being used to pump volumes as great as 15,000 barrels of fluid during one day."
"SEVERAL YEARS ago, the question of overloading transformers for short times arose. This in turn brought up the question of insulation deterioration with both temperature and time."
"Tele-Paris, television station of the French capital, will offer early this year about 25 hours of telecasts weekly at the high definition of 819 lines. The announcement was made by Albert Gazier, Minister of Information, in a recent report to the Press Committee of the French National Assembly. Simultaneously with these new telecasts, 25 hours of telecasts on 441 lines will continue in the Paris region until at least 1958. The standard line definition in the United States is 525. The recendy installed television transmitter at Lille, France, telecasts 15 hours per week on the 819-line definition. French television has made successful experiments with color television. In 1951, France will spend 115 million francs (approximately $330,000) to finance its television programs."
"Repeaters designed for long life are incorporated in the cable structure and are laid as part of the cable of the recently installed Key West—Havana submarine telephone cable system. To eliminate the need for servicing the repeaters, the components were designed so that parts would not have to be replaced for 20 years or more."
"Jack, the physicist, is continuing his lectures to Alter Ego and his friends on the basic principles underlying dynamo-electric machines."
"New studies have been made of the aging of Class-B insulating material in nitrogen, and it has been found that the insulations follow the same behavior rules in nitrogen as they do in air. However, the tests indicate Class-B material in nitrogen can be used in temperatures where the more expensive Class-H insulations were formerly used."

Titus, Canada Wire and Cable Company, Limited, Toronto, has been holding active meetings since the early fall and has planned an extensive schedule of inspection trips, in addition to the regular full program of technical sessions."
"That the radio-frequency portion of the spectrum is in a state of expansion was evidenced at the second conference on High Frequency Measurements held in Washington, D. C, January 10–12, 1951, which was attended by 549 engineers from all parts of this country and Canada. The technical program consisted of four sessions on different categories of measurements and an evening demonstration session together with inspection trips during the day. This conference was held in Washington as a part of the Semicentennial celebration of the National Bureau of Standards. The Joint AIEE-Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) Committee on High Frequency Measurements, the AIEE Committee on Instruments and Measurements, the IRE Professional Group on Instrumentation, and the National Bureau of Standards co-operated in organizing the conference."

"Radiological hazards after an atomic bomb explosion vary according to whether it is an air burst, water burst, or ground burst. The Federal Civil Defense Administration has tentative specifications for different radiation-detection instruments. A warning is given to prospective instrument buyers regarding instruments they might buy for personal use in civil defense."
"A study has been made of the industrial applications of electrical power generation. It was found that of the total 344,400,000,000 kilowatt hours of power generated in 1949 in the United States, 84.3 per cent was generated by utilities and Government authorities and 15.7 per cent was generated by industrial plants."
"Two experimental models of devices for the intensification of X-ray fluorescent images were put into use in September 1950. These devices have a brightness amplification slightly over 100 times and enable detection of a 3-per cent thickness difference."
"OWING to the complex dielectric structure of the insulation of a cable, few, if any, attempts have been made to evaluate the stresses in the oil channels in terms of the dimensions of the complete cable and the basic dielectric properties of the insulating materials. A simple Analytical solution of the problem is available, however, if two assumptions are made:"
"THE ELECTRIC FENCE consists of one or more bare wires, such as ordinary barbed wire, insulated from ground, which are energized from a device called a controller. An animal or human touching the wire completes the circuit to ground, thereby receiving a painful but harmless shock. The wire is strung on insulators supported by lightweight poles at a vertical distance about three-quarters of the height of the animal."
"What is wrong with the curricula in engineering schools? Is the lecture method used satisfactory? What are the problems facing the engineering graduate? Mr. La Pierre, of the Columbia University Department of Electrical Engineering, offers his suggestions for improving engineering education."
"Centralization of boiler, turbine, generator, and auxiliary controls has been introduced into generating plants so that one person can know all the conditions in the plant; thus the plant can be operated most efficiently. This method also cuts down the necessary amount of control-room area."
"Industrial application of ultraviolet radiations has expanded recently to the extent that electrical engineers now frequently must be concerned with various types of ultraviolet lamps and their associated electric control equipment. These applications range from germicidal uses to sterilization of liquids and various photochemical processes."
"Increased safety of train operation is effected by the continuously controlled cab signal which may be augmented by means for automatically applying the brakes in case cab signal changes calling for a reduction in speed are ignored or predetermined speed limits are exceeded."
"Weaving shutdes, traditionally made of dogwood or persimmon wood for high impact strength and retention of smooth contours for long periods of continuous operation, can have longer life by surfacing the shutde on two or more sides with hard fiber sheet. Electronic dielectric heating techniques have been adapted to shutde bonding to improve the quality of the bond, reduce its cost, and increase production. Use of a radio-frequency generator for heating plus an automatic hydraulic press, which gives uniform pressure on both the straight and curved portions of the shutde face, produces a uniform bond the length of the shuttle—a bond that will withstand the hard impact of the picker stick as it drives the shutde across the loom."
"IN COMMUTATOR-type motors, the current is reversed in the armature coils as the commutator bars, to which they are connected, pass under the brushes. During the period of reversal the coils are short-circuited due to the brush making contact with two bars to which the ends of the coils are connected. The current in the short-circuited coil is determined by the voltage which is generated in that coil and the resistance of the coil, brush, and brush contact."
"This article discloses the total power required to perform all the operations of the four principal phases of the petroleum industry, drilling, production, transportation, and refining. All power requirements are reduced to electric energy equivalent of the kilowatt hour. The ratio of “purchased” to “generated” electric energy also is shown."
"THERE ARE formulas available by which it is possible to calculate the peak of the first cycle of magnetizing inrush current for a transformer. There have been no convenient formulas available for determining the maximum values of successive cycles of current. The usual approach has been to use a step-by-step process of mechanical integration that is quite time-consuming and usually is not worth the effort. Below are presented approximate formulas for determining the maximum values of the successive cycles of current that will be satisfactory for the majority of cases where this information is desired."

The general formulas may be reduced to the usual rationalized or unrationalized forms or to the Gaussian or Heaviside forms by the substitution of tabulated numerical values of the constants n and u in the general form."
"THE DESIGN LIMITS of rural distribution circuits usually are determined by permissible voltage drop rather than the thermal limitations of the conductor. Presently overloaded circuits supplying power at inadequate voltage levels are the result of conservative estimates of load growth. Overloaded circuits highlight the need for inexpensive voltage correction equipment."

"Twenty-four years have elapsed since the first large-scale machine switching tandem system was designed and installed for service in Los Angeles. As an intermediate switching center, the tandem office enabled operators to use the dial method of operation for establishing interexchange telephone connections over the associated trunking network. During the intervening years, it has facilitated the rapid handling of telephone calls between the various communities in and around the city."

"The success of a modern military aircraft depends on the successful integration of a suitable airframe, appropriate armament, and a variety of complex radio systems. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss the radio systems performance requirements of modern military aircraft, particularly with respect to the performance required of the airborne antenna systems. On the basis of this discussion, we will survey the available antenna system techniques to determine how well the presently available solutions meet these requirements and, when possible, the direction in which further efforts can most profitably be directed."
"John V.N. Granger, the author of \"Systems Considerations in Aircraft Design,\" which was published in the Transactions of the IRE Professional Group on Airborne Electronics, Paper 5lPGllOl (PGAE-1), has brought to the attention of the editors an error in Figures 5 and 6. The corrected figures are reprinted herein."
"It has recently been discovered that it is possible to reduce skin effect losses in transmission lines by properly laminating the conductors and adjusting the velocity of transmission of the waves. The theory for such laminated transmission lines is presented in the case of planar systems for both infinitesimally thin laminae and laminae of finite thickness. A transmission line completely filled with laminated material is discussed. An analysis is given of the modes of transmission in a laminated line, and of the problem of terminating such a line."
"Shockley, Sparks, and Teal have recently described the physical properties of a new kind of transistor. Preliminary studies of circuit performance show that it is a stable, high gain, quiet amplifier of considerable practical interest. This paper analyzes the performance of a few early experimental units."
"A photographic method using mechanical scanning for displaying the space patterns of sound and microwaves is described. A probe pick-up scans the sound or microwave field and the amplified probe output controls the brilliance of a small lamp affixed to the probe. A camera set at time exposure records the light intensity variations of the lamp as it moves across the scanned field, forming a pattern on the film of the amplitude distribution. Phase fronts can be delineated by adding a constant amplitude signal to the probe output. Photographs are included which show: sound and microwave patterns of lenses, diffraction at a straight edge and disk, refraction by a prism, diffusion of sound by a divergent lens, and radiation from loud speakers. Also, by transposition of source and receiver, directional patterns of transducers acting as microphones are obtained which (by reciprocity) appear identical with their radiation patterns. This provides a means for examining the directional characteristics of non-reversible transducers such as a carbon microphone. A calibration method is described which allows the relative value of the field intensities to be determined."
"The functions and typical designs of translators as applied to automatic telephone switching systems are first reviewed. The fundamental similarity of some existing translation schemes is noted and a discussion given of the factors which can be juggled to obtain economic application of such schemes."
"This paper reviews some of the assumptions made and some of the general problems involved in analyzing the behavior of electron streams coupled to circuits. It explains why a wave approach is used. The propagation constant of the wave is obtained in terms of the properties of the electron stream and the impedance of the circuit. Some general properties of waves are discussed. The importance of fitting boundary conditions in the solution of an actual problem is discussed, and examples, including that of “backward-gaining” waves, are discussed."
"A major handicap in the evaluation of different designs and manufacturing processes, in respect to efficiency of space utilization inside the sheath of multi-pair telephone cable, has been the lack of a simple and accurate method of measuring the dielectric constant of such cable pairs. This paper describes a simple non-destructive method of determining both the interaxial spacing between conductors of a cable pair and the dielectric constant. An important by-product of the work is the demonstration of the fact that ε = L × C is not a valid means of determining the dielectric constant of cable pairs."
"The circuits considered have N accessible terminals and are operated by gangs of selector switches. Synthesis of any N-terminal switching function is accomplished. The synthesis method is proved to be economical in the sense that the switching functions which can be synthesized by any other method using much fewer contacts comprise a vanishingly small fraction of the total of all possible switching functions."
"The calibrations of bridge networks used in developmental tests on coaxial cable are obtained by comparison of the networks with calculable standards of impedance consisting of a group of short-length precision copper coaxial lines. The standards are calculable by reason of the availability of precise formulae relating the distributed primary constants to the measurable physical constants and dimensions of the coaxials. This paper outlines the constructional problems and design features of a group of such standards of impedance which provide a range of values over a broad band of frequencies."
"Instantaneous compandors have found useful application in time-division systems. This paper discusses the theory of the instantaneous compandor and evaluates the noise advantage when instantaneous companding is applied to telephone channels. The noise advantage depends upon the noise standard of the system. If the standard corresponds to that of a toll telephone system, a noise advantage of about 20 db is possible."
"Up to this point this review of coil loading has been primarily in terms of transmission features of the loading systems and the coils, and development economics, and for this reason the references to potting developments have been brief, so as to minimize diversions from the main theme. A complete chronological review of all important aspects of the potting development work would require much more space than is available for this present article. On the other hand, because of the substantial importance of the potting developments in the economics of loading, more should be said than was included in the brief references in Parts II and III of the story."
"In a number of applications for polyethylene, particularly cable sheaths and cosmetic containers, it has been found that under certain conditions failure of the polyethylene results in a cracking of the plastic. Considerable information is available to show that in an unstressed condition polyethylene is highly resistant to a wide variety of chemical environments such as alcohols, soaps, and fatty oils. However, when polyethy lene is exposed to these environments under polyaxial stress it fails by cracking."
"DR. DAVISSON, affectionately known to his large circle of friends as “Davy,” joined the research section of the Engineering Department of the Western Electric Company in March, 1917 to participate in its World War I programs. He came on leave of absence from Carnegie Institute of Technology with the intention of returning to his academic post at the close of the war, but remained with its engineering organization, later to become Bell Telephone Laboratories, until 1946, when he retired at the age of sixty-five. He then accepted a research professorship in the Department of Physics at the University of Virginia."
"THE very first piece of work which is published by a physicist who is destined to be great is not often outstanding; but sometimes it has curious affinities, accidental rather than causal, with aspects of the work that was to come thereafter. In the first paper published by C. J. Davisson, we find him working with electrons, concentrating them into a beam by the agency of a magnetic field, directing them against a metal target, and looking to see whether rays proceed from the target. True, the electrons came from a radioactive substance, and therefore were much faster than those of his later experiments. True also, he did not actually focus the electron-beam. True also, the rays for which he was looking were X-rays, and in these he took no further interest. Yet in nearly all of his subsequent researches he was to use some of the principles of electron-focussing or electron-microscopy; in many, he was to look for things that were emitted by the target on which his electrons fell. This maiden paper was presented before the American Physical Society at its meeting in Washington in April 1909; the printed version may be found in the Physical Review, page 469 of volume 28 of the year 1909. It was signed from Princeton University, whither Davisson had gone as a graduate student."
"Contrast and resolution in electron micrographs from thin replica films are determined by the geometrical relationships between the directions of incidence of the condensing atom beam and the local surface normal, during film formation by evaporation in vacuo, and the direction of incidence of the electron beam, during subsequent exposure in the microscope. Replica films may be formed of any material suitable for vacuum evaporation. Metal atoms in general lend to stick where they strike, moving only short distances, 100 Å or less, to nucleating centers where they form small crystallites. Oxides such as silica and silicon monoxide, and also the semi-metal germanium, form amorphous films. A portion of the incident material, about 50% in the case of silica, migrates large distances, 5000 Å or more, before finally condensing; the remainder sticks where it first strikes the surface. The existence of a minimum perceptible mass thickness difference, about 0.7 μUg/cm2 for 50 kv electrons, results in an optimum replica mass thickness of about 10 μg/cm2. The resolution of the replica film is proportional to its linear thickness and hence is inversely proportional to its density. Micrographs of silica, chromium, gold-manganin, aluminum, aluminum-platinum-chromium and germanium replicas are shown. The importance of stereoscopic methods in interpretation of micrographs is discussed."
"In a simple electron gun consisting of a cathode and two apertured planes held at different potentials the apertures act as electron lenses. When the gun is immersed in a uniform axial magnetic field the aperture spacings and potentials can be chosen so that the emerging electrons have no radial velocities."
"A general solution of the electron stream equations is developed for a parallel plane diode, under the assumption that the electron velocity is single valued. This solution contains all particular solutions. It serves to unify the wave theory and the particle theory of electron flow, and it is an approximation for multi-velocity streams over a wide range of conditions."
"The paper describes a cathode ray television receiving tube incorporating several unique features. The tube was designed and constructed by Dr. C. J. Davisson and was used in some of the early demonstrations of television transmission over the coaxial cable."
"Features of the dynamical or wave mechanical theory of electron diffraction pertinent to the interpretation of electron images of crystalline materials are briefly discussed. It is shown that the type of image obtained depends upon the local bending of the crystal, the coherent crystal size and the state of internal strain. The absence of extinction contours seen in annealed aluminum is an indication of the presence of internal strains."
"This paper gives the results of some calculations of the reflection coefficient for electrons incident normally on a plane face of a metallic crystal. The physical situation is treated as being one-dimensional; and it is assumed that the potential energy of an electron is a sinusoidal function of distance inside the crystal, and obeys the classical image force law outside the crystal. The reflection coefficient is computed as a function of the energy of the incident electrons, over the range from 0 to 20 electron volts, for a variety of values of the parameters which define the model of the crystal."
"The chief conclusions from these studies are given in the Introduction. Table II summarizes the adsorption properties of W on W and Ba on W. These properties vary with the crystal plane and are given for five planes. The extent to which these planes develop depends on T and the applied field, F. The temperature at which W atoms migrate on W at detectable rates depends on the plane and on F, and varies from 800 to 1200°K."
"Platinum contacts are brought together 60 times a second, discharging on each closure a condenser of 0.01 mf capacity charged to 40 volts. The heat flowing along each electrode is calculated from a temperature difference measured by thermocouples, and from this is determined the energy dissipated at each contact. If there is no arc on closure, the energy is the same on the two contacts, and is small. If there is an arc between the contacts before they touch, about 58 per cent of its energy is dissipated upon the anode and about 42 per cent upon the cathode. The distribution is the same in an arc between clean “inactive” electrodes and in the entirely different kind of arc occurring between carbonized “active” electrodes. This information may be significant in developing an understanding of closure arcs which are the sole cause of the erosion of electrical contacts on closure."
"Unstrained single crystals of barium titanate can be detwinned under the influence of an electric field at elevated temperature, but strained crystals cannot. It seems probable that this is also true of crystals in a polycrystalline body such as a ceramic."
"The general properties of the longitudinal modes in cylinders and slabs are developed with the aid of the close formal analogy between the dispersion equations for the two cases."
"The elastic constants of nickel crystals, and their variation with magnetic field (ΔE effect), have been measured by a 10-megacycle ultrasonic pulsing method. The constants of three crystals agree well with one another when the crystals are magnetically saturated, but vary with domain distribution when demagnetized. The maximum ΔE effect observed is much less (3%) than has been observed at lower frequencies (20%). By measuring the ΔE effect and the decrement of polycrystalline rods at low frequencies, it is shown that the small effect observed at 10 megacycles is due to a relaxation in the domain wall motion due to microeddy-current damping. From the initial slope of the decrement-frequency curve, and also from the frequency of maximum decrement, the size of the average domain is found to he about 0.04 mm. Actual domains in single nickel crystals have been observed optically by Williams, who finds domain widths of 0.02 to 0.2 mm."
"The data of E. J. Ryder on the mobility of electrons in electric fields up to 40,000 volts per cm are analyzed. The mobility decreases many fold due to the influence of scattering by optical modes and due to increases of electron energy. It is estimated that electron “temperatures” as high as 4000°K have been produced in specimens having temperatures of atomic vibration of 300° K. The critical drift velocity above which there are deviations from Ohm's law is about 2.6 × 106 cm/sec. This is three times higher than the elementary theory and on explanation in terms of complex energy surfaces is proposed."
"Note on Radiation due to Impact of Beta Particles upon Solid Matter."
"The TD-2 microwave radio relay system is a recent addition to the telephone plant facilities for long distance communication. It is designed to supplement the coaxial system and to provide greatly expanded facilities for nationwide transmission of broad-band signals such as television pictures or large groups of message circuits. The system makes use of many microwave repeaters located 25 to 30 miles apart in line-of-sight steps. The great variety and number of components which make up such a system require the engineering of all components to close tolerances. This paper describes the system in some detail from the standpoints of overall objectives, component designs to meet such objectives and facilities for the maintenance of overall performance."
"This paper is a general review of deterioration processes in polymers. It is pointed out that changes in properties with aging are usually the result of chemical reaction with components of the atmosphere. The mechanisms of these reactions and some methods of preventing or retarding them are discussed."
"AS THE demand for long distance telephone circuits has increased, new transmission systems capable of handling more channels per conductor have been developed. Also the advent of television has created a demand for broad band channels for network facilities. One of the latest developments now nearing completion is the L3 Coaxial System."
"This paper describes the determination of the first four semi-invariants of the distribution of the average, over an arbitrary time interval, of traffic carried by a telephone system with an infinite number of trunks, during a period of statistical equilibrium. Both finite and infinite numbers of independent call sources are considered, and the distribution function of call holding times is left general."
"For certain speech studies at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, it has been necessary to design some rather specialized magnetic recording equipment. In connection with this work, it has been found experimentally and theoretically that introducing a spacing of d inches between the reproducing head and the recording medium decreases the reproduced voltage by 54.6 (d/λ) decibels when the recorded wavelength is λ inches. For short wavelengths this loss is many decibels even when the effective spacing is only a few ten-thousandths of an inch. On this basis it is argued that imperfect magnetic contact between reproducing head and recording medium may account for much of the high-frequency loss which is experimentally observed."
"The subject equations are investigated with the aim of establishing some general properties of the flow fields which they describe, including the existence or non-existence of classes of exact solutions having certain formal properties. The results include a number of geometric characteristics of the vector fields involved, a suggestive reformulation of the partial differential equations restricting carrier concentration and electrostatic potential, and several classes of exact solutions involving arbitrary constants and/or functions. Of particular interest is a family of solutions in closed form for the steady-state, no-recombination case involving an arbitrary harmonic function in three dimensions."
"If speech is passed through an instantaneous compressor, the original speech frequency spectrum is substantially widened. It is known that instantaneously compressed speech can be transmitted over a medium with a passband no wider than that occupied by the uncompressed speech, and the original signals recovered without distortion. The conditions required for such distortionless transmission are examined. The analysis indicates that more severe requirements must be imposed on the attenuation and phase characteristics of the system when this reduced bandwidth mode of operation is used. The practical value of this exchange of transmission requirements is a matter for experimental determination."
"CONTINUOUS loading, i.e., the addition of uniformly distributed inductance, was studied theoretically in the Bell System several years before theoretical work started on coil loading. This early work of John Stone Stone, then a member of the headquarters technical staff of the American Bell Telephone Company, resulted in the issue to him on March 2, 1897 of a U.S. Patent (575,275) describing a “bi-metallic” wire cable."
"A full automatic teletypewriter message switching system has been developed for use in private line networks involving one or more switching centers and a multiplicity of local or long distance lines, each of which may have one or more stations. This system provides fastte letypewriter communication from any station to any other station or group of stations in the network."
"The N1 Carrier System is a 12-channel, double-sideband system for single cable application. It provides low loss, stable, high velocity service for toll and exchange circuits in the range from 15 or 20 miles to 200 miles. Units and sub-assemblies are miniaturized and arranged on a plug-in basis. Emphasis has been placed on reduction in cost of components, as well as simplification of manufacturing methods, engineering, installation and maintenance. Economy is achieved by many novel features, principal among which is a built-in low cost compandor. By compressing and expanding the volume range of speech, the compandor permits much higher tolerance of noise and crosstalk, thereby substantially lowering the cost of both line and terminal facilities. Other important features are self contained dialing and supervisory signaling, an individual channel regulator, and automatic equalization through the use of “frequency frogging,” or interchange of high- and low-frequency groups at each repeater."
"Transmission by pulse code modulation presents inviting possibilities in the field of television in that information may be relayed by many repeater stations without deterioration. In a PCM system, the informal ion signal is periodically sampled and its instantaneous amplitude described by a group of pulses according to a pec-set code. These pulse groups occur at the sampling rate and constitute the transmitted signal. In this process an operation known as amplitude quantization is required."
"A new method of estimating the entropy and redundancy of a language is described. This method exploits the knowledge of the language statistics possessed by those who speak the language, and depends on experimental results in prediction of the next letter when the preceding text is known. Results of experiments in prediction are given, and some properties of an ideal predictor are developed."
"The paper describes the recently installed Key West-Havana submarine cable telephone system in which repeaters designed for long life are incorporated in the cable structure and are laid as part of the cable."
"This paper presents a relatively new approach to the solution of negative impedance problems related to vacuum tube circuits. The approach consists of reducing the vacuum tube circuit of a device for producing negative impedance to an electrically equivalent four-terminal network from which the stability and the operation of the device as an element in a system can be predicted accurately. The theory is of interest at this time because a negative impedance repeater, the E1, has recently been developed for use in the exchange plant. It has been found that such a repeater can be placed in series with a voice frequency telephone line to provide transmission gains which are ample for many purposes."
"A new type of telephone receiver is described, in which the permanent magnet, the pole piece and the armature, which drives a light weight dome, are all ring-shaped parts. This structure exhibits a substantially higher grade of performance than present receivers of the bipolar type, with regard to efficiency, frequency range, leakage noise level, and response when held off the ear. In addition to showing the characteristics of this new receiver, an analysis of the various losses is given, and ideal performance limits are established. The advantage of providing an auxiliary path for the air gap flux is indicated, and other applications of the device as a transducer are described."
"The steady state temperature distribution of a relay winding depends upon the power supplied and upon the rates of heat removal at the inner and outer surfaces. This is analyzed in terms of a more general form of the temperature distribution relation discussed by Emmerich (Journal of Applied Physics)1. This analysis is used to determine empirical constants far the rates of heal removal at the surfaces. Illustrative data are given for a stepping magnet."
"THIS is the story of the contributions of inductive loading in the growth of the Bell Telephone System to its present great stature. In particular, it tells how these contributions have been made. We see in it the great economic value of organized research, of research scientists and design and development engineers, of manufacturing skill and care, and of the application of sound engineering principles to the design of the telephone plant."
"A Weiss field calculation has been carried out for antiferromagnetism in more complicated structures than the usual calculation allows and has been shown to give results more detailed and more consistent with experimental evidence on the magnetic properties of such structures than does the simpler theory."
"It was on the 10th of March in 1876, seventy-five years ago, that understandable speech was first sent over a wire. Perhaps the words spoken were not so profoundly important as Mr. Bell might have wished for such an historic occasion, but they were important at the moment. He had spilled some acid and needed Watson's help. More significantly, the words ushered in a new era in communication, an era that as Bell envisioned would see the growth of a vast network of wires connecting people together in their own communities, and connecting the communities to each other. The short span of seventy-five years immediately behind us has seen his great vision more than fulfilled. Progress has been achieved step by step and, although many of the steps were small, their cumulative effect over the past seventy-five years is tremendous. Today, hundreds of millions of people take for granted the ability to converse with almost any one, anywhere."
"SEVENTY-FIVE years ago — on March 10, 1876 — the inventor spoke and his assistant heard the first sentence to be transmitted by telephone: “MR. WATSON, COME HERE; I WANT YOU.” Three days earlier, U.S. Patent No. 174,465 had been granted to Alexander Graham Bell for his concept of means for making the conversion between the air vibrations of an uttered sound and their corresponding electrical undulations."
"A new common battery telephone set has been developed and is now in production which is materially better than previous types in performance and convenience to the user. This paper describes this set, and discusses, as typical of Bell System dleveopment processes, the contributions of the operating, development, and manufacturing organizations to the final design. It also describes the evaluation of the design by the controlled service trial, in terms of the results produced in actual service in the hands of the public."
"AN IDEAL resistor would possess a resistance precisely adjusted to value and constant with time, temperature, voltage and frequency under all conditions of use in the application for which it is intended. Wirewound resistors, which early references to “resistance helices” suggest were the first to be employed, approach the ideal in a number of respects. The advent, however, of applications requiring resistors with high values of resistance, of smaller size, and of greater stability over augmented ranges in operating conditions soon made the realization of the ideal more difficult. Moreover, despite great progress in the development of resistance alloys and in the drawing of fine wires from them, the growth of the communications and electronics industries necessitated the development of resistors smaller and cheaper than can be produced from wire and possessing different characteristics. Non-metallic resistive materials were accordingly introduced, even though some of these possess electrical and mechanical properties which are comparatively less stable. The industries now require resistors having the advantages of the non-metallic types and which at the same time are highly precise and stable. The problem, thus, is that of imparting precision and stability to non-metallic resistive materials or of employing metallic ones in new ways."
"A general method is developed for designing networks with assigned gain or phase characteristics. It is based on the analogy between the gain and phase of linear networks and two-dimensional potential and stream functions, produced by charges corresponding to the network singularities. These analogies exist because the gain and phase functions are the real and imaginary parts of analytic functions of a complex frequency variable. Potential theory is used here to determine charge arrays which correspond to physical network singularities and also yield approximations to assigned potential or stream functions."
"In order to determine the angles of cuts for low temperature coefficient crystals, the elastic constants of quartz have been evaluated in the temperature range from −100°C to +200°C. This has been done by measuring a series of rotated Y-cut crystals in the thickness shear mode and a series of rotated X-cuts in the longitudinal length mode. From the measurements, low temperature coefficients AT, BT, CT, and DT type crystals can be determined which have their temperature of zero temperature coefficient at any prescribed temperature. Calculations are given for the properties of crystals to operate at 200°C. The characteristics of an AT type crystal have been investigated experimentally, and the measured results are in reasonable agreement with the calculations. It is shown that there is a maximum temperature of 190°C for which an AT type crystal can have a zero temperature coefficient."
"Because of a relationship which exists between the properties of a vacuum tube triode and those of a transistor, it is possible to start with a known vacuum tube circuit and to transform it into a completely different circuit suitable for use with transistors. The nature of this transformation is discussed and a number of examples are given."
"The economies which result from sharing the cost of line facilities among a number of channels, and the transmission advantages of carrier circuits (in the form of high speed transmission which minimizes delay and echo effects, low net loss and high quality), have combined to bring about a revolution in long distance telephony. Whereas fifteen years ago only 8% of the toll circuit mileage of the Bell System was furnished by carrier, today carrier circuits comprise about two-thirds of the total mileage. The minimum distance, however, for which carrier can economically replace voice frequency transmission has been limited by the cost of the carrier equipment, the cost of line treatment, the expense of installation and associated job engineering, and the maintenance effort required. As a result, the shorter toll circuits, relatively large in number though not in circuit mileage, have continued to operate at voice frequency. The newly developed Type N-1 Carrier Telephone System is aimed primarily at expanding the application for carrier into this field of short haul service. As explained elsewhere1, it is designed to obtain the advantages of carrier for toll and exchange cable circuits for lengths a small fraction of the previous economic minimum."
"THIS portion of the present review is primarily concerned with non-phantom type of loading on non-repeatered non-quadded cables, since the evolution of exchange area loading has been almost entirely in terms of these facilities."
"The method of effective mass, extended to apply to gradual shifts in energy band s resulting from deformations of th e crystal lattice, is used to estimate the interact ion between electrons of thermal energy and the acoustical modes of vibration. The mobili ties of electrons and holes are thus relat ed to the shifts of the conduct ion and va lence-bond (filled) hands, respectively, associated with dilations of longitudinal waves. The theory is checked by comparison of the sum of the shifts of the conduction and valence-bond bands, as derived from the mobilities, with the shift of the energy gap with dilation. The latter is obtained independently for silicon, germanium and tellurium from one or more of the followin g: (1) the change in intrinsic conductivity with pressure, (2) the change in resistance of an n-p junction with pressure, and (3) the variation of intrinsic concentration with temperature and the thermal expansion coefficient. Higher mobilities of elec trons and holes in germanium as compared with silicon are correlated with a smaller shift of energy gap with dilation."
"The physical quality of motion picture and television images is determined by the transfer characteristic, the standard deviation or signal-to-fluctuation ratio, and the detail flux-response characteristics of the system. The performance of typical systems and system combinations is illustrated by examples permitting numerical comparison. The analysis of fluctuation levels(“noise”) in photographic processes, based on sampling theory, includes an evaluation of the sine-wave frequency spectrum of the deviation as modified by the “aperture” processes of the system. The sine-wave response characteristics of typical apertures are developed as well as an accurate method of determining the equivalent “resolving aperture” (point image) of practical devices from sine-wave response measurements. A new system of rating image-forming devices is thus developed permitting precise evaluation and comparison of components as well as of complete systems including the eye. Part I discusses the transfer characteristics of motion picture and television systems. Parts II and III, to be published at a later date, will contain an analysis of signal-to-fluctuation ratios and detail contrast."
"A brief description is provided for the more important technical activities, including work in progress on composite photography, lighting equipment, wind machines, strippable adhesives, transportation equipment, plastics, diffusion cloths and other items of interest in the production of motion pictures. Mention is also made of the Research Council's function in connection with new products, inventions, television, stereoscopic motion pictures, standards and test films."
"A semiautomatic color analyzer is described for rapidly determining the extent of unbalance, or deviation from “type,” of a processed color negative or color positive monopack film. A standardized light source, a rotating color filter having three sectors which transmit narrow spectral bands of blue, green and red light, a multiplier-type phototube and amplifier, and a cathode-ray tube are employed. The sweep circuit of the cathode-ray tube is synchronized with the rotating filter wheel so that a horizontal straight-line image is produced when a gray or near-gray density of a “balanced” sample is in the light path. A cathode-ray tube image which deviates from a horizontal straight-line image indicates unbalance in a test sample, whereupon correction filters can be introduced in the light path by means of servomechanism devices to produce a horizontal straight-line or “balanced” condition."
"During the past several years the Motion Picture Studio Lighting Committee reports and papers have described studio lighting equipment, set power distribution and power supply.1–6 Some mention has been made of set lighting levels and lamp location but the variables are so great it was found exceedingly difficult to provide the information within the scope of a paper or report. — Because of numerous requests for at least a general picture of set lighting levels and equipment placement, this report will describe and illustrate representative sets which were lighted for three-color photography and come within what may be termed as “high-key” lighting."
"A stereoscope Schlieren system is described. A 16-mm Fastax Camera is used to photograph 10-in. sections of a 4 by 4 in. flame tube at 9000 frames/sec. A polarizing projection system is used. The depth effect is observed with burning gases provided sufficient detail is available in the image."
"Theater television requires picture quality comparable to that attained in feature film releases, and flexibility in program scheduling comparable to television broadcasting. A new 16-mm intermediate film system designed for these requirements is described. The system includes video recording equipment for pickup of coaxial-line or broadcast programs, high-intensity film projection equipment, and an automatic rapid film processor. The use of the rapid film processor is discussed in connection with delay techniques for adequate program scheduling. General operating characteristics are analyzed in terms of economics of the system."
"This paper reviews the uses of television film recording and the possibilities of applying the editing principle to it."
"Images on the retinae of the eyes, resulting when viewing real life subject matter, are not in themselves three-dimensional. The impulses from these images which travel to the brain supply the brain with the data it needs to build the three-dimensional vision which the observer sees in lieu of the subject itself. Present grainless motion picture color film is a nearly perfect medium of establishing synthetic images on the retinae which equal the natural ones. As a result, the data that reaches the brain is comparable to that which might emanate from natural images. The brain, detecting little difference, forms a synthetic vision nearly as perfect as natural vision. — The three-dimensional motion picture camera has been employed with success to capture all of the components of depth perception which are associated with natural vision. In addition high-speed and time-lapse applications have been developed which also incorporate factors of depth perception otherwise impossible to duplicate in natural vision. — A solution of the flicker problem in 16-mm, alternate-frame, stereo projection at 24 frames/sec has been provided through the use of the Morgana shuttle movement. Also the requirement for registration adjustments before or during projection has been eliminated by the use of a barrel-type polarizer which permits projecting through a single-lens axis."
"A new continuous processing machine for wide film carries the principles of motion picture film processing into the field of processing black-and-white film ranging in width from 70 mm to 12 in. Details of design and operation are outlined."
"In mechanics research, evaluation of high-speed motion picture records involves several basic calculations which have to be repeated very often. The Springfield Armory has developed a special slide rule which will mechanically perform these computations, as well as some precalculations before taking the picture. It is believed that the proposed slide rule permits more rapid evaluations with fewer errors and with less highly trained personnel."
"The image phototube is destined to become an important means of taking good quality high-speed photographs. Its worth has already been proved in several fields. It has a much greater light efficiency than the Kerr Cell. A light gain is possible. The angle of view, in contrast to the Kerr Cell, is governed entirely by the lens system used. Relative applications of the device include ultra-high-speed stroboscopes and a versatile color television system. Application of the shutter to very fast multi-frame photography is discussed."
"One of the most important components of good motion picture production as it exists today is the utilization of special effects and their proper planning. To accomplish the purpose of the advertiser, producer or exhibitor, necessary optical stresses must be carefully planned in television or motion picture work. To that end, we have attempted to set forth reasons why certain effects are used in various ways. The following statements should suggest rather than set the rule for what we think is proper according to the experience which the writer has had."
"Several modifications in standard magnetic recording systems which provide greatly improved operating efficiency as well as economies in time and materials are described. These include facilities for: (1) stopping and reversing recorder and projector without losing synchronism, and (2) changing over from Record to Playback, or vice versa, silently, while running. These facilities muke it possible to correct errors in narration and re-recording jobs without need for rethreading, splicing or blooping the film. Also described is a new method for domestic and foreign lip-synchronous production which makes use of 35-mm magnetic loops."
"Synchronous 1/4-in. magnetic tape can be used in various stages of motion picture production. With proper modifications of existing commercial equipment, 1/4-in. tape can be made to do practically everything possible with 35-mm sprocketed magnetic film. Savings in cost and storage space can be more than 90%. This new technique is equally valuable for producing motion pictures for television."
"The camera described has been designed specifically for video recording purposes, and therefore differs in many respects from the usual conception of a 16-mm camera. To accomplish intermittent film pulldown within the short space of time available, a multiple skip claw movement is utilized. The usual mechanical shutter is eliminated, but a device is incorporated to actuate an electronic shutter, which at the same time provides for the transition from 30-frames/sec television to 24-frames/sec film speed. In order to obtain the necessary film stability at the aperture, and to eliminate any tendency to scuff or wear off film emulsion at this point, a vacuum-operated film gate is utilized, which permits the camera to be operated for rather long uninterrupted periods of time. Provision is made within the camera for the simultaneous recording of sound, at standard spacing for correct sound synchronization."
"A screen is described having a gradational perforation pattern in each of the side areas between the central portion and the extreme sides of the screen. The central portion of the screen is uniformly perforated and the extreme side areas are of unperforated screen material. This perforation design tends to compensate for the uneven light intensity from modern carbon-arc lamps, resulting in a practically even light reflection from the surface of the screen. This paper describes a screen which has been designed to have a higher reflectance in the side portions of its surface than in the center, and reasons are presented why this screen is a practical solution to the uneven light distribution problem."
"The results of experiments to determine observer reaction to non-simultaneous presentation of pictures and associated sound are reported. Curves are presented for two groups of observers: (1) a conditioned or technical group, and (2) a group more nearly representative of motion picture or television audiences. The data given may be used to predict observer reaction to the lack of simultancity between picture action and the resulting sound over a range of 0 to 300 milliseconds."
"The requirements of the television medium and the unique design of television cameras have developed, in the best of television cameramen, operators of unusual skill. A broad picture of the abilities and backgrounds of present-day television cameramen is presented, and a general comparison is made between the television cameraman and the motion picture camera operator. The creative role of the cameraman and his relationship to the television director are explained in an outline of the stages of camera rehearsal."
"A new improved unit for the trichromatic measurement and description of illuminants is presented. Described are: methods of derivation; relation to Kelvin color temperature scale; application to color film, filters and light sources; and a three-color instrument for measurement of light sources using this new Spectra Index unit."
"The Rapatronic camera takes still exposures of 2 to 20 μsec with a high degree of resolution. Exposure is easily synchronized with a fast-transient event, and the shutter has at least a 30-deg viewing angle with apertures in the useful range for high-speed photography. The shutter is of the magneto-optic “light valve” type, operating by the rotation of the plane of polarization of light traversing glass in a magnetic field (Faraday effect). Three polarizers, crossed at 0-90-0 deg, produce an open-to-closed transmission ratio in excess of thirty million, and removal of the magnetic field closes the shutter, allowing it to pass only one billionth of the light from the subject."
"Various types of a-c magnetic erase heads of the ring-shaped type are described. After a brief mathematical treatment of the magnetic flux density required for erasing, there are given the measurements of the amount of erasure obtained with various heads used both singly and in cascade. Also included are curves showing the rise in temperature on part of two heads as a function of the 70-kc erase-current through the head."
"Contrary to corresponding developments in the United States and Great Britain our starting point was to employ the magnetic-sound technique in the studio until the final re-recording on sound negative film. We did not take the necessary equipment from the optical recording system, but developed new equipment for magnetic film; and we retained the 6.5-mm magnetic tape for original recordings because of its economy."
"Does everyone head for the corridors when you rise to read your paper? If so, the Secretary of the Physical Society wishes to have a word with you."
"Last summer, Dr. Lozier, as Chairman of the Screen Brightness Committee, initiated a discussion of the scientific basis for establishing screen-brightness values, in order to secure technical advice for the Committee. Prof. O'Brien suggested that a conference be held at Rochester, N.Y., and as a matter of expediency only men available in Rochester were asked to attend. These were men actively engaged in the fields of projection optics and psychology. This report covers the discussion held at Rochester on June 19, 1950."
"The name of this association shall be SOCIETY OF MOTION PICTURE AND TELEVISION ENGINEERS."
"The Subjective Impressions received during the viewing of motion pictures are influenced by a great many factors. What the eye sees on the screen is the result not only of the conditions of the original scene, but also of the many steps of film processing and all the elements involved in the projection of the finished motion picture."
"Data are presented to show not only the effect of the luminance to which the eye is adapted on its ability to discriminate differences in luminance, but also the effect of the visual angle upon this important ocular function. That luminance discrimination depends upon whether the observer's attention is fixed upon a highlight or shadow region is shown by data on threshold luminance when scenes are being viewed in which the luminance varies over a wide range."
"Loci of constant hue are shown for daylight, tungsten light, and green and blue surrounds. Loci of constant saturation are shown for daylight and tungsten-light surrounds. The effects of field size and simultaneous contrast are also shown."
"Subjects, rigorously screened for visual abilities, were tested on a variety of visual perceptual tasks. A brightness range of 0.005 to 6.0 ft-L (at the subject's eye) was used. For each task a critical brightness level (approximately 0.02 to 0.05 ft-L) was found, below which visual performance was impaired (as measured by speed and accuracy scores), and above which increases in brightness produced little or no improvement in visual performance. Implications are discussed."
"The lighting of areas where projected pictures are viewed presents a number of specialized problems to the lighting engineer. However, these specialized problems involve factors of lighting design rather than any particularly unusual visual factors. Basically, projected pictures are visual tasks upon which the eyes and attention of the viewers are concentrated for extended periods. Since the viewing of projected pictures is a seeing task, two distinct objectives are suggested: (1) providing maximal visibility of the task; and (2) providing maximal visual comfort and case of seeing. These are fundamental objectives that must be satisfied in order to obtain optimal seeing conditions in any visual situation. This paper is confined chiefly to the second objective and to those factors which determine whether the area in which projected pictures are viewed is visually satisfactory. The screen is introduced only insofar as it influences or is influenced by the environmental factors."
"The photometric factors in designing the visual environment in a motion picture theater to promote the comfort, enjoyment and safety of the audience are discussed. The dependency relationship of screen surround and house brightnesses to screen brightnesses is explained. Optimum relationships are given and suggestions made for the practical execution of the recommendations, including the locations of lighting units and the shaping of the auditorium walls and ceilings."
"A larger screen, camera angles, factors of psychophysical vision and auditorium viewing are considered relative to the development of more flexible screen cinematography. Screen masking, surround and auditorium environment are also considered."
"A Preliminary survey of 18 theaters by the Screen Brightness Committee in 19471 disclosed interesting indications of theater screen illumination practice in this country, but was inconclusive because the theaters covered represented too limited a sampling. A more extensive survey was not carried out at that time because of the lack of a suitable meter. More recently, the General Electric Company placed at the disposal of the Committee a meter which is better adapted to a theater survey. Consequently, during the summer of 1950, the Screen Brightness Committee of the Society undertook a survey of screen illumination and related factors in 100 representative indoor theaters. It was the Committee's purpose in this larger survey to cover a more representative segment of the theaters in this country and to obtain dependable data concerning their practices, with the underlying thought that observation and discussion of any undesirable conditions would promote better projection. At the present time, results are available on 125 theaters, representing all except the South-east and Pacific sections of the United States. It is believed that these results would not be greatly changed by representative coverage of these additional areas."
"An illuminant which may be of interest to others working in this field has been assembled to give extremely high intensity for small-area use."
"The relation between kinescope luminance and the illuminance on the mosaic of the iconoscope can be measured under operating conditions by the use of specially prepared slides or 16-mm films. One or more small areas in any selected scene are replaced by areas of uniform density. A series of slides or a complete film consists of a series of pictures which are all identical except for the density of these measuring areas. The television chain is adjusted for satisfactory reproduction of the scene. Measurements of the illuminances on the iconoscope in the aforementioned areas are then plotted against measurements of the kinescope luminances in the corresponding areas. — A number of transfer-characteristic curves are shown as examples of the effects of such variables as the density of the picture background, the shading control settings and the illuminance level. The differences between still and intermittent projection are illustrated by a set of transfer curves. Another group of curves shows the transfer characteristic of the photographic process, the transfer characteristic of the televising process, and the transfer characteristic of the combined film-television process. — Because of the dependence of the transfer characteristic upon the nature of the scene, no single characteristic can be considered as representing the performance of an iconoscope film camera chain."
"The quality of pictures televised by an iconoscope film camera is improved by removing the red and infrared portions of the radiation incident upon the mosaic of the iconoscope. The combination of heat-absorbing glass with either an absorption or a reflection type of color filter can be used in the condenser optical system of a 16-mm projector. Such a combination of filters reduces the heat at the film gate enough to permit the film to be held stationary in the gate without damage to the film. The color filters improve picture sharpness, reduce shading requirements, and increase the signal level. The improvement in sharpness is partly an optical effect. The increase in signal level, despite the reduction of photoactive radiation, is believed to be an electronic effect peculiar to the iconoscope principle."
"Outlined are some of the problems of the users of direct-positive subtractive color films, such as Ansco Color and Kodachrome, in producing acceptable duplicate images which in some cases may be third-generation reproductions. An experimental project will be described in which it was found that it is possible to produce duplicate images which may be directly compared with the camera originals by exposing the duplicating film with filters transmitting three relatively narrow spectral bands. While no attempt has been made in this paper to deal in any detail with the theoretical aspects of color reproduction, a number of factors which are of great concern to the users of color materials have been noted — particularly the establishment of visual acceptance limits for color images, and the influence of processing upon the shape and relationship of the three-color density curves representing an image of a neutral wedge."
"Among the organizations in which our Society maintains official representation is the United States National Committee of the International Commission on Illumination."
"Discussed is the use of a high-speed camera as a tool in the Company's Engineering Division. Motion of fast moving parts is easily plotted by the use of a special timing disc graduated to 0.001 sec. Through the use of negative film, film can be processed for study within two hours."
"At the present time, both iconoscopes and image orthicons are employed in monochrome television broadcasting for transmission of motion picture film. The theoretical considerations of such operation have been covered quite thoroughly in the literature, while the many practical problems have received very little attention. A discussion of the correlation between the basic theoretical problems of television motion picture film pickup and their practical solutions as presently employed in television broadcasting is given."
"An acceptable training film can be rapidly produced by utilizing television cameras and a video recorder to combine shooting and editing. High equipment costs and relative immobility of equipment limit application to large-scale producers except in cases where speed of production is of paramount importance."
"This paper examines the techniques now current and estimates the possibilities of accomplishing the production of truly electronic motion pictures of sufficient technical quality to reproject into the television broadcast channels."
"The problems and methods of handling television film commercial and short productions economically and in a limited space are outlined."
"The meter described in this article will measure the total lumens output of the projector and, by means of aperture plates, the light distribution over the screen. These measurements are taken by holding the meter directly in front of the projection lens. The “off” projector can be checked and adjusted just prior to use."
"It was decided that a new film processing machine at Du Art Film Laboratories, Inc., should be capable of handling either 16-mm or 35-mm film. After a number of experiments to find the best sprocket and spool combination, a radically new type of spool distinguished by a tapered profile was chosen. The advantages of this design, as applied to sprocket-drive and friction-drive machines, are enumerated."
"Motion picture technology is predominantly focused on photographic and other processes for recording action and sound. Few papers1 have been contributed dealing with other technical activities pursued with commensurate skill, inventiveness and constantly expanding knowledge of materials and processes in Hollywood studios. Set construction and special effects present an amazing variety of problems little known or even suspected by outsiders as concerning motion picture production. This paper attempts a description of materials and techniques applying to set construction and special effects. Emphasis is placed on pointing out present technology, desirable improvements and possible developing trends."
"By simultaneous application of signal frequencies, d-c noise reduction bias and “supersonic” a-c bias to a variable-density light valve, it is possible to make direct recordings or electrical prints on Kodachrome with very low inter-modulation distortion. This technique permits the use of a higher transmission with a resulting increase in sound output of at least 6 db."
"Absolute speed control can be achieved only with a fixed or recorded reference. Reasons include physical properties of tape and mechanical properties of tape transport. If tape properties can be accepted as they exist, the mechanical theories of tape transport must be thoroughly investigated. This paper is a resume of the pertinent and sometimes little understood phenomena of tape transport and a report of the limits which these theories have achieved in practice."
"Over a Period of Years the motion picture industry has developed lighting techniques which suit their modes of operation and, similarly, the techniques of the commercial. still photographer have evolved to meet his requirements. It is not unreasonable therefore that the television industry, having borrowed some techniques from both groups, has gone on to develop additional methods to meet its peculiar needs."
"The methods of sensitometry of color materials and processes are specialized developments of the methods of black-and-white sensitometry. The nature of the individual material and its intended use govern the specifications of the operations of exposing, processing, density measurement, and interpretation of results. Apparatus and techniques now available are adequate for important applications of sensitometry in the manufacture and use of color materials. Current research is refining existing methods of sensitometric investigation and yielding more significant test results."
"The definition of equivalent density of a primary color of a multilayer color film is given and a direct-reading photoelectric equivalent densitometer is described. The method of operation of the instrument is explained and the basic features of the electronic circuit and the optical and mechanical layouts are given. The apparatus has made it possible to make direct measurements of the density of any one primary color of a color film without being affected by the presence, if any, of other primaries."
"A new densitometer for the analysis of color films reads densities with a narrow wavelength band at any desired wavelength between 350 and 760 mμ. This instrument was constructed utilizing two commercially available units: a Coleman Model 10-S Double Monochromator Spectrophotometer and a Western Electric RA-1100-B Densitometer. It has performed quite satisfactorily during more than two years of continuous service."
"The adoption of safety base film throughout the motion picture industry has required the abandonment of the Bell & Howell perforation for color release prints. This fact presents an opportunity to achieve the long-desired goal of a single standard perforation for negative and positive films in all applications. Tests are described and conclusions reached covering registration problems in the studio, studio laboratory and release laboratory, as well as accelerated and normal release life tests on Dubray-Howell perforated black-and-white prints."
"The advent of television has accelerated the need for refinements and improvements in the art of the projected motion picture in theaters. The factors of cinematography, theater location, seating capacity and theater design have to be dealt with in accordance with circumstances which already appear to call for a fresh approach to the problem. It is important to evaluate the ability to adapt existing theaters to the new requirements."
"This paper reviews and compares the quantitative meaning of the term resolution as commonly used by the television industry and the film industry. The danger of using values of limiting resolution as the sole measure of picture quality is discussed. Conversion equations are developed and tables listing numerically equivalent values of resolution are provided."
"In this country the iconoscope is used almost universally for motion picture film camera chains. In Europe the flying-spot scanner has recently come into extensive use. Other pickup devices, storage and nonstorage, such as the image orthicon, image iconoscope and image dissector tube, have been used experimentally or in a limited commercial way. The characteristics of each of these tubes and their associated equipment are discussed, and certain advantages are evaluated with respect to such factors as signal-to-noise ratio, spurious signals, spectral response and transfer characteristic."
"Discussed are methods of manufacturing glass television bulbs, together with engineering data on mechanical, dimensional, optical and electrical characteristics of bulbs and glass. Current trends are given for size, shape and deflection angle."
"The SMPTE Subcommittee on Lens Calibration has formally recognized, through incorporation in its report, two methods of lens calibration. While they reach equivalent results and will calibrate lenses identically when properly safeguarded, each has its own short comings and advantages, which are not commonly recognized. To dispel the evident misunderstandings about these two methods, they are compared and the reasons are indicated for the method chosen. New equipment designed by Bausch & Lomb Optical Co. for lens calibration based on the diffuse method is described briefly."
"There is a growing recognition of the fact that to obtain constant screen color and light intensity, the position of the positive carbon must be maintained automatically in relation to the projection lamphouse optical system. In the development and application of such a control feature, the requirements of carbon-feed systems have been reviewed. The differential carbon-feed system seems to meet these requirements, and considerations pertaining to the application of the differential feed system with automatic positioning to an angular trim burner will be related."
"This bibliography was compiled by Miss Elsie Garvin, Librarian, Research Library, Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, N.Y., and was recommended for publication in the Journal by the Society's High-Speed Photography Committee. Those who reviewed the 600 items suggested that they be arranged by subject and that certain entries be expanded by annotation. John H. Waddell, Chairman of the Committee, undertook the job of classification; many more items were added, dating up to July, 1950; and manuscript was released on December 7, 1950, for publication."
"THE PROPOSED American Standard for Winding of 16-mm Sound Film, was published as a first draft in the September, 1949, JOURNAL. While that was the first time that winding 16-mm sound film had been proposed for adoption as an American Standard, the proposals were practices already followed by the film manufacturers for a number of years. It should also be noted that, in 1941, the Society recognized the method of designating the two types of windings by publishing a Society recommendation, and that recommendation was substantially repeated in the first draft for this proposed standard."
"THE TENTATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS included herewith are the result of extensive work carried on by a Subcommittee of the 16- and 8-mm Committee under the Chairmanship of E. W. D'Arcy. It should be clearly understood that this is not a final Society recommendation, but rather that it is an interim report of the committee. The proposal is being published at this stage to make the information available to those who have use for it and to invite additional comments and discussion."
"Provisional evaluation of permissible random noise for theater television is considered from several sources of information. These cover broadcast television experience and the graininess in motion picture film; the requirements deduced from the various sources generally agree. For broadcast television, a frequency weighting and limit on weighted noise power have been used. The finer picture detail of theater television presumes a lower permissible random noise. Changes in weighting curve are discussed. A limit figure of noise is suggested, which is comparable to graininess effects in motion pictures, though slightly more severe than present published performance on camera tubes."
"The existence of two or more perforation shapes for 35-mm films has, for many years, been considered undesirable. For processes requiring accurate film positioning, the dual Standard of Negative perforation for camera stock and Positive perforation for release stock does not suffice. Registration problems are minimized if Negative perforations are used throughout; experience, however, has shown that projection life is short. The Modified Negative perforation, with fillets at the corners, has improved resistance to tear while preserving the general negative form corresponding to conventional piloting means. Tests conducted show that better film positioning is accomplished in conventional camera and printing equipment for film with Modified Negative perforations than for film with Dubray-Howell perforations. The method of evaluating film location during exposure and printing is described and evidence of results presented. Photoelectrically recorded charts show the extent of out-of-register which resulted for various combinations of perforation types. Film-life projection tests indicate that the Modified Negative perforation is equal or superior to the Dubray-Howell perforation."
"Comparative data on the steadiness of motion picture film images are generally obtained by recording the qualitative observations of viewers. Recent problems encountered in evaluating the relative merits of several types of perforations, each of which was being considered as a universal 35-mm standard, necessitated the development of a method for obtaining specific quantitative steadiness data. An instrument which utilizes variable-area photoelectric recording techniques was devised to measure, indicate and record steadiness data of the motion picture image relative to the screen and/or perforation. Use of this instrument and a special test screen permits viewing of a projected motion picture test film while simultaneously measuring the image steadiness and recording the data measured."
"The photographic image in the sound-track area of Eastman Color Print Film, Type 5381, is composed of metallic silver plus dye. The normal sensitometric specifications for sound negatives used in release printing on black-and-white materials are also suitable for negatives to be printed on Type 5381. The sound track should be printed by light which has been filtered in such a manner that the dye component of the developed image will be neutral. In general, the sound quality of neutral prints on Type 5381 is comparable with that of prints on Eastman Fine Grain Release Positive Film, Type 5302, but the latter has superior response at the higher frequencies."
"In order to correlate photographs with other recorded data, the optical system of a galvanometer oscillograph was modified so that it could record on the film in the exposure aperture of a 16-mm Fastax camera. The addition of the galvanometer system required no permanent alterations of the Fastax camera and provided a record in the form of a spot which moved horizontally in the field of view when the film was projected."
"This Forum was sponsored by the SMPE Atlantic Coast Section and the Acoustical Society of America, and was held on June 7, 1949, at New York, William H. Rivers presiding, and Professor Leo L. Beranek acting as Moderator."
"Experience in installing large numbers of a standard sound-film equipment in theaters indicated that sound quality was not related to the overall frequency characteristic or the reverberation time. A pulse technique is described which gives a direct picture of the direct and reverberant sound at any location. The value of the reverberation-time concept as presently defined is questioned and recommendations for the optimum design of theaters are given, based on the results of pulse analysis."
"In the Scandinavian countries no fundamental or systematic research on acoustics in movie theaters has been done, as far as I know, and, as a non-authority in the field, I am able to give only a brief informal report of some facts about our theaters and what I think is the general opinion on theater design at the moment in Scandinavia."
"Dr. Beranek: To start the discussion, I will call on those at the table, starting at the end:"
"A survey has been made of the width, variation in width, and shrinkage of 16-mm film in a number of exchanges. These data are of use to designers of 16-mm equipment in describing the dimensions of film currently being used, and to purchasers of film in giving them some idea of the steadiness characteristics the film might possess."
"Although metol behaves as a very weak base in aqueous solutions, it acts as a strong base in glacial acetic acid and can be titrated with glacial acetic acid solutions of perchloric and sulfuric acids, using an indicator. The end point is much sharper with perchloric acid than with sulfuric acid as shown by potentiometric titration curves of the two acids. Procedures and results are described for the analysis of several types of developer solutions employing glacial acetic acid solutions for the metol determination and ceric sulfate for the determination of hydroquinone."
"Presented here are results of tests to determine how much video crosstalk can be tolerated in black-and-white television pictures. Experienced observers viewed a television picture and rated the disturbing effects of controlled amounts of crosstalk from another video system. Crosstalk coupling was simulated by a network which permitted changes in frequency characteristic as well as in coupling loss. Tolerable limits for crosstalk coupling are derived from the test results."
"The general properties of a reflective optical system of the Schmidt type are discussed, with particular reference to practical considerations of design and application in the theater. The relationships of focal length, projection distance and incident screen illumination are illustrated. Also discussed are the factors on which resolving power and fine-detail contrast depend. Some facts relating to the design, material and application of the aspheric or ogee lens are given."
"To reduce the cost and improve the efficiency of motion picture production, the Independent Frame technique, sponsored by the J. Arthur Rank Organization of Great Britain, aims at a flow system of production. This method, which has had marked success in a series of experimental films, now is being developed for use with television cameras and for remote direction and editing."
"THE PURPOSE of this paper is to define the field of photographic instrumentation and to report, briefly on the progress that was attained in that field during 1950."
"THE RESULTS of a survey by the Screen Brightness Committee in 125 indoor theaters and 18 West Coast studio 35-mm review rooms have recently been presented in this JOURNAL.1 These included data on theater seating capacity, screen width, screen brightness, side and corner distribution and screen reflectivity."
"Theater television offers tremendous possibilities to the motion picture industry as a new form of entertainment, but requires picture quality which measures up to the high standards of 35-mm motion picture practice. A totally new system is proposed which can produce the required picture quality. It differs from the home television system in several important respects, such as a higher number of scanning lines, a lower frame frequency, and greater video bandwidth. New electronic bandwidth-compression techniques may enable transmission of the improved picture over presently available relay facilities. Detailed discussion of the new standards and techniques points out advantages and possible disadvantages of this approach."
"The evaluation of quality of color reproduction poses many complex problems. Optimum reproduction needs to be identified. Since it depends upon the limitations of the reproduction process, as well as upon human vision and judgment, optimum reproduction will probably have to be determined for each process separately. The program is to vary the production controls in systematic manners, measure the resulting color reproduction in the best way known (e.g., the ICI method at the present time), submit the reproductions to visual judgment, and study the judgment data in comparison with the measurements in order to find significant correlations. The growing experience of such studies of color photography is suggested as a guide. Preliminary estimates of optimum reproduction and of seriousness of deviations may be based tentatively on results of studies of noticeability of color differences and on fragmentary results of studies of color photography. These estimates can be improved as various parts of the program are carried out."
"In this paper an attempt has been made to evaluate a method of motion study pertaining to moving machinery. The test object was a 13-ton capacity punch press and the motion study was performed with a high-speed motion picture camera. It is shown that the motion picture camera produces: (1) a visual indication of the actual occurrence which allows an understanding that nonvisual means could not afford; (2) a method of study which does not influence the system studied in the least; and (3) a record of the occurrence which has very little inherent error."
"In the first part of the study, the maintenance costs of 192 prints of sound motion picture films in active circulation between 1942 and 1950 are analyzed. In the second part, an attempt is made to analyze the damages to motion pictures distributed during the course of one year of operation. Circulation figures and percentages for each month of the year are compared with the amount and percentages of damages occurring during the same period."
"A fully integrated sound system designed to meet the needs of regular and drive-in theaters, having power requirements ranging from 20 to 280 watts, features standardized chassis and cabinet design, interchangeable power amplifiers and a plug-in preamplifier located in the soundhead. Use of modern circuit techniques and conservative rating of all components afford reliability and rated performance under all conditions."
"A heat-absorbing filter is of primary importance for cooling film or slides, and experimental results are given of the performance of various types. A good filter, combined with a more powerful lamp, allows the screen illumination to be doubled without affecting the film. A study of the heat flow within the film during exposure leads to estimates of the efficacy of methods of film cooling which may be used in the future. The theory of cooling slides shows that best results are given by blowing air at very high velocities across the slide, to remove the “blanket” of stagnant air adhering to the surfaces. A practical slide cooler is described, and its performance figures given."
"This paper describes the unique features of the Acme Process Camera and their applications to special effects photography. Basic camera-design features include a color wheel for three-color successive-frame photography, interchangeable film movements with various locations of the register pins, a reflex viewer, embodying register pins in optical alignment with those of the film movement, projection facilities for “matte painting” which allow processed stock to be located on the register pins of the viewer and the image projected through the photographic objective. The electrical and mechanical operation of two new types of drive motors, the Acme stop-motion motor and the variable-speed synchronous motor, and their use in conjunction with the camera are also discussed."
"A new all-purpose film leader design, commonly called “The Society Leader,” is described, its history given and its development, tests and uses to date are discussed. A proposal is made for its further application to motion picture prints of all types and for all services."
"The processing of motion picture positive film by high-temperature developers and fixing solutions, and subsequent drying by turbulent air, results in film quality which is superior in some respects to film processed by conventional laboratory methods. Positive pictures, printed from an original camera negative, were processed by conventional techniques and by high-temperature methods."
"The problem of rapid processing of motion picture film has received considerable attention in the last decade. Although considerable study has been made of various methods to increase the speed of developing, fixing and washing, relatively little effort has been expended to improve the speed of drying. A description is herewith given of a number of different equipments which were designed after a theoretical investigation had been made of the drying problem. These equipments permit the ultrarapid drying of motion picture film in a convenient manner with extremely low distortion. One application of these units has been incorporated in the Paramount Theater-Television Units for the rapid processing of 35-mm film."
"The functions of a video transmission system in a local exchange area in providing mobility for the pickup camera and interconnection with the intercity networks are discussed; and an analysis of some of the television transmission problems is presented. A description is given of the physical and electrical characteristics of the various types of cable facilities, the video amplifiers, and equalizers now employed; and an example of the television transmission performance obtained is included."
"This paper describes a portable magnetic-recording system for producing high-quality sound track in synchronism with pictures. The system has been designed to enable magnetic recording to conform with standard motion picture studio operating practices. A number of features such as high-speed rewind, interlocked-switching facilities, one basic type of amplifier and the use of miniature tubes throughout have been incorporated in the system."
"In a carbon are motion picture projector, definite relations exist between screen light on the one hand, and the are current, current density, carbon size and the speed and collection angle of the projector optical system on the other. Measurements on more than 100 standard and experimental carbon arcs, with carbons ranging in size from 9 mm to 16 mm, have provided data to establish these relationships. Conditions are defined which are of importance in the matching of an optical system to a given are, or vice versa, and for obtaining optimum performance in any situation involving screen distribution, amount of light and preferred current."
"The design of the first commercial theater television equipment is based on the experience gained from installing and operating earlier developmental equipments in theaters. Designed to augment the standard theater sound equipment, the PT-100 Television Equipment is intended to combine maximum reliability with performance limited only by the quality of the incoming signal."
"The paper describes the design and development of the 7NP4, a 7-in., 80-kv kinescope which is capable of providing clear, bright, theater-size (15 × 20 ft) television pictures. The development involved solving design problems including: (1) a high-efficiency, low-color-shift, white fluorescent screen; (2) adequate high-voltage insulation; and (3) a gun to provide electrostatic focus of a high-current beam into a small, sharp spot, and magnetic deflection through a relatively narrow angle to conserve deflection power and provide essentially uniform focus over the entire picture area."
"Recent initial installations of the RCA PT-100 Theater Television System are described. Problems encountered in these installations and their practical solution are discussed. Now that the first commercial Theater Television Systems have been installed in a number of representative theaters, the experience acquired at these installations will be valuable in reducing the installation of theater television equipment to a routine procedure, comparable to the installation of sound motion picture equipment. Procedures followed in making these initial installations are described, beginning with the preliminary theater survey to the final installation check and adjustment before projecting a picture on the screen, including service and maintenance problems."
"The reproduction of filmed material over the television system seldom approaches the quality of direct projection. The degradation in quality is usually apparent as loss of detail, compression in both the highlights and the shadows, increased fluctuation noise and the introduction of spurious signals in the form of shading, edge flare, spots and halo. Loss of detail and distortion of the contrast rendition can be reduced by the employment of electrical compensation. Such methods have been employed with varying degrees of success. The extent to which they can be used is limited by the aggravation of noise and spurious signals. Conventional photographic processes do not permit an increase in detail to be achieved while attempts to minimize the compression of the highlights and shadows by reducing the range of the positive transparency to be televised are accompanied by loss of resolution due to the lowered contrast in the fine detail."
"In 1949, the Eastman Kodak Company agreed to license independent laboratories to process 16-mm Kodachrome film. The first machine for this purpose has been built by The Calvin Company, and has been in use since April 1, 1950. This paper gives a description of the machine, some of the problems encountered with the process, and some of the results obtained."
"In variable-area recordings made for direct-playback purposes, the density of the “opaque” part of the track is established by distortion criteria and is usually so low that the signal-to-noise ratio is adversely affected. A system of “double noise reduction” is proposed which does not require the use of auxiliary lamps, slits or galvanometers. By this means, not only is the clear area of the track reduced during periods of low modulation, but also the density of the exposed area of the track outside the modulation envelope is increased in order to reduce the noise contributed by this part of the track. Tests indicate that a reduction in noise of 3 to 4 db can be expected."
"The analysis of film drives may require the knowledge of the compliance of looped film, defined as the rate by which the length of looped film changes with changing film pull. In some mechanical filters for the suppression of film flutter the compliance of film loops acts in analogy to the capacitance of electrical filters. However, it is known to be highly nonlinear. As no complete information has been published on this subject, theoretical relations are derived in such form that they can be conveniently applied by the designer to U-shaped and S-shaped film loops. The results are compared with an earlier published approximation. The effect of film curling is shown to be accountable in a simple manner."
"The biological principles of auditory localization as related to stereosound reproduction are discussed. The human head carries two laterally-attached, biological sound receivers and the conduction of sound within these receivers, their position and the role of the skull in the sound field are also discussed. The attributes of the acoustic signal relevant to sound localization and the role of the central nervous system in the integration of binaural auditory stimulation are described. The factors of experience and training are stressed."
"This paper is divided into four sections. The first deals with the actual standards as established by the Federal Communications Commission and discusses their colorimetric significance. Section II discusses the design and performance of typical commercial color-television receivers. Section III will be of special interest to the broadcaster as it describes the conversion of existing black-and-white studio equipment for color-television use. Some data on studio installation and lighting are also supplied. Section IV deals with nonbroadcast uses of color television and describes industrial color-television equipment known as Vericolor."
"In conjunction with the CBS color television system a method has been developed for improving the apparent picture definition, called “crispening.” It uses nonlinear circuitry to decrease the apparent rise time of an isolated step input which is applied to a bandwidth limited system. This gives the color television pictures (with the exception of repetitive patterns representing frequencies beyond system cutoff) the appearance of having been transmitted through a system of greater bandwidth. The basic idea is to add to a waveform with a slow transition a second waveform, representing the difference between the desired waveform and the original waveform. — A simple circuit is described which utilizes nonlinear means for reforming the roughly triangular differential of the step signal into a narrower “spike” roughly triangular in shape which is superimposed on the original waveform to obtain a response corresponding to about half the original rise time. Various crispening circuits have been designed for specific applications and will be discussed in more detail."
"A description is presented of various methods of producing a stereoscopic pair of motion pictures by photographing subject matter which in itself is two-dimensional and by using only standard monocular animation and optical equipment."
"The day is coming when television will be a basic distribution medium for the motion picture industry. Equipment requirements for this purpose may well be different and more exacting than those currently accepted for television broadcasting. A review of the present state of the art, from a description of modern television equipment and consideration of some of the factors involved in adapting television for motion picture use, enables one to make an “educated guess” as to the potential needs of Hollywood in the light of what is now possible."
"A unique sprocket tooth whose driving face is a plane lying on a radius of the sprocket is used to improve longitudinal registration of the film over that obtained with conventionally shaped, curved-profile teeth. By supporting the film or films by means of an appropriately decentered drum while the films are in engagement with this sprocket, shrinkage accommodation is effected by virtue of the varying effective pitch of the sprocket. The variable-pitch effect also makes it possible to strip the film off the sprocket. — Calculated and measured flutter in sound prints and measured steadiness in picture prints made on a sprocket of this type in a 16-mm continuous contact printer are found to be substantially independent of film shrinkage and to be markedly better than in prints made on conventional printers."
"A description is given of the technical characteristics of carbon-arc lamps which make them outstanding for motion picture studio lighting. These include penetrating power, covering power, shadow sharpness and spectral properties of the radiation. These are considered in relation to the requirements of various types and sensitivities of color film."
"A small head for magnetic recording and reproduction has been developed to fit within the area of the sound drum of a standard RCA-400, 16-mm projector. The head mounting is such that the projector can be used for the two magnetic functions as well as photographic reproduction. The amplifier modifications included increasing the amplifier gain, using various compensating circuits, decreasing the oscillator distortion and means for eliminating the possibility of leaving the record-playback head in a magnetized state. Two switches, mechanically coupled, have been provided to permit the selection of the desired amplifier function."
"A new type of electric cine-interval industrial and research recording camera, designed to produce a compact and reliable remotely controlled unit, is described. Requirements of one of the more difficult types of photographic recording, that of test aircraft instruments, are discussed. The application and results of electromagnetic clutch, as used to operate the Automax Recording Camera as both a motion picture and a still camera, are described."
"With the increased use of photographic recorders for military aircraft flight testing, there has been a need for an efficient film reading device to enable rapid evaluation of the recorded data. This paper not only introduces a projector-reader that meets this demand, but also suggests that, with certain modifications, it will be of use to the following: 1. draftsman or engineer, 2. film editor, 3. animator, and 4. rush film reviewer."
"MINOR REVISIONS of two American Standards, PH22.15–1946 and PH22.16–1947 (“Emulsion and Sound Record Positions in Camera for 16-mm Sound Motion Picture Film” and “Emulsion and Sound Record Positions in Projector for Direct Front Projection of 16-mm Sound Motion Picture Film”) were proposed by the Standards Committee in January 1951 and published for trial and comment in the May 1951 Journal."
"AT' THE SOCIETY'S 70th Semiannual Convention a new public address-recording system was used for the first time. This equipment had been engineered and assembled over the past six months by the Eastern Public Address and Recording Committee under the Chairmanship of Harry Braun and was assembled and tested at Society headquarters by Fred Whitney."
"The following report has been recast in the past tense for Journal reading, compared with the form in which it was presented on October 13, 1951, to the Society's Board of Governors."
"This standard applies to all air circuit breakers with interrupting rating over 10,000 amperes as follows: A. Air circuit breakers 1500 volts or less alternating current and 3000 volts or less direct current. Special purpose air circuit breakers for the control of generators, rectifiers and for heavy duty applications, in addition to meeting these standards generally have other requirements not yet standardized. B. All field discharge breakers comprising air circuit breaker contact elements with field discharge contacts added, of any ampere rating single pole or multipole. C. Air circuit breakers assembled as integral units in supporting and enclosing housings of insulation material for voltage ratings up to and including 600 volts alternating current, 250 volts direct current. D. Air circuit breakers, when in individual enclosures usually built of steel for separate mounting."
"These Marine Recommendations have been drawn up to serve as a guide for the equipment of merchant vessels with an electric plant system and electric apparatus for lighting, signaling, communication, power, and propulsion. They indicate what is considered good engineering practice with reference to safety of the personnel and of the ship itself as well as reliability and durability of the apparatus ; it is not intended, however, that improvements, which may be developed from time to time, should be excluded. These Recommendations are intended to supplement the other Standards of the AIEE, which should be followed wherever applicable. Attention is directed to the fact that regulations for electric installations on shipboard are promulgated by the Government Regulatory Agencies and the American Bureau of Shipping. These Recommendations have given due consideration to all the regulations, but since the above referenced sponsoring bodies are frequently modifying the requirements to meet changing conditions, reference should always be made to the latest edition of their requirements."
"Presents the title page to the paper presented at this conference."
"Presents the table of contents from this conference."
"In compiling the fifteenth volume of the “Digest of Literature on Dielectrics”, the same criteria which have governed the selection of references in previous years have been applied again."
"The subject of Dielectrics covers a very considerable variety of problems reflecting the merging interests of pure scientists and practical engineers. This is exemplified in the following summary, which lists some of the achievements in this field in 1951."
"The method of the correlation parameter of Kirkwood has been applied to the derivation of the local field in liquids1. Onsager's formula for the dielectric constant was obtained on the basis of a point dipole model superimposed on a rigid molecular sphere assuming a uniform radial distribution outside the sphere. Alternatively, on assuming a lattice structure, Van Vleck's formula was derived."
"The fundamental electrical standards for the United States are maintained by the National Bureau of Standards. Silsbee1 describes briefly the d.c. and low frequency standards of resistance, inductance and capacitance. The radio-frequency standards and methods of measurement are described in a separate technical bulletin2. Laverick3 surveys the entire field of dielectric measurements, with special reference to the use of pulsed, instead of sinusoidal, voltages. By this means an equivalent circuit for the dielectric under investigation is established, which will hold over a limited frequency range."
"The only theoretical paper, one of considerable interest to the field, contains Heller's calculation of the electric strength of a non-polar crystal1. The calculation is based on a view of the breakdown process which differs in several important ways from those of von Hippel, Fröhlich, Seitz, and Callen based on the avalanche criterion."
"Following the precedent set in the 1950 Digest, Literature on luminescent materials is covered in this chapter."
"During the year 1951 interest in barium titanate dielectrics remained high. There was also considerable work done on the properties of other ferro-electric materials such as certain zirconates, niobates and tungstic oxide."
"In an article by Stepichev1 the chemical analysis and microstructure of crystalline corundum insulator materials are discussed."
"This digest comprises mineral insulating oils, Askarels and other synthetic insulating liquids."
"This chapter summarizes the literature on insulating films for 1951. It includes references on paper, textile and plastic insulation in the form of thin sheets. The abstract coverage embraces a wider range of subjects than in previous years and for this reason some duplication with abstracts appearing in other chapters may be noted."
"The coverage of the literature on plastics in this review is not confined to publications dealing solely with electrical properties and electrical applications. In order to keep the length of this chapter within reasonable limits, an attempt has been made to omit references to articles of a general nature; to those that might be considered to deal with subjects of common knowledge; and to those of a purely advertising or publicity character that fail to identify products or processes in even a general way. References to purely chemical literature presumed to be of secondary interest to the users of plastics have been limited as much as possible. As in the past, no attempt to cover patent literature as such has been made, since patents are adequately covered elsewhere. Regrettably, the coverage of plastics literature in foreign languages is very limited. Because of the enormous volume of the literature relating to plastics, it is not unlikely that a number of important contributions may have been unintentionally overlooked in the preparation of this digest."
"Presents the author index from the conference."
"It is characteristic of the present state of the science of insulating materials that the scope of any bibliography of rubber insulation should be somewhate ambiguous. Insulation containing Hevea is certainly rubber. Likewise nobody would take acception to placing GR-S, butyl, or any of the other “synthetic rubbers” in the same category. If butyl is a rubber, what of its blends with polyethylene? If they are rubber, is pure polyethylene also rubber? Where in this picture do we place plasticized polyvinyl chloride which is replacing rubber in many applications? If the meaning of rubber is narrowly construed then there have been relatively few new developments in this field during 1951. If it is broadly construed then developments are numerous."
"It has been common practice for a long time in this country to ground the secondary circuits and cases of most instrument transformers used in switching stations, substations and generating stations and in certain other types of installations for reasons of safety to personnel and equipment. The object of the grounding is to limit the voltage on the secondary circuits and cases due to the effects of (1) possible insulation failure or other accidental contact between the primary circuit and the secondary circuit and/or case, which can subject them to full primary voltage, and (2) the capacitive coupling! between the primary and secondary circuit and case, which may impart to the secondary circuit and/or case objectionable or dangerous voltages to ground. However, there has been no general agreement among manufacturers and users whether all such instrument transformers, including auxiliary transformers, irrespective of voltage, should be grounded or just how this grounding should be done. The object of this Guide, based to a large extent on the findings and conclusions contained in a report by the AIEE Relay Committee titled Grounding of Instrument Transformer Secondary Circuits'' published in the April 1947 issue of Electrical Engineering, is to give recommendations in this respect.This Guide contains general and specific recommendations for grounding of the secondary circuits and cases of instrument, i.e., potential and current, transformers in all types of installations. These recommendations apply to all instrument transformers irre-spective of the value of primary voltage or whether the primary windings of the transformers are connected to, or in, power circuits or whether these primary windings are connected in the secondary circuits of other instrument transformers. Exceptions to grounding are permissible where the advantages obtained by not grounding in certain instances or in certain types of installations are considered to outweigh the safety or other advantages obtained by grounding. However, such exceptions should be made only (1) when the instrument transformers form part of a separate metering or network installation and not part of a switching station, substation or generating station, and (2) when the primary windings are connected to circuits of 600 volts or less. Furthermore, for reasons of increased safety in those metering or network installations where the instrument transformers or live parts of the secondary circuit are accessible to other than authorized personnel, (1) the exceptions to the grounding of the secondary circuits should be made only if the voltage of the primary circuit is 300 volts or less to ground and (2) the exceptions to the grounding of the cases should be made only if the voltage of the primary circuit is 150 volts or less to ground."

"From the general interest shown in high temperature materials and the inconclusive state of the art, it is the feeling of several spokesmen that non-partisan conferences should be held oftener than annually. The value of having, all prime manufacturers present was amply demonstrated, because of divergent viewpoints on ostensibly similar materials."
"It bas been customary until very recently to report measurements of volume resistivity high quality insulating materials as greater than some figure such as 1015 ohm-cm. This was partially due to the lack of proper instruments for measuring the high values characteristic of the better insulating materials such as polystyrene, teflon and polyethylene, but primarily due to the fact that few insulator applications existed until recently which required extremely low direct current leakage. The work with which this paper is concerned was initiated by the Signal Corps Engineering Laboratories as a result of difficulties encountered in various instruments used for measuring high energy radiation such as, for example, the ionization chamber type consisting essentially of a charged capacitor whose charge is neutralized to a measurable extent by ionizing radiation. It is apparent that leakage in supporting insulators which is not constant and low under all operational conditions will cause errors in the measurements."
"The purpose of this study was to provide certain quantitative information on the, corrosion of metals in insulating oils, and simultaneously to throw more light on the anions present in hydrocarbons. The process under study was the deposition of metal salts on a metal surface in contact with oil containing an aliphatic acid in solution. The metals that gave positive effects were copper, lead, and zinc. The aliphatic acid was carbon 14 labeled, and the small amounts deposited were determined by measurement of radioactivity of the metal, samples. The deposition was effected in one group of experiments by chemical action and in another group by electrochemical action."
"The design philosophy first proposed by Hartshorn and Ward has been adopted for a dielectric sample, holder, but with several important refinements. In particular, the holder described is designed to be extremely adaptable for use with many types of measuring equipment, and at low frequencies as well as high."
"Ideas and organizations wear out if not reappraised at appropriate time intervals and adapted to changing circumstances. For our Conference the situation has changed completely since it was first launched after World War I. Inspired by Professor Whitehead's enthusiasm, a small band of insulation experts first met in an annual Round Table conference. Anyone contributing a paper was a member for that year, and nobody paid dues, since Dr. Davidson generously dedicated energy and office help to keep the written record straight."
"Two recent foreign publications have openly drawn attention to a type or, rather, class of failures which may beset electrical insulation, particularly wire and cable insulation: electro-endosmosis. Such failures are possible, and possible only, if the circuits operate on direct current, with the conductor at negative potential, and if the circuits are installed in moist locations. As usual, increased temperature accelerates the rate of deterioration but what other factors contribute to, or counteract, failure development is still fairly obscure. Most of the work has centered around polyvinyl-chloride compounds, and there seems to be little doubt that fatty acid ester plasticizers, and traces of emulsifiers, lower the resistance to endosmosis. On the other hand, polyvinyl-chloride compounds, as well as other insulations which are, for all practical operating conditions, immune to endosmosis, do exist."
"Industrial and utility engineers are becoming more demanding for fire and explosion resistant transformers for use in large generating stations, unit substations, and in network applications. Fire insurance companies are threatening and are raising rates for insurance protection on transformers installed in buildings or in industrial plants where human life is endangered. Oil-filled transformers are not approved by Underwriters for such indoor usage. Askarel-filled transformers, although approved, have been known to liberate toxic gases under certain conditions. And besides, some 500 gallons of such liquid, which is now almost impossible to procure, is required per 1000 KVA of transformer rating."
"The first successful metallic rectifier was the cuprous oxide type first announced in 1920. In spite of the fact that several other types have been discovered since, there have been no other oxide rectifiers reported, and only a few patents have even referred to possibilities. The reasons for this presumably lie in the stringent requirements for a rectifier. First, the oxide must be formed as a thin, tightly adhering film; the oxide composition must be controllable so that it is a semiconductor with a suitable relatively high conductivity; and finally, in some way, an asymmetric potential barrier must be formed at a semiconductor-metal interface, in the Mott picture a thin insulating layer of different composition. It was believed that these conditions might be satisfied with titanium metal and its oxide."
"Fluid resins capable of complete solidification have been available since the end of the war. The contribution that these materials can make to the industry is based upon their ability to produce void-free structures, and to completely fill any cavity in which they are cured. The benefits which may be derived from this property can be itemized as: 1. Absence of corona from windings, operating at high dielectric stress, particularly at high altitudes 2. Improved heat transfer properties by means of a solid path from the source of heat to the surroundings 3. More effective seals against the entrance of moisture and corrosive atmospheres 4. Superior mechanical strength of impregnated windings 5. Ability to form molded exterior insulations by casting processes which require no pressure"
"Mica in the form of mica paper will soon make its appearance as a component, in electrical insulation. This revolutionary advancement in the use of mica will make available to the electrical manufacturer products which have heretofore been impossible to produce."
"A type of coaxial cable with an air dielectric and aluminum outer conductor which has been in use in Europe since 1948 up to about 200 mc., has been found by recent measurements to be highly efficient in the range 1,000 to 10,000 mc. The cable consists of an inner conductor of copper around which a helical spacer has been built up of polystyrene tapes 2 to 6 mils in thickness, the spacer being covered with an insulating sheath consisting of two layers of polystyrene tape 1 inch or more in width, and over this is the outer conductor of aluminum. The helix occupies in present designs 10 to 12 percent of the dielectric, the remainder being gas."
"The Bureau would like to receive from industry, and, in particular, from equipment manufacturers, the following types of information on electrical insulating materials: (1) the weak points of the materials, (2) experiences in the use of the materials in equipment, and (3) comments on specification limits for the materials. Data is presented on key properties of three types of insulating materials; high temperature vinyl tubing, silicone varnished fiber-glass cloths, and silicone-glass laminates, with the end in view of encouraging comment along the above lines."
"This paper deals with one phase of a general study of the microbiological deterioration of rubber and similar insulations. In the earlier papers 2 types of microbial attack were shown: 1) direct eating of natural rubber insulation, 2) production of micropores thru walls of both natural and synthetic rubber insulation, or neoprene jackets."
"The stabilization of chlorinated capacitor impregnants by chemical additives has been practiced by a number of capacitor manufacturers for several years. Anthraquinone has been the most widely used stabilizer, and has been added to chlorinated diphenyl and chlorinated naphthalene to the extent of 0.5 to 1.0% by weight. The purpose of stabilization is to increase the d.c. life and to avoid undesirable changes in insulation resistance and power factor of capacitors in d.c. service. The benefit is illustrated by the 10- to 300- fold increase in life observed in accelerated life tests. The improvement noted in a particular case depends upon the nature and concentration of stabilizer and the conditions of test."
"It has been assumed that the potential energy barrier hindering the rotation of chain molecules about their long axes in the solid state has one deep minimum and equation other minima with a potential energy V above that of the deeper well. Reasons are given for believing this approximates the true situation. Application of the Bragg-Williams approximation to this system, leads to the prediction of first-order thermal and dielectric transitions. The model indicates the existence of two Debye-type loss regions below the transition temperature, but only one above. It the molecules are regarded as rigid, the theory indicates (1) the entropy of transition, Rln equation, should be constant with chain length and (2) the transition temperatures of a homologous series should, rise linearly with increasing chain length. Data from the literature, dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and specific heat data on equation, equation and equation confirm the above predictions. Kirkwood's equation is used to calculate the static dielectric constants. Four different methods of obtaining equation indicate that it is close to 12. Reasons are given for believing that neither of the loss regions is of the pure resonance absorption type, and the sometimes extant belief that the dielectric and thermal effects at the melting and transition points of pure long-chain compounds are of the second order is criticized."
"The dielectric properties of a series of long-chain esters have been investigated in the solid state. Like other long-chain molecules containing 20 or more carbon atoms, most of the ester molecules showed evidence of hindered molecular rotation about their long axes in the crystal lattice. It was also found that higher dielectric constants resulted when the samples were rapidly frozen than when they were allowed to solidify gradually, the effect being more pronounced as the chain length was increased. In order to explain this behavior, it has been assumed that the esters may crystallize in an ordered lattice in which the dipoles are in a plane, or in a longitudinally disordered lattice in which some at the chains are reversed. In the latter case, the dipoles may or may not form two planes, depending upon the position of, the polar group in the chain. It has also been assumed that the degree of longitudinal disorder increases with increase in freezing rate. Once frozen in, however, it remains fixed until the sample is remelted."
"The dielectric loss of poly o-chlorostyrene plasticized with 20% by weight of diphenyl has been measured with the automatic recorder developed previously (Insulation Conference NRC 1950) in the range 15 cps to 3 × 105 cps and from room temperature to 150°C. The pure polymer, and likewise pure polystyrene show time effects due to thermal history which are absent in sufficiently plasticized material."
"Further measurements of dielectric constant and loss, in the microwave region have been carried out upon pure polar liquids and upon solutions of polar molecules in non-polar liquids of widely varying viscosities. Earlier measurements showed that the wavelength at which the loss was a maximum, that is, the critical wavelength, increased with increasing viscosity of the liquid and size of the molecule, usually, conforming poorly to the requirements of the Debye theory. New measurements show that spherical polar molecules orient in an alternating electric field with only slight dependence upon the viscosity of the medium, while unsymmetrical molecules which displace their neighbors in the process of orientation are much more dependent upon the viscosity of the liquid. Dipole-dipole forces between molecules displace the region of maximum loss to longer wavelengths, that is, lower frequencies."
"The paper gives a calculation of the static dielectric constant of ice using Frőhlich's general theory of the static dielectric constant and a recent generalization of it for anisotropic materials2. The calculation is made with the principal assumption that an ice crystal containing N molecules can take up any of (3/2)N configurations, each with equal probability, in the manner proposed by Pauling.3 The calculation includes the effect of interactions up to and including the third nearest neighbors of a given molecule. The dielectric constant thus calculated is in good agreement with the experimental values at present available. It seems, therefore, that Pauling's hypothesis although difficult to justify leads to the correct value for the dielectric constant of ice. The anisotropy of the static dielectric constant is probably small but no exact calculation has been possible."
"Assuming the distribution function for relaxation times equation proposed by Fuoss and Kirkwood1, it can be shown that for equation equation where ω is the cyclic frequency of the applied field and equation is the most probable time of relaxation; equation and equation is the parameter of the distribution function of Fuoss and Kirkwood."
"The electron emission characteristics of the surface of the cathode used in the study of the electric breakdown of insulators are believed to have a fundamental bearing on electric strengths observed. It has been suggested that the formation of a negative space charge is the mechanism through which this influence is exerted1."
