"The equation governing the shape of a condenser's plates, which if placed in a beat-frequency oscillator would give a logarithmic frequency scale, is developed."
"The radio interference situation is rapidly becoming so serious as to make improvements in both methods of detection and methods of elimination absolutely imperative. The most effective method in interference detection is that combining the good features of the intensity method, with the circuit selection features of the directional method, coupled with extensive experience, both in the field and in the laboratory. A light, self-contained, compact, unidirectional receiver equipped with a visible indicating audibility meter is the proposed instrument most desired for this work. The design of filter systems intended to drain interference from circuits should incorporate suitable impedances at points where reflection is likely to occur."

"Recent criticism by Carson of the statement of the reciprocal relations in a radio communication system given by Sommerfeld is supported by a simple example showing the incorrectness of this statement. Carson's proof of the extention of Rayleigh's reciprocity theorem to a general electromagnetic system was limited to u= 1 and to sources consisting of ponderomotive forces on the electricity. A new proof is given under more general conditions, I, YJ, cr being merely restricted to be scalars and the impressed forces are of the electric type introduced by Heaviside and Abraham. These may be regarded as impressed charges and currents, including ether displacement current. The theorem is finally stated in terms of volume and surface integrals, and thus combines the viewpoints of both Lorentz and Carson. The reciprocity relations in a mechanical system are reviewed. The interconnection of electrical and mechanical systems is next considered and a \"transduction coefficient\" is defined. This concept is useful in formulating mechanical problems in electric-circuit form. An example of symmetrical transductance(copper coil in steady magnetic field) is given. The subject of units is taken up and it is proposed that in order to bring the mechanical quantities into agreement with the electrical ones when the latter are expressed in \"practical\" units, the mechanical quantities be expressed in \"mechanical-volts,\" amperes, etc., i.e., in \"practical-electric units of the mechanical quantities.\" A table for converting the principal mechanical quantities from c.g.s. to practical-electrical units is given."
"Two reciprocal theorems, the generalized Rayleigh theorem and the Sommerfeld-Pfrang theorem are of great theoretical importance in radiocommunication. A careful analysis of these theorems and their mathematical derivations shows that they are quite distinct and their practical fields of application different. In particular it shows that the Sommerfeld-Pfrang theorem labors under restrictions, implicit in its mathematical derivation, which seriously limit its field of practical applicability."
"A method of measuring direct capacitance in the range 10-10to 10-15farads by a charging current at radio frequencies is described. A low resistance current indicator is shunted across one of the direct capacitances. The charging current I = ωEC is a measure of the direct capacitance provided that COE is maintained constant. A simple circuit arrangement provides an apparatus giving reliable results measured visually by substitution with a standard. The method has been practically applied in the measurement of direct capacitances present in vacuum tubes providing data for design purposes and for control of product uniformity. The method is specially advantageous in its ability to measure exceedingly small direct capacitances present in screen-grid tubes."
"In spite of the widespread use of radio-frequency power amplifiers, apparently no measurements of the power required to drive such amplifiers have ever been made. In this paper, a study of driving power is made at 60 cycles. It is found that the power input to the grid is proportional to the d-c grid current raised to the 1.34 power. The proportionality factor depends on the type of tube and the plate circuit conditions. With constant grid current the grid power input is found to be practically independent of grid bias voltage. A simple theory, based on an assumed relation between grid current and voltage, agrees quite well with the experimental results. Data are then given on six types of commercial air cooled transmitting tubes showing driving power, a-c driving voltage, gross power output and efficiency as functions of the d-c grid current. Finally, the effects of primary and secondary electron emission by the grid on the driving power are considered."
"This paper gives the mathematics of the four-electrode tube, including in the most general case expressions for the plate and two grid currents in terms of applied voltages in the two grid circuits and the impedances of all three circuits. The results are exact, variation in the amplification factors being included. Because of the complexity of the general equations, these expressions for the currents have been developed: I, in terms of one grid-filament voltage and external impedances in plate and other grid circuit, assuming no voltage in latter; II, in terms of grid-filament voltages of both grid circuits and external impedance in plate circuit; III, in terms of applied voltages in both grid circuits and external impedances in plate and two grid circuits. The results of I show the effect of an external impedance in the non-control grid of a \"screen-grid\" or \"space-charge-grid\" tube; II covers the approximate theory of a \"double-function\" tube; III gives a more exact and comprehensive theory of the tube in any use."
"The present paper is concerned with a study of design methods for soft magnetic materials such as those used in radio broadcast receivers and similar apparatus. The design of such devices as interstaged transformers calls for more than choosing points on curves in a standard handbook and computing mechanical or electrical details by ordinary power transformer theory. Radio transformer design is usually complicated by the effect of passing d-c space current through the winding or by the use of an air-gap to prevent saturation of the core by uni-directional current. The procedure to follow when one of these disturbing effects is present is not very difficult, but it becomes somewhat involved if an efficignt design is wanted when both are present. In this paper an attempt is made to present a workable method of taking account of these disturbing effects. The method intvolves the determination of the apparent and maximum obtainable permeabilities of the magnetic materials so that a proper conclusion nay be arrived at by an application of simple engineering methods."
"Graphic records of radio signals transmitted from high-frequency aircraft radio transmitters are observed to show periodic variations of fairly constant frequency over considerable time intervals. A theory is evolved connecting this frequency with the transmitting distance, the ground speed of the plane and the effective height of the Kennelly-Heaviside Layer. Records of such periodic fading are reproduced from which, in accordance with this theory, the height of the layer is computed. A short discussion is given of the results obtained."
"The data presented are the product of an investigation started at the beginning of 1928 with the object of studying the short-period fading of radio broadcast transmissions. Particular attention was paid to those intensity changes which take place during periods ranging from a few seconds to several minutes. Various antenna combinations were used in making simultaneous records in order to separate the effects of various causes of fading. The data secured partly confirm the conclusions of previous investigations, partly point to other sources of fading. Varying intensity of the indirect ray and interference between indirect and ground rays are evidenced as in earlier experiments, but rotation of the plane of polarization of the indirect ray is also shown to be a considerable factor and there are suggestions of lateral direction shifts of the indirect rays and of their arrival by multiple paths."

"A new standard of frequency is described in which three 100,000-cycle quartz crystal-controlled oscillators of very high constancy are employed. These are interchecked automatically and continuously with a precision of about one part in one hundred million. They are checked daily in terms of radio time signals by the usual method employing a clock controlled by current maintained at a sub-multiple of the crystal frequency. Specially shaped crystals are used which have been adjusted to have temperature coefficients less than 0.0001 per cent per degree C."
"The characteristics of piezo-electric quartz crystal plates of the perpendicular or Curie cut are compared with parallel or 30-deg. cut plates with reference to the type of vibration of the most active modes, the frequency of these modes as a function of the dimensions, and the magnitude and sign of the temperature coefficients of these frequencies. It is pointed out that the two principle modes of the perpendicular cut plate appear to be of the longitudinal type, the high-frequency mode being a function of the thickness while the low-frequency is a function of the width (along the electric axis). Both modes have a negative temperature coefficient of frequency. Of the two corresponding modes of the parallel cut plates, a shear vibration is responsible for the high frequency. This frequency has a positive temperature coefficient. The low-frequency mode is of the longitudinal type and has a negative temperature coefficient. Considering only the high-frequency vibration of these plates it is observed that there are characteristic variations of the frequency and temperature coefficient with the ratio of dimensions of the plate and the temperature, which are peculiar to the parallel cut plate. These variations can be attributed to a coupling of the shear and longitudinal modes. It is then shown that if the parallel cut plate be treated as a group of coupled oscillatory systems with appropriate temperature coefficients the usual coupled system analysis will explain the curves of frequency vs. dimensional ratio, frequency vs. temperature, and temperature coefficient vs."
"By using the Kyle principle of construction, it has been possible to develop a practicable condenser loud speaker. The Kyle construction uses a flexible dielectric diaphragm in contact with the high points of a rigid, undulated metal plate. The electrodes of the condenser are the rigid plate and a flexible metal layer attached to the opposite surface of the dielectric. A comparatively large actuating force is thereby obtained and at the same time sufficient amplitude of motion is permitted to give efficient and faithful reproduction."
"The paper describes briefly the method of recording the strength of long-wave radio signals used at the Bureau of Standards and gives some of the results obtained. The curves shown indicate the great variability of the wave propagation both in regard to strength and the angle of incidence of the downcomning wave. This variability appears to be greater for transmission distances below 1000 km than for greater distances. An apparent connection is shown in certain cases between the night signal variations and magnetic storms. The observations seem to indicate that the downcoming waves are reflected (or refracted) from rapidly changing masses of ionized gas."
"This paper presents the results of a study of an apparent inter-relationship between radio reception and changes in the earth's magnetism. The results show that for long-wave daylight reception over great distances 4,000 to 7,100 km) there is in general a variable but definite increase in the intensity of the received signal following the height of severe magnetic disturbance. This increase reaches its maximum in from one to two days and disappears in from four to five days. For moderate distances (250 to 450 km) there is an increase in the intensity of the received signal noticeable before as well as after the magnetic storm reaches a maximum. These changes in intensity cover periods from two to four days both before and after the magnetic storm reaches its height."
"The utility of directional data on static is shown, and two types of apparatus devised for such a directional investigation are compared. It is shown that a method which gives the direction of individual crashes is superior to integrating methods. The distribution of thunderstorms over the world is discussed, and comparisons are drawn between this distribution and the observed directional distribution of static. Probable geographical locations are assigned to the sources, based upon thunderstorm data and directional observations."
"The method of making \"zero beat\" measurements of the operating frequencies of broadcast stations in the Second Radio District is described, showing the method of comparing the received signal from a broadcasting station with a signal of known frequency, obtained from a 10-kc multivibrator controlled by a 90-kc quartz crystal. There is also given a description of the method used in reducing the measurement to a flexible routine procedure while still maintaining an accuracy well within the 500-cycle limit established by the Federal Radio Commission."
"A comparative study of low-frequency signals of high power stations in the Pacific area has been made, with particular reference to relative attenuation in north and south directions as compared with attenuattons in east and west directions. A comparison of observed field strengths in microvolts per meter with the results calculated by various proposed formulas has been made. While the agreement is none too good with any of the formulas, the results indicate that east and west attenuation is decidedly greater than north and south during the daylight hours in the fairly high latitudes. They also indicate that in comparing observed results with different transmission formulas due account must be taken of the type of experiments upon which the formulas in question were based. It is suggested that by the inclusion of terms in the formulas, depending upon both direction and latitude, it might be possible to construct or modify some of the existing formulas to fit the general case."

"The simple theory for the computation of reflecting or multibranch antenna systems is sketched. If the points at which observations of electrical quantities are to be made are definitely specified, a knowledge of the self and mutual impedances (properly defined) between antennas is sufficient to make the computations determinate. Of the circuit constants, the most useful and accessible is the antenna current ratio 2 i( 4-( 2rd/ X) ) K1, = II = Koe and in the work here reported ϕ has been measured in the range 0.33λ to 1λ. Experiment has shown that in this range ϕ is that theoretically calculable for a Hertzian doublet. Actually this range is equivalent to λ/3 to ∞. The discussion of experimental procedure is purposely thorough."
"A description is given of a series of experiments carried out between two ground stations, and between an airplane and a ground station, to determine whether it is possible to obtain with relatively low power reliable short-wave communication over distances of 500 km, or more. Continuous-wave transmitters supplying a constant power of two watts were employed throughout the experiments. Results at fixed distances are recorded and discussed, particularly with regard to fading in summer and winter. An airplane installation, operating into a fixed dipole antenna is described, and the results of a large number of observations at ground receiving stations, of the signals received from the airplane in flight are presented."
"The desirable properties for an instrument for measuring frequencies over the audible range are briefly mentioned and a suggested electrically excited monochord is considered. In practice certain difficulties are found and lead to a proposal for employing the harmonic modes of vibration of the stretched wire. The theory of this is given, as well as the relation between the frequency response and the position of a movable bridge. The constructional details and the method of calibration from a single tuning fork are described in turn. Miscellaneous considerations concerning the practical operation conclude the paper."
"An empirical equation for the grid-current grid-voltage curve of the C-327 tube is developed. By obtaining the derivatives of this equation rather than determining them from the ig-eg, curve by graphical means the inaccuracy of the graphical methods is avoided. The equation holds accurately in the range of eGencountered in practice."
"The paper gives a brief discussion of the modern tendencies in radio broadcast receiver design, with particular regard to those characteristics of receivers which are related to the problem of allocation and regulation of broadcasting stations. These characteristics are separated into five classes, as follows: (1) discrimination between channels; (2) discrimination within a channel; (3) uniformity of reception in all channels; (4) uniformity of reception within a channel; (5) range of reception. The conclusions are based upon experimental studies of a large number of broadcast receivers which have been sold commercially, and others which will be sold during the present year."
"This paper is a brief discussion of some of the outstanding technical problems of radio broadcast regulation with particular reference to the transmitting equipment. It is pointed out that in the interests of continued progress the regulatory program should be based on the following considerations: (1) Intensive development of the available frequency band: (2) Close adherence to the technical facts; (3) Definite expression of performance standards in proper quantitative terms. A number of the more important transmitter problems are discussed from this standpoint, including the power rating of stations, increments of power, degree of modulation, location of stations with respect to populous areas, permissible intensity of harmonics, frequency, stability, and fidelity."
"The purpose of this paper is to present a brief history of the Radio Inspection Service of the Department of Commerce from its inception July 1, 1911, up to and including the present day, together with an outline of the scope and general nature of the work performed by this important agency of the Government.

"A brief recount of some of the major contributions to radio field intensity measurement work is given, showing that these represent a great deal of the groundwork on which future developments will be based. The general problems of this sort of measurement work are discussed, as well as the equipment with which the Radio Division of the Department of Commerce expects to handle them. Typical illustrations of radio transmission in cities are given, showing the necessity and importance of field intensity surveys in the location of radio stations. The prediction is made that the time will come when all radio broadcast transmitters of 1 kw or more power will be located on the basis of radio field intensity surveys."
"Part I of this paper gives in detail the development of radio broadcasting in the United States from 1907 to 1928, inclusive; Part II deals with the development of a radio broadcast from the studio to the listener.

"This paper is a continuation of work reported in the Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers for May 1928 by the same authors. A more extended study of echo signals with particular reference to directional characteristics and to diurnal variations has been carried out. Attention has also been given to the question of the relations between the echo signal and the frequency. Distortions, probably due to echo signals, have been recorded on long distance transmission. The relation between the echo signal and effective height of the Kennelly-Heaviside layer has been discussed."
"Van der Pol's hypothesis that group-velocity may account for the retardation of echoes observed by Stoermer is analyzed. It is shown that only under very special circumstances can the electron-distribution be proper. A favorable condition is obtained if the refractive index decreases exponentially with the height. It is shown that by slightly varying the electron-distribution anomalous results for skip-distances should follow. It is suggested that the echoes observed by Stoermer and van der Pol were splashes of the same echo focussed accidentally on a favorable patch of ground."
"Recent observations of the Kennelly-Heaviside layer by the echo-method are described. Multivibrator-modulation was used, giving extremely sharp \"peaks\" on 4,435 and 8,870 kc. Practically all of the observations were made on the former frequency, as 8,870 kc skipped over the receiver, which was very near the transmitter. Two 24-hour series of observations showed a marked diurnal-variation in the effective height of the layer and in the echo-pattern received for each transmitted \"peak.\" The echo-pattern shows multiplicities during the day and evening, but becomes very complex at night. A few observations made during the magnetic disturbance of October 17-19, 1928, showed an unusually great effective height and a change in the echo-pattern. Daytime heights for a number of days during the autumn of 1928 are given."
"Assuming that the atmosphere at the surface of Mars consists of ⅕ oxygen and ⅘ other gases, as nitrogen, etc., the composition of the atmosphere to great heights is calculated, just as was done for the earth, from the actions of gas diffusion and gravity. The electron density in the atmosphere of Mars due to the ultraviolet light of the sun is found to have a maximum value of 1.1 ×105at a height of 440 km above the surface on a summer day, and 0.55×105at 310 km on a winter day: On a summer day the skip distances for 100, 80, 60 and 50-meter waves are 0, 730, 1410 and 2240 km, respectively, and the shortest wave for reliable long distance wireless communication over the surface of Mars is about 47 meters. Winter and night values of these quantities are greater. Because of the skip distances for waves below 100 meters, it would seem that conditions on Mars are not very advantageous for short-wave communication, and it may be conjectured that no wireless apparatus exists there for waves below 100 meters. Waves longer than about 100 meters will not pierce through the atmosphere of the earth. These calculations, apart from other considerations, support the conclusion that only a very optimistic experimenter would look for successful wireless communication between the earth and Mars."
"The objective of this paper is a discussion of some of the important principles underlying the electrical transmission of pictures rather than a description of detailed methods by which such transmission may be effected. The subject, which includes both still pictures and television, is treated as a special form of electrical communication, differing from other forms primarily in the nature of the information conveyed. The necessity for reducing the information represented by a picture or scene to a form where it may be expressed as a single-valued function of time is considered. This function is used as a basis for comparing picture transmission systems with the more familiar telephone and telegraph systems, and for evaluating the amount of information carried by each. The dependence of the rate at which information is train mitted upon the frequency range occupied by the signal is shown to be of fundamental importance. The major portion of the paper is concerned with a study of the relations between the original picture and the transmitted signal as it appears in the several parts of the system. Since the excellence of any system for the transmission of intelligence is measured by the fidelity with which it reproduces the original information, the effect upon the final picture of deviations from ideal performance on the part of each element is examined. Attention is given to the conditions governing the use of modulated waves for the particular forms of signal encountered in picture transmission."
"The basis of a system of television standards suitable for commercial television service, with specific standards, is discussed. The elements considered in this paper are the following: picture proportions, number of scanning elements, number of picture repetitions per second, scanning method and direction, phase of transmitted current. Synchronizing is considered, with possible methods, and also various arrangements for utilizing the television channel."
"This article describes the radio facilities at Radio Washington. There is included a brief description of receiving equipment and of methods of control of transmitters in use at the Navy Department, Radio Central, and of the transmitting equipment installed at Arlington, Va., and Annapolis, Md."
"The paper contains a discussion of the causes and effects of microphonic disturbances in small receiving tubes and the nature of these disturbances, and gives methods of testing for microphonic disturbance whereby the sources of the disturbance may be located and corrected, as well as methods of testing tubes as a means of comparison of individual tubes of different types. A new type of tube with low microphonic output but with low filament power for uses where microphonic troubles may be serious is also described and its characteristics are given."
"This paper is presented in two parts. In Part I two fundamental equivalence theorems concerning a triode and its circuits are rigorously derived. These theorems give the simple circuits which are equivalent to the plate and grid circuits of the triode. These equivalent circuits contain only constant circuit elements and fictitious electromotive forces, the use of which greatly simplifies the calculation of currents in the triode circuits when the electrical variations are small. In Part II the equivalence theorems are used to obtain the equivalent input and internal output admittances of a triode with its associated circuits."
"A commonly used method is described for obtaining crystal control of high-frequency transmitters from crystals of lower frequency by means of a frequency multiplying vacuum-tube amplifier. An experimental study of the operation of the system is made when doubling and tripling the frequency of a 4000-kc crystal-controlled oscillator, and comparisons are made with the operation of the same system when balanced and amplifying the fundamental frequency. Relations between d-c negative grid voltage and r-f input voltage for maximum efficiency are shown to be critical and nearly constant for any one order of multiplication. Satisfactory operation of the system is shown to depend upon inductive reactance in the grid circuit, which produces regeneration through the grid-plate feed back in the tube. The study is based on circuit efficiencies as measured by the contact pyrometer method."

A new method of measuring high voltages is described, in which the current through a water resistor is recorded on an oscillograph. Over a million volts to ground was measured with an accuracy believed to be better than 2 per cent. A calibration of the meter sphere gap was determined for voltages up to 1100 kv. and the arc-over voltages for point gaps were determined for distances up to 30 ft. Point to plane arc-over voltages were also measured. Included in the report are some tests made in connection with the shielding of the water resistor determining to what extent capacity currents were causing error. Sphere gaps were also used in connection with the determination of the arc-over voltages of the point gaps to determine whether there was any high frequency, set up by the heavy corona streamers from the point, that could not be recorded by the oscillograph. The procedure of taking an oscillogram of the corona current from a pointed electrode a million volts above ground is described. The practicability of the use of the meter sphere gap for voltage measurement is discussed."
"Gaseous-conductor lamps are finding a wide field of application in advertising and display lighting. A brief discussion of the theory of the high-voltage type is included. The electrical characteristics of typical high-voltage lamps were investigated by the use of indicating instruments, Duddell and cathode ray oscillographs. Characteristic curves, data, and oscillograms are given. Power-factor improvement was studied and data covering two methods of correction are included."
"This paper describes the recently constructed electrolytic zinc plant of the Sullivan Mining Company which is located near Kellogg, Idaho. The first unit which has just been completed has a capacity of 50 tons of slab zinc per day. Provision has been made for two additional units which will bring the capacity up to 150 tons per day. The ``Tainton-Pring'' electrolytic process, which uses strong acid for leaching and high current density for electrolysis, is employed in this plant. The metallurgical process and the physical layout of the plant are briefly described, after which follows a general discussion of the electrical features."
"The paper gives first a brief history of the series of improvements to better operating conditions over the Cascade Range which have been undertaken by the Great Northern Railway since the line was put in operation in 1893, and refers briefly to the three-phase electrification of the Cascade Tunnel put in operation in 1909. The paper next gives (Part II) a description and the principal operating characteristics of the motor-generator type of locomotives now in service on the electrified section from Skykomish (Washington) to Cascade Tunnel Station, and to be used through the new tunnel and extension of electrification to Wenatchee when work now in progress is completed. Part III gives a description of the electric transmission and distribution system along the railroad line with particular emphasis on the relay protection designed to guard the system so far as practicable against interruption of power supply at the locomotives. Part IV describes the three-point power supply and includes a description of the frequency converter stations at Skykomish and Wenatchee for converting the 110,000-volt, 60-cycle, three-phase power purchased at these points to 25-cycle, single-phase power required for the traction service."
"This paper deals, in a general way, with the several systems of automatic block signaling, particularly the a-c. system, and the apparatus commonly used to insure continuity of power supply. It covers briefly the older phases of the subject and more specifically the later applications. The most modern system of continuous inductive train control, the code system, has required the development of frequency-converting apparatus for this use. Within the past three years, a number of frequency-converting automatic substations has been installed by the railway companies. The class of apparatus used in these stations is discussed, including some details of installations on the Pennsylvania and Long Island Railroads."
"The development of the commercial mercury arc rectifier is outlined briefly in this paper and there are given the advantages which led to its adoption in a double-unit automatic station recently installed by the Los Angeles Railway. A report is made of the very satisfactory operation which has resulted. A description of the station is given and methods of operation and maintenance are presented."
"When overhead lines carry large short-circuit currents, the resulting magnetic forces on the conductors are such as to cause the cables to be repelled to greater distances than the usual spacings. The elementary principles involved are stated. A single-phase short circuit is shown to be the one producing the greatest movements. A theoretical calculation of the forces and actual experience showed the necessity of making tests to study the problem. A description of the tests indicates how photographic records of the movements of relatively large cables were obtained. The results of over 330 tests are shown by pictures and curves. The effects of a variation in each of the five principal variables, cable size, span length, spacing, tension, and current are discussed. A mathematical expression is derived by means of which the maximum movement of conductors in a horizontal plane can be approximately determined. It has been found possible to set up a miniature test with small wire that very closely duplicates to a small scale the movements of a larger conductor. The results indicate that it is necessary for moderately large systems to take account of these short-circuit forces in the design of their overhead systems. There is a large field for research on this subject and more work should be done."
"In the problem of inductive coordination of power and communication systems, residual voltages and currents in the power lines are an important element, yet it is apparent that they are not in general well understood, Studies have been made and others are under way by well-equipped organizations, which will add much to the data concerning them. In this paper the general principles which apply are briefly reviewed and applied to typical power circuits and networks, and oscillograms are shown which verify the theory presented."
"The inherent advantages of carrier-current telephony over high-voltage power transmission lines during the past five years have resulted in an unusually rapid development of this form of communication. To one who has not been constantly in touch with this rapid development, the necessity for the numerous types of carrier-current telephone equipment now available is not always apparent. This paper gives a brief outline of modern communication requirements in this field, the problems involved in providing this communication, and a brief outline of the different types of equipment now available to provide the required communication."
"This paper describes a new carrier telephone system which is designed for use in the telephone plant as a substitute for open-wire line construction for circuits of shorter lengths than have been economical heretofore. This system, which is known as the type D carrier telephone system, provides one additional talking circuit per pair of wires. The equipment is adapted to provide facilities quickly, and is capable of being moved readily from one location to another when temporary facilities are desired. The system employs a novel and original modulation circuit which is fully described."
"This paper outlines the present status of lightning arrester application on transmission lines and suggests future investigations to determine the most effective design and method of application. Information from klydonograph tests is presented to show that lightning arresters are needed on both high-voltage and low-voltage lines. It is suggested that present practise in both design and application has limitations which may be overcome with the result of better protection which will be economically justified."
"Lightning phenomena are analyzed in the light of laboratory experience with high-voltage phenomena in the atmosphere. Special emphasis is placed on the effect of space charges in producing high local stresses when mobilized through channels of high conductivity caused by high temperatures. A detailed analysis is included of the steps through which air at atmospheric pressure passes when, due to applied electric stresses, its electric properties change from those of a non-conductor to those of a highly conducting body,-perhaps many times as conducting as a metallic conductor at ordinary temperature,-and then again resumes its original nonconducting properties."
"The heat resistance of the soil surrounding underground cable ducts is usually large, and the path of the heat through the soil is not simple, especially when there are several adjacent ducts. This heat resistance and the path of the heat flow may be determined graphically, but except in the simpler cases, this method becomes very difficult. The heat resistance of any one of several ducts can be calculated theoretically by making assumptions of unknown magnitudes. To check these calculations by testing actual installations would be slow and expensive. Advantage may be taken of the similarity between the flow of heat and the flow of electricity to set up and test the electrical equivalent of any duct system. In this way the theoretical results can be checked readily with a minimum outlay of equipment. Results obtained by this method show the theoretical calculations to be accurate even for close spacing and also give a picture of the actual path of the heat from a group of several ducts, Thus, the heat resistance of a duct may be found quite accurately if the specific heat resistance of the soil is known."
"Under modern conditions of operation the ability of the component machines of a power system to hold in step during system disturbances has become of major importance in the choice of system layout and machine design. This situation has greatly stimulated activity in the study of the problems involved. This paper reviews the general problem in the light of recent analytical and experimental studies made by the authors. The subject matter of the paper is grouped according to the following headings: Part I reviews the factors affecting stability, including generator short-circuit ratio, voltage regulators, excitation systems, neutral impedance, governors, amortisseurs, intermediate condensers. Part II gives methods of calculating stability, under the following heads: preliminary calculations, idealized case of two machines, general case of two machines, extension to include more than two machines, simplified method of calculating tie lines. The appendixes include an example illustrating the method of calculation in a particular case."
"This paper develops a formula for calculating the capacitance between two wires of a three-conductor cable. A direct method of calculation is employed, based on the work of Doctor H. B. Dwight. This method gives accurate results independent of empirical or restricted premises."
"In hydroelectric surveys it is difficult to fix the positions of the soundings when the survey ship is beyond the range of visibility of shore objects; the radio-acoustic method is designed to help in meeting this difficulty. Temporary shore stations are set up, each equipped with a microphone placed in the water in a known position and connected with an amplifier ashore through a cable; the amplifier is in turn connected through a relay to an automatic key driven by clockwork, which causes a radio transmitter to send out a characteristic signal whenever the microphone is disturbed. When the position of the ship is wanted, a small bomb is fired in the water alongside the ship; the instant of the explosion is automatically recorded on a chronograph aboard the ship. The sound of the explosion disturbs the shore station microphone and the resulting characteristic radio signals of the shore stations are received on board the ship and also recorded on the chronograph. Thus the ship obtains the time of travel of sound in water from her position to each of the shore station microphones, which are in known positions. The speed of sound in sea water being known, the ship's position is thus fixed. The method has been used successfully in the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey with the ship 75 mi. or more away from the shore stations. A device for quick plotting on the field sheet is described. The accuracy of the method is discussed."
"This paper invites the attention of the engineering profession to the advantages and economies which may be obtained by coordinating both hydro and steam power stations of various kinds, and electric transmission and distribution lines serving a large industrial territory in a unified and centrally controlled system. For illustration, a general description of the generating and distribution system of the Duke Power Company, operating in the Piedmont section of the Carolinas, is given."
"The rapid growth of the Southeastern Power & Light system is noted. The long forecast of system load which has been made together with some other features of development are presented briefly. A short discussion of the routine of operating methods and importance of load dispatching together with interesting features of a new steam unit of 60,000-kw. capacity, and interesting features of design for a hydro plant at Jordan Dam rapidly nearing completion are included."
"The experience of the Alabama Power Company with carrier-current telephony over power lines and supervisory control is outlined in the paper. A sketch is included of the early development of these systems, and this is followed by descriptions of the systems later installed throughout the Company's territory. In an Appendix extracts are given from the general specifications for the equipment employed in the systems."
"The use of high-voltage power lines for carrier-current communication presents a number of difficulties not met in the use of simple communication circuits. This paper tells how these difficulties may be overcome without resorting to complicated transmitting and receiving equipment. The advantages of employing tuned choke coils are described. These chokes are used to isolate the communication channel from the remainder of the power system which gives in effect a simple communication circuit between communicating points."
"For the most part this paper is a discussion of the mechanism of insulator flashover. The breakdown of air between electrodes, with particular consideration of the effect of various factors upon the flashover characteristics of insulator strings equipped with arcing rings, is discussed. It is shown that critical dimensions and spacings of arcing rings exist for a given insulator string. If the arcing rings are designed to lie on the safe side of this critical point, cascading flashovers will not occur. If the arcing ring dimensions are below the critical values, cascading may or may not occur depending upon the nature of the applied voltage wave. Data from tests, which determined the limiting physical dimensions of arcing rings that will prevent cascading under all types of impressed voltages, are presented."
"A brief discussion is given of the various forms of electrical discharges as they are characterized by the physicists. Oscillographic records secured of voltages and currents, both before and during the flashovers, are reproduced and discussed. Polarity tests are described in which the electrode shape and spacing were found to determine the sign of the half-cycle at which flashovers would start. Photographic results obtained with moving films are illustrated, showing the various stages of a flashover from the formation of the corona discharges, through the initial sparkover, to the development of the half-cycle arc channels. The flashovers studied ranged from several feet to 22 ft. in length. Spectrographic analyses of the different stages of a flashover are described, wherein it is possible to gain some knowledge of several of the factors contributing to the conductivities of the various stages. Several of the spectra obtained are illustrated along with a comparison spectrum of lightning. With the knowledge gained from the laboratory studies made, the probable history of a high-voltage a-c. flashover is summarized."
"This paper deals with the subject from the stand-point of the public utility and the application of the electrical equipment in the mills, outlining the past and present practise with forecasts of the practises and developments of the future. Brief discussions are included of the advantages and disadvantages of purchased power over generated power and of the individual drive over the group drive. Statistical data are given on the percentage of the total spindles now operated on electric drive in the Southeast as well as the range of horse power requirement of various textile machinery and the cost per spindle for electrifying mills on various cotton produtcts."
"The general subject of stability and power limits has been discussed several times before the Institute. Most of the papers have been of a theoretical nature, presenting methods by which the power limit of a system could be calculated, or describing various schemes by which the power limit could be increased. Some papers have been written describing tests on miniature systems and a few, giving the results of tests on actual high-voltage systems on the Pacific Coast. Calculations and tests on small models have indicated that power systems at or near the theoretical power limit could not be operated safely, since any slight disturbance would cause instability with the resultant separation of the power transmission system. Very often, tests on small models do not closely check the results obtained on the real system: therefore, as a result of certain troubles which occurred on the Southeastern Power and Light Company's System in 1925, apparently due to instability, it was decided to attempt to determine by actual tests the amounts of power which could be safely carried over certain transmission lines, and to compare the results with the calculated values."
"During the past few years, intensive research work has been carried out on some photoelectric and glow-discharge devices. More recently, certain applications of these devices to the industry have been undertaken. This paper presents some of the results attained."

"The paper describes a series of experiments on the fundamental electrical properties of a number of waxes and oils, such as are used in composite high-voltage insulation. Particular attention has been directed to dielectric absorption as the origin of dielectric loss and the probable cause of deterioration and short life. The relation of the properties of the constituent parts to the properties of mixtures has been examined, with special reference to purification methods and the influence of small amounts of impurities. The studies have also afforded opportunity to test the validity of certain existing theories of absorption and loss. The method of experiment is the recording of short time absorption curves by means of the string galvanometer. Charge and discharge curves have been traced from a small fraction of a second following the beginning of charge or discharge, these curves having been brought much nearer to their beginnings than any heretofore recorded. It is this region near the beginning of these phenomena, which is most important in its bearing on dielectric loss. The principal results are summarized at the end of the paper, among the most striking being: (a) The extensive evidence that dielectric absorption is purely a conduction phenomenon; (b) The conductivity of dielectrics is highly anomalous in character, sometimes increasing, sometimes decreasing with increases in voltage and temperature. Absorption always follows the conductivity in these changes."
"The purpose of this investigation is to give a mathematical theory of the cyclograms of corona obtained by a cathoderay oscillograph. In the case investigated a long wire of small diameter is connected to one terminal of an a-c. source; the other terminal of the source is connected to a concentric cylinder of considerable diameter or to a metal plate at some distance from the wire. A cathoderay oscillograph with two pairs of deflecting plates, at right angles to each other, is so connected that one pair of plates causes deflections of the cathode beam proportional to the values of instantaneous voltage of the source, and the other pair of plates causes deflections proportional to the instantaneous values of the charging and loss current flowing into the wire. As long as the sinusoidal amplitude of the applied voltage is below the visual corona point, the charging current is also sinusoidal, in time quadrature with the voltage. The oscillograph record is therefore an ellipse, with the amplitudes of the voltage and the current as the principal semiaxes. When, however, the minimum ionization voltage is exceeded during a part of each alternation, the cyclogram ceases to be an ellipse, but consists of four portions per cycle, two of which correspond to the intervals of time during which the corona is extinct, and the other two when corona is present, with quite short transients in between. F. W. Peek (A. I. E. E. TRANS., Vol. XLVI, 1927, p."
"It is shown that the flux linkages of a circuit may be changed in two very different ways-either the flux may be varied causing a voltage to be induced according to Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction, or the turns may be varied by a substitution of circuit without inducing a voltage. In the Appendix it is mathematically shown that the flux may be changed either by transformer or cutting action, but that the presence of one or the other of these actions is dependent on the choice of reference axes. Thus any argument to the effect that one of them in particular is a necessary part of all induction phenomena is futile. It is possible to identify in every d-c. machine the building up of flux linkages so as to generate a voltage, and the reduction of flux linkages by a substitution of circuit so as not to generate a voltage. The alternate working of these two methods for changing the flux linkages of a circuit is an essential and necessary feature of every d-c. dynamo-electric machine. General criteria are introduced for ascertaining in any given case the nature of the changes in inter-linkages which occur, and whether voltages are induced thereby. By way of application, a new restriction on the use of coefficients of inductance is pointed out, the sliding contact and homopolar machine are discussed, and finally a table has been prepared illustrating the various types of flux linkages found in familiar apparatus."
"This paper deals primarily with the ``solid'' type paper insulated high-tension cable, the development field still ahead being extensive. A review is given of the progress made during the past four years. The research and development work which made this progress possible is outlined, only the more important features being considered. Particular attention is given to void formation both in the factory and in the field, and methods of arriving at some understanding of this are demonstrated. The conclusion is drawn that void formation under service conditions is inherent in paper insulated ``solid'' cables. Methods of reducing the size and duration of voids, and increasing their pressure, thereby reducing the possibility of ionization deterioration, are carefully considered. Oil reservoir feed at the joints is of great value in this respect. This is dealt with in detail. Research data on ionization and other characteristics of finished cable and cable materials are presented."
"This is the second report to be presented before the Institute of the research investigation of ionization phenomena in paper-insulated, high-voltage cables, which is being conducted at the Harvard Engineering School under the auspices of the Impregnated Paper-Insulated Cable Research Committee. This paper is a report of progress and will be followed by further reports as the work progresses. The power dissipated as ionization loss in cables is much more harmful than the power dissipated in the solid dielectric. The paper presents methods of separating this ionization loss from the total dielectric loss occurring in high-voltage impregnated paper cables, the methods being verified experimentally. It consists essentially of seven parts as follows: (1) A description of the apparatus and the method of impregnating cable paper whereby test specimens having practically no occluded gases can be produced. It is necessary to prepare and test samples in this manner in order to determine the law of their dielectric properties over a wide range of voltage gradient. It is only by knowing this law that it becomes possible to separate the ionization loss in the cable from the total dielectric loss. These experiments show that with three typical but widely different types of impregnating compounds, the power factor and capacitance are constant up to gradients as high as from 250 to 300 volts per mil; the power loss is proportional to the voltage squared under these conditions. These results are illustrated with curves."
"The use of single-conductor, lead-covered cable for high-voltage, three-phase transmission lines results in sheath losses ranging from 25 to 300 per cent of the conductor losses for cables installed in separate ducts, unless special methods for the reduction of the losses are used. Some of these methods, while practically eliminating sheath losses, cause a-c. sheath potentials which may be injurious. In this connection the authors have developed a new scheme of bonding and a new bonding device, which appear to have marked advantages. This article consists of a general discussion relative to the reduction of sheath losses with special reference to laboratory tests and field work done on 132 miles of single-conductor cable of the Commonwealth Edison Company. The economics of sheath losses and of the methods for their practical elimination are discussed. The theories of sheath losses and induced voltages are outlined and correlated, and new formulas and curves are developed. An analytical and graphical comparison of sheath bonding connections is presented. Investigations are reported on tests regarding the nature and extent of possible corrosion of sheaths caused by a-c. sheath voltages."
"The losses occurring in single-conductor armored cables whose sheath and armor are bonded and grounded at more than one point are-besides the copper loss and the dielectric loss-the circulating-current losses in the sheath and in the armor, and the additional iron losses in an armor of magnetic material. The circulating-current losses are due to the currents induced in the sheath and armor circuits by the fluxes linking these circuits when these circuits are closed by the bonds or grounding connections. Since the losses obtained in such cables are widely variable, depending on the cable design, both designers and operating engineers desire to know the loss magnitudes obtained in different cases and to have an understanding of the factors tending to give low losses. In this paper the sheath and armor losses have been analyzed for a steel-wire armored cable, a copper-wire armored cable, a steel-tape armored cable, and a cable enclosed in an iron pipe, and have been compared with the losses occurring in a plain lead-covered cable without armor. The data used include test data and calculated values. It is shown that a steel-wire armored 350,000-circular mil single-conductor copper cable with sheath and armor short circuited by low-impedance bonds had a total loss (exclusive of dielectric losses), of 2.8 times the conductor loss, by test in a single-phase 60-cycle circuit at 4 ft. cable spacing, at 260 amperes. The corresponding loss in a similar cable without armor, with lead sheath short circuited, was 2.4 times the conductor loss."
"This paper gives a review of some recent developments in the methods of studying lightning phenomena. The Norinder form of cathode ray oscillograph and its application in Tennessee are discussed, together with the information secured. The second part gives the theory of traveling waves along transmission lines. Reflections at open and grounded ends are considered. A mirror scheme of an infinite series of waves on a double infinite line equivalent to actual waves along a finite line is developed. The third part discusses the manner in which surges are actually produced on lines by lightning and the effect of ground resistance on the protection afforded by ground wires, both with respect to induced and direct strokes."
"This report gives the latest data of the subcommittee on the subject of the protection of transmission lines against lightning by the use of overhead ground wires, special construction, etc. Reports of power companies are included and recommendations of the committee are submitted."
"This paper gives the results of a study of the peculiar variation with temperature and frequency of the dielectric constant and power factor of rosin, rosin oil, and castor oil. It includes data showing at several frequencies the relation of dielectric constant and power factor to the composition of vulcanized rubber. Electrical double refraction in rosin at different frequencies and temperatures is discussed in relation to its behavior as a dielectric. It is shown that the viscosity is a decisive factor controlling both the electrical and optical behavior. The facts are important in themselves but it is possible to interpret them by a modern physical theory, the Debye1 dipole theory, which it is believed has not hitherto been applied to commercial dielectrics. On this theory the anomalous change of dielectric constant and power factor with temperature and frequency is attributed not to impurities or heterogeneity of structure but to molecules containing electric doublets which try to orient themselves in an electric field. The rotation of the dipole molecules in a viscous medium gives rise to frictional heat loss expressed as power factor, and also to a contribution to the dielectric constant which vanishes when the dipoles are prevented from responding by too great viscosity or too high frequency. For the sake of intelligibility, an outline of the dipole theory is first presented and then the experimental results are discussed on the basis of that theory."
"The analytical theory of simple traveling waves along parallel conductors is well known. Its disadvantage is that the relationships among the incoming, reflected, transmitted, and absorbed currents and voltages are expressed by a number of simulaneous equations difficult to grasp, from a physical point of view, in their entirely. For this reason, a graphical theory has been developed according to which all the quantities involved are represented in a so-called star diagram and the whole phenomenon conveyed to the eye quantitatively. The star diagram is then applied to the following practical cases of a simple rectangular-front non-attenuated long traveling wave: (a) Reflection from and absorption in a non-inductive terminal resistance; (b) Reflection from an open-circuited and from a short-circuited end of a line; (c) The case of critical resistance; (d) Repeated reflections from the ends of a line; (e) Discharge of a wave to the ground, directly or through a resistance; (f) Passage of a wave through the junction point of two conductors having different values of surge impedance; (g) Same as (f), only the junction provided with a series or shunted resistance, (h) Effect of a lumped series inductance or shunted capacitance in reducing the steepness of a wave front. In each case, the results agree with those deduced analytically, for example by R. Rüdenberg in his book ``Elektrische Schaltvorgänge.'' Some reciprocal relationships are pointed out at the end and further problems suggested to which the star diagram may be applied."
"Three major features incorporated in the Deion circuit-breaker are discussed. They are: deionization at solid surfaces, the function of the static balancer, and cold electrode arcs."
"The operating principles of a new type of air circuit breaker for alternating currents are herein outlined together with results of field test of a 2000-ampere, 15,000-volt, three-phase unit. The special testing facilities of the Commonwealth Edison Company used for the test, the performances of the air circuit breakers under test, and the effects of the test currents on the power system are described."
"High-speed circuit breakers have been used in both feeder and machine circuits of railway substations. It is the purpose of this paper to point out some of the advantages gained by placing this type of breaker in the feeder circuit and also to describe some of the more common types of feeder equipment using a well known form of high-speed circuit breaker. A brief summary of the breaker characteristics is given, together with the results of short circuit tests made on 600-volt reclosing feeders employing this type of breaker. The reclosing action is ordinarily obtained by means of a relay which, in conjunction with a load indicating resistor, measures the resistance of the external circuit. The action of this relay is purposely delayed, after the opening of the breaker, in order to permit feeder conditions to reach a stable value and particularly to enable all transient and counter e. m. f. effects to disappear before the reclosing devices are given control. The latter effects usually disappear within a few seconds of opening the breaker on the usual type of railway circuits. In a majority of cases a time delay of 10 to 30 seconds (after the opening of the breaker) elapses before the reclosing devices are given the control of the breaker. After this time delay has expired and load conditions have reached the desired value the circuit breaker is reclosed."
"Use of radio for guiding airplanes along fixed airings during fog or other conditions of low visibility is the principal topic of this paper. A directive radio beacon system is described together with a receiving system which gives simple and direct visual indications of the location of the airplane. Methods of air navigation on other than established courses are also discussed as well as simple radio communication between plane and ground."
"Attention is called to the practical importance of water in all insulators and especially to the extreme electrical sensitivity to moisture of textiles as a class. Significant amounts of electrolytic impurities occur in many insulators. In textiles in the presence of moisture such impurities are responsible for very conspicuous features of electrical behavior. Data are given showing their effect on the insulation resistance of cotton and silk. The insulation resistance of textile fibers in moist air rises greatly with duration of d-c. voltage, accompanied by many evidences of electrolysis of aqueous solutions of impurities in the textile. The instantaneous insulation resistance of fibers decreases with increase of the measuring voltage as previously shown by Evershed. However, this fact does not necessarily support his idea of kinetic redistribution of water in textiles, as this behavior is also compatible with the nature of electrolytic conducttion. Electrolytic impurities may be washed out of textiles and substantial practical improvements effected thereby. The increase of resistance is of the order of 50 times. Fibers are classified according to their electrical behavior in a manner which is also in harmony with their chemistry as follows; (1) Animal fibers. These are of protein nature and are characterized by high moisture content at ordinary humidities and by great electrical sensitivity to further increments of moisture, yet possess excellent insulating properties under usual atmospheric conditions. (2) Vegetable fibers."
"This paper outlines methods by which silk and cotton insulation can be purified and improved. It gives the results of tests on the insulation characteristics of these materials before and after purification and explains the testing procedures. One of the findings is that the purified cotton may be substituted for ordinary commercial silk."
"The function of a broad-band wave filter of the iterative ladder type in the attenuation band, and outside the attenuation band can be explained very simply when expressed in terms of two characteristic vectors Za and Zb. Drawing the diagram of these vectors, it becomes obvious that the angle between them is the phase shift of the filter and that the natural logarithm of the ratio of their magnitudes is the attenuation. The diagram also shows very plainly the relationship between a mid-series and a mid-shunt structure, and the equations for such filters can be derived in a very simple manner from the geometry of one vector triangle. It is hoped that this simplified presentation of types of filters which are so extensively used in radio, acoustical, and in mechanical engineering will be helpful in understanding their physical meaning."
"After a brief description of the construction and connections of the condenser motor the necessity of varying the capacitance is discussed, and the performance at start and under load is considered. Locus diagrams illustrating the operating performance in detail are given, followed by a more detailed discussion of starting torque. The Appendix gives the mathematical derivation of many of the formulas discussed."
"A fundamental theory of the motor and capacitor is given partly by the algebraic method and partly by graphical method. The variables in the design of a complete capacitor motor unit for any desired performance are discussed. A few examples of unbalanced phases and performance are given. The suitability for various classes of service is discussed briefly."
"The paper presents an accurate theory of the split phase motor, both as regards starting and running performance. The general equations for an unbalanced two-phase motor are first derived, and the results are then applied to the special case of the capacitor motor. Evidence of the validity of the theory is given in the form of curves, comparing test results with calculations. The principal factors affecting practical capacitor motor design are discussed, and finally the performance characteristics of the motor are compared with those of repulsion-start induction motors. It is concluded that the capacitor motor has important advantages, which will justify its extensive use. The complete derivation of the theory is given in an appendix."
"This paper considers the common types of polyphase induction motors suitable for starting at full voltage. The running and starting characteristics of these types are considered as well as the influence of the permissible starting current values upon these characteristics. No attempt is made to describe or consider special types designed to obtain low starting currents by the use of wound rotors, centrifugal switches, or other moving parts."
"A detailed method of calculating the no-load core losses of induction motors is presented whereby each loss component is estimated separately. There is included a discussion of extra losses due to imperfection in workmanship. Calculated and test results on a few commercial machines are given as an indication of the reliability of this method."
"The A. I. E. E. Standards have provided high-potential test values as a means of establishing a standard basis of design and construction of insulation. Many purchasers test equipment after installation before placing it in service to be sure that the connections and equipment are in a safe condition for service. It is recommended that a Standard Test Voltage be established that may be used under these conditions. It also seems to be advisable that suitable rules should be set up governing test voltages that should be used in a maintenance program. Periodic observations of the insulation resistance are suggested as substitute or supplemental tests. If there is a general desire that rules of this sort should be made, it is proper that the Institute should enter this new field of standardization."
"The paper discusses the operating characteristics of large commutators. It is pointed out that many cases of blackened and burned bars are caused initially by a slight roughness which causes irregular commutation and a slight sparking which when once started gradually becomes worse. The requirements of the surface of a high-speed commutator are discussed, showing that radial variations of the order of one ten-thousandth of an inch between adjacent bars may give serious trouble. Some causes of roughness are discussed, showing that temperature is a major factor, but that redesigning the commutator to reduce the temperature does not necessarily cure the trouble, and may actually give poorer performance. Some methods of commutator testing are described with typical records showing the performance of various types of construction. The question of safe temperature limits is then discussed. It is maintained that the question of the permissible temperature limits is entirely unlike that of insulated windings, since the materials used are not injured by temperatures considerably above the present limits. The permissible limit of a commutator is determined by its mechanical construction. Low temperature limits may lead to illogical designs, since large heat dissipating surfaces are required which may give higher stresses and larger expansion effects, which may be more harmful than higher temperatures. A temperature limit based on operating characteristics would be more satisfactory."

"When subject to transient voltage excitation, local concentration of voltage takes place in an ordinary transformer in which the capacitance charging current of the coils to ground is supplied through the winding, or the ratio of inductance and capacitance of the various parts throughout the winding is not constant. Calculations and tests of voltage distribution in the winding, caused by the impact of (a) damped high-frequency oscillations, and (b) unidirectional traveling waves, are given. In order to make the analysis clearer, the transformer winding is considered as a network of inductances and capacitances, and this term ``network'' is used throughout the paper. Certain simplified and typical networks are considered. Transformers having one terminal grounded, such as are used in three-phase star connection, particularly in high voltage systems, are frequently built with the insulation graded to other windings and ground, in the order of the normal frequency voltage stress. The danger of such a practise is shown in power transformers which are subject to transient overvoltage, since voltage oscillation in the winding may raise the voltage to ground at intermediate points above the terminal voltage, unless the design of the winding eliminates oscillation. The theoretical and experimental data given show that the distribution and magnitude of voltage stresses existing during recognized standard insulation tests are essentially different from stresses created by transient voltages. This permits the construction of transformers that would satisfactorily pass standard insulation tests but at the same time would not be suitable for average service."
"This paper shows how the Heaviside operational methods may be applied to determine the transient currents that are produced in synchronous and induction machines by some sudden alteration of their electric circuits. The observed and computed values of the transient currents have been plotted for a number of cases. There is also a table giving the names of the principal investigators who have written on this subject and the methods of analysis that they have employed."
"Starting with the basic assumption of no saturation or hysteresis, and with distribution of armature phase m. m. f. effectively sinusoidal as far as regards phenomena dependent upon rotor position, general formulas are developed for current, voltage, power, and torque under steady and transient load conditions. Special detailed formulas are also developed which permit the determination of current and torque on three-phase short circuit, during starting, and when only small deviations from an average operating angle are involved. In addition, new and more accurate equivalent circuits are developed for synchronous and asynchronous machines operating in parallel, and the domain of validity of such circuits is established. Throughout, the treatment has been generalized to include salient poles and an arbitrary number of rotor circuits. The analysis is thus adapted to machines equipped with field pole collars, or with amortisseur windings of any arbitrary construction. It is proposed to continue the analysis in a subsequent paper."
"This paper presents a brief outline of the development and application of magnetic analysis for the nondestructive testing of iron and steel and their products. The subject is treated under the following headings: Historical development, Experimental results, Practical commercial applications, and Conclusion."
"This paper outlines some important flow-measurement problems and points out the character of electrical apparatus that may be used with other equipment for measuring flow."
"The electromagnetic oscillograph has proved to be a useful instrument for obtaining recorded measurements of non-electrical quantities. The problems of application involve the translation of mechanical phenomena into electrical changes which are proportional. Several typical applications are described showing how motion, time, stress, pressure, etc., are measured."
"The objections to unnecessary noises in electrical apparatus are becoming so insistent that the manufacturers are making every effort to reduce them. In order to attack the problem intelligently it is first necessary to determine the amplitude and frequency of the components of the complex sounds. The first requirement then is a simple portable sound analyzer. Descriptions are given of two resonance types which have been developed. There is included also a short discussion of the laws of sound variation and sound units. Finally there are discussed various applications of the sound analyzer to the study of noises in gears, motors, generators, induction regulators, loud speakers, vacuum sweepers, and the like."
"Electrical and magnetic aids to navigation by water and air are outlined in this paper. The principal subjects discussed are the earth inductor compass, the radio compass, the radio beacon, submarine signals, depth finders, distance finders, channel-marking signals, fog-penetrating lights, height indicators for aircraft, etc. A bibliography is included."
"The paper, in addition to surveying the field of application of ``telemetering'' and relating it to ``supervisory control,'' presents several innovations in the types of ``telemeters'' available. Operating requirements and channels available for the transmission of readings are discussed, and an installation of the varying frequency type of telemeter on the Montaup Electric Company's System is described."
"The importance of measuring an electric system load at any distance from that load is emphasized. The use of thermal wattmeters in conjunction with thermal couples is suggested. Time of response of such devices is discussed; temperatures attained are also discussed. Characteristics of circuits for transmitting the thermal e. m. f. from the load to the point of measurement are discussed in detail. A list of users together with data pertaining to the measurement-transmitting circuits is given."
"This paper is presented for the purpose of describing a new method of compensation, by the use of which the ratio and phase-angle errors of current transformers are materially reduced. There are several methods by which the ratio and phase-angle errors of current transformers may be reduced. The following are those which are most commonly used: 1. By changing the number of secondary turns, which reduces ratio errors only. This method is universally used and operates satisfactorily under various conditions of burden, frequency, etc. 2. By the use of a larger number of ampere-turns, a large cross-section of core, or both. An increase in either one of these factors improves the accuracy characteristics of the transformer under the different conditions of burden, frequency, or secondary current. 3. By the use of a high-permeability low-loss steel, which improves the transformer characteristics for moderate values of secondary burdens. The errors increase rapidly under overload conditions. 4. By the use of the two-stage type transformer, which operates satisfactorily under the various conditions of burden and frequency. Slightly special equipment is required, however, for power or energy measurements. 5. By the use of compensating shunts across the primary or secondary windings of the transformer. This method operates satisfactorily only under fixed conditions of burden, frequency, etc. 6. By a new method, in which the secondary turns enclose a section of the magnetic circuit and a short-circuited band encircles the same section."
"The potentiometer principle is well understood. Its application to the determination of the ratio and phase angle accuracy of potential transformers is not new, but has been limited in unshielded form to about 66 kv. and in shielded form to about 33 kv. The paper describes a shielded potentiometer for 132 kv. which is designed for ultimate extension to 220 kv."
"A recently developed precision voltage regulator for use with alternating current is described. It will maintain its output voltage constant to within 0.03 per cent over an input voltage range of 10 per cent and a load range of from zero to full load. This regulation is accomplished by means of a small transformer inserted in one of the lines which boosts or bucks the impressed voltage by the required amount. The transformer is controlled by a vacuum tube circuit acting through an inductance bridge."
"Tables of Bessel functions of zero and higher orders are given, for use in problems of skin effect and proximity effect in conductors carrying alternating currents. Formulas for deriving numerical values of the functions are given, in the form of series for large and for small values of the argument. The series are complete with their general terms. The application of the tables to the calculation of the skin effect resistance ratio of an isolated tubular conductor is described and an example is given."
"A method for determining the most economical proportions for transformers is suggested. The method takes into account the densities of flux and of current in addition to the dimensions taken into account in previous discussions of this problem. Various shapes of transformers are considered."
"In this paper are described recent developments in telephone construction practises which react to preserve the integrity of the sheath of lead covered cable, thus decreasing insulation troubles due to moisture seeping through armor breaks and warding off serious service interruptions."
"The US Department of Commerce under the Air Commerce Act is responsible for the installation, operation, and maintenance of the national airways. The lighting facilities along the airways consist of revolving beacons at 10-mi. intervals and intermediate landing fields approximately every 30 mi. At the intermediate landing fields, in addition to the revolving beacon there are provided an illuminated wind cone, boundary, approach, and obstruction lights. The Department of Commerce is also responsible for the rating of airports, although, their establishment, maintenance, and operation are matters of municipal or private concern. The rating of an airport is a measure of the facilities available. A preferred rating for lighting facilities requires the installation of an airport beacon to locate the airport from distant points, an illuminated wind direction inidicator, white or yellow lights marking the boundary of the landing area, red lights on all obstructions, green range lights marking approaches, floodlighted hangars or other buildings as a measure of altitude and to illuminate identifying markings, a searchlight for measuring ceiling height and suitable floodlighting for the landing area. In view of the regulating authority vested in the Department of Commerce, the practise in lighting airways and airports follows very closely established standards. The floodlighting of the landing area proper offers the greatest opportunity for original thought and ideas. There have developed two schools of opinion regarding the fundamentals of field floodlighting systems. The present lighting facilities are found very satisfactory during fair weather but the problem of aiding the flier during fog still faces the engineer and research scientist as a problem."
"In large turbine generators there is no convenient method for determining the iron losses under load. It is the purpose of this paper to show, analytically, the factors influencing the change in iron loss with load. While very definite results are given for a simplified machine, it is not recommnended at this time that any change be made in the A. I. E. E. Standards for computing load loss, because there is miuch to be done before the work can be considered complete. This particular problem is typical of many which are entirely suitable for purely analytical study, and should furnish very desirable able work for investigators who do not have access to large machines for extensive tests, but who desire to carry on studies related to this type of apparatus. This, as well as similar loss problems, can be studied much more readily by theoretical work and model tests, than from measuring the total losses of an entire machine, because the value sought is never a predominant proportion of the total value measured; and even if satisfactory results be obtained on a particular machine, they are not generally applicable to all such apparatus. In this article, it is shown that on the basis of the flux distributions, the machines can be most conveniently divided into end zones, which present three dimensional problems and a large central zone, which presents only two dimensional problems."
"This paper presents a new general purpose type of hot cathode oscillograph, which employs a new electrostatic method of focusing the beam. This oscillograph will operate at any beam potential from 500 to 20,000 volts or more, and at any gas pressure below 30 microns. High photographic sensitivity at medium voltages is attained by the use of a high intensity beam. A portable form of the oscillograph for recording lightning surges on transmission lines is described, together with circuits by means of which the lightning surge automatically starts the beam in from ½ to ¼ microseconds after the surge voltage begins to rise from zero. This oscillograph was put into operation on one of the 140-kv. transmission lines of the Consumers Power Company of Jackson, Michigan, on August 27, 1928."
"This paper considers the use of fuses on insulator strings of high-voltage overhead conductors, to interrupt the arc at times of flashover before the line relays operate to disconnect the circuit. Consideration is first given to the original development of this idea, in which a fuse was connected between the line conductor and an arcing ring, attached to the second insulator unit. When an excessive voltage occurs on the conductor to ground, there is a flash between a two-pronged horn on the top insulator unit and the ring. The circuit is completed through the fuse, which immediately opens, breaking the arc. Further consideration is given to c later development of the principle, in which two expulsion type fuses replace the two-pronged horn at the top of the insulator string and the arcing ring is placed at the conductor end of the string. Data are presented from tests and from experience on about 100 mi. of 66,000-volt circuit, of the Union Gas and Electric Company, Cincinnati, Ohio."
"This paper describes briefly the operating experience and problems which have resulted from the installation of a four-wire, 120/208-volt secondary network system with combined light and power mains. The problems with reference to network equipment, voltage regulation, and operation of consumers' equipment are stated with their subsequent solution. The results obtained from fifteen months operation of this system indicate that, with reasonable care in layout and selection of equipment, no operating problems of major importance will be met."
"This paper describes elaborate and severe field tests made on high-speed excitation equipment used with a 5385-kv-a. turbo generator. Complete oscillograms and curves showing the performance of this equipment are included together with a discussion of the results obtained."
"The Cincinnati Street Railway Company has, within the past few months, completed the rehabilitation of its entire power system. The system now consists of 19 full automatic synchronous converter substations upon which has been superimposed a complete system of supervisory control and remote metering. Papers have been presented by Frank W. Peters and Harley L. Swift covering the details of this installation. (See bibliography.) This paper discusses the economic factors involved in the selection of equipment and the design of the system. Part I points out that the most important economic consideration is service and presents a method for evaluating this factor. Part II discusses the design of feeder circuits with particular reference to the limitations of Kelvin's Law. Part III discusses system design with reference to the economics involved in the location of substations, and in the selection of control equipment. A general method for conducting extensive system studies is implied. Part IV discusses system load shifting characteristics and Part V points out the advantages of supervisory control."
"Two automatic mercury-vapor rectifier substations having 8000-kw. 5000-ampere, 600-volt rectifiers are described in this paper. These rectifiers are the largest installed in this country. The reasons for the selection of this type of converting equipment instead of the rotary converter are enumerated. Information is given on the auxiliary apparatus and the control arrangement."
"Oscillographs developed for recording transient phenomena are described which obtain automatically records of amiplitude, wave form, frequency, duration, and time of any electrical disturbance for which they are adapted. Two instruments are described for recording very short or very long transients; these may be used in combination. At power frequencies satisfactory records may be made on film or sensitized paper with a two-watt lamp. The instruments and their performance are illustrated by photographs and oscillograms."
"This paper describes a new development in connection with bushing type current-transformer metering circuits. While this development utilizes the two-stage principle and has the same order of accuracy as that of two-stage current transformers, it is different from the conventional two-stage current transformers in that it does not require two-stage wattmeters and watthour meters, but may be used with any wattmeter or watthour meter. The principle and connections of the transformer are explained, and performance curves of a typical unit are given."
"A portable impulse generator delivering 400 kv. has been constructed. A cathode ray oscillograph of the cold cathode type has been so connected that impulses incoming over the transmission line to which it is connected will initiate the oscillograph. The results of studies on a 5.77-mi. section of a 66-kv. line of the Turners Falls Power Company are given. Impulses of definite forms are applied to the line. The theory of traveling waves is being checked experimentally, demonstrating the existence and magnitude of reflections, both for open ended lines and for lines closed through gaps or a combination of inductance and capacity. A simple description of the theory is given. Some preliminary results are given for attenuation obtained by successive reflections from either end of the line. The reduction of the incoming waves by an oxide film lightning arrester is given, the affected wave in one case having a front of six microseconds and in another case a front of 0.5 microseconds. Further work to be done includes the effect of traveling waves on choke coils, transformers, and ground wires. Additional work is to be done to determine the laws governing attenuation."
"This paper presents in brief review the development of the automatic network system in the seven years since its introduction. It covers the interesting features of design found in the different systems, the changes that have been made in the design of the apparatus as a result of experience, some of the problems that have been faced in the application of the system, and finally the lines along which thought is now being directed in the future development of the system."
"The object of this paper is to present a description of the Dallas (Texas) underground network system. This system is of interest since it is directly opposed to the general trend of furnishing non-standard voltages in underground systems. The reasons for its selection and its advantages over the three-phase four-wire system are presented. A brief description of the installation of equipment in vaults and manholes is given. Another feature of this system is the use of standard reactance transformers together with an external reactor, shunted by a fuse, for purposes of overload protection to the transformers. In addition to the regular network this system has a single-wire manhole and vault lighting network which is also used as a control wire for turning on and off multiple street lamps. Another feature of this system is a complete underground telephone system with a telephone outlet in each manhole and transformer vault. This telephone system is also connected to float switches in transformer vaults which automatically notify the trouble office in the event of high water in a transformer vault. The routine tests made in connection with the operation of the network system are described and the method of locating primary faults is given in detail. Complete records are kept of the installation of conduit and cable. Photographic records of construction, operation, and cable failures, etc., are also kept. The record of this network system both as to efficiency and as to continuity of service is excellent."
"The experience of the Alabama Power Company with the reclosing of high-voltage circuits is described, this covering numerous installations on 22-, 44-, and 110-kv. circuits. No definite reclosing cycles are recommended but instead this paper deals with various typical applications of high-voltage reclosing oil circuit breakers on the Alabama Power Company system."
"An appreciable saving may be made in construction of overhead distribution systems by the use of bare conductors in the place of weatherproof conductors. The reliability of the system will be considerably increased with lower maintenance and operation costs. Bare conductors have practically unlimited life and when removed can be reinstalled as new wire resulting in a reduction of depreciation. This paper outlines the advantages of using bare wires and gives also advantages of medium-hard-drawn as compared with annealed conductors."
"Interconnected electric service in the Southwest has kept pace with the country as a whole. Eight states are now connected by a continuous transmission system, operated at a voltage of 60,000 volts or more. This system extends 720 mi. from East to West and 810 mi. from North to South. A description of the system is given in this paper."
"This paper briefly reviews the history of electricity as motive power for oil pipe line operation and notes some of the reasons for, and the results of, its rapid development in the Southwest. Some attention is paid to the method of serving these loads from transmission lines and the tendency of modern pipe line practise is shown. The last five years have seen rapid advances in the methods of underground transportation of petroleum and the paper reviews some of the present tendencies in design of the modern oil pipe line station."
"Study of transformers has been under way for some time to coordinate the strength of transformers and transmission line insulation under lightning conditions. This study has taken two forms: first, the transient dielectric strength of the line end of the winding and second, the distribution of transient voltages and therefore the stress caused by them throughout the winding. Theoretical studies and spark-gap tests of transient voltage distribution in transformer windings have been previously published by the Institute. Since then an extensive study of transient voltage phenomena has been made by the cathode ray oscillograph on power transformers connected to a short transmission line and subjected to artificial lightning waves sent along the line. The effects of the transmission line, concentrated inductance, and transformer entrance bushings on traveling waves were studied, as well as the effect of traveling waves of various service conditions in producing internal oscillations in ordinary transformers. The non-resonating transformer was stutdied under similar conditions. A striking agreement between the oscillographic records and theoretical conclusions previously published was found, sufficient to establish beyond any doubt the following conclusions: 1. Very high voltage oscillations occur throughout the entire winding of even a grounded neutral transformer. 2. Points of the winding near the grounded neutral may rise to 95 per cent of the crest voltage of a very short traveling wave (three microseconds long). 3. Entrance bushings have a negligible effect on the shape of the incoming traveling wave. 4."
"This paper discusses methods of lighting airports and airways and describes various types of lamps and equipment used for this purpose. In the information on airport illumination are included beacons, obstruction lights, boundary lights, illuminated wind direction indicators, field and building flood lights, signal lights, and ceiling illumination. The portion on airway lighting covers principal and intermediate beacons and emergency field lighting. An extensive bibliography is included."
"This paper describes the main electrical features of the new works recently constructed for additional water supply for Kansas City, Missouri. It enumerates the chief features of the power contract under which the city is purchasing its power. It states the type and capacities of the major electrical equipment and touches briefly on the wiring and lighting systems. It does not treat the efficiencies or the costs of the equipment."
"There have been presented before the Institute numerous papers describing various technical and apparatus developments of value in providing long distance telephone service. Several papers have also appeared covering specific transmission or operating problems or dealing with the advance planning of the telephone plant. Feeling that it might be of interest, particularly to the young engineering graduates, the writers have prepared this over-all sketch of the general problem of actually providing year by year the extensions and additions to a comprehensive network of communication channels necessary to keep pace with a growing public demand for long distance service. Since the writers are most familiar with the area served by the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company the discussion will be restricted to that territory."
"A brief résumé of the nature of telephonic signals is given, showing how the qualities of wave composition which distinguish signals from other electrical waves set the requirements on networks and provide a basis for their design. The principal functions of wave filters, equalizers, telephone transformers, line balancing networks, and artificial lines are outlined. In order that these networks may be used in conjunction with other apparatus in the telephone system they must provide efficient transmission, low distortion, good impedance balance, stoppage of longitudinal currents, stable characteristics with current variations, low external coupling, and low reflection coefficient. In addition to these requirements the network must not cross-talk into associated circuits and must have desirable impedance characteristics in the attenuation range of frequencies as well as throughout the transmission range. An illustration of the use of transmission networks in a typical three-channel carrier telephone system is given describing the functions of the line filter sets, the directional filter sets, band filters, and equalizers. Some of the engineering limitations on the design and construction of networks are discussed."
"Networks of telephone circuits which are extensively used in the transmission of programs to broadcasting stations are described in this paper. Certain stages in the development of these networks are considered and the general requirements for satisfactory transmission at the present time are enumerated. The arrangements of the networks as well as the procedures used in setting up and maintaining them are discussed."
"The purpose of this paper is to describe and analyze the origin and formation of traveling waves on a transmission line induced by lightning discharges, and to investigate their behavior at a transition point where there is an abrupt change of circuit constants. Some of the ground covered is necessarily old and well known, but has been included in the interests of completeness and continuity of treatment. The effect of the rate of cloud discharge and the initial distribution of bound charge on the shape and amplitudes of the traveling waves is brought out. General methods of analysis are formulated and illustrated by practical cases. The assumptions and approximations involved are discussed, and the probable direction of their deviation from fact indicated. Exact and approximate mathematical expressions are derived, and therefrom graphical and tabular methods are outlined. For all of the examples given, line attenuation and distortion are neglected and only the first reflection from a transition point is considered."

"The New York 60-cycle system is operating with connections giving parallel paths between generating units only at the load. High values of reactance result for synchronizing circuits between the several generating units, but the usual values are present in the main energy channels between generators and load. Connections are contrasted with two common types of metropolitan power systems; i. e., the \"close linked\" and \"loose linked\" systems, and are shown supplemental to multiple-feed network distribution, as the principle of using separate multiple feeds from independent generators connected in parallel only at the load extends the network distribution system to the generating stations. In completely networked distribution, the 120/208-volt mains acting as a short-circuit-proof bus, supply the only synchronizing paths between generators. Substation busses serving radial load are substituted where complete networks do not exist. Calculations, tests, and operating experience indicate synchronizing power sufficient to give stability to all elements of the system not directly affected by a fault. Some advantages derived are: Increased reliability of generating sources, lower interrupting duties on circuit breakers, and reduction in service voltage disturbance."
"This paper describes the results of calculations made for operating the Hell Gate and Sherman Creek generating stations of the United Electric Light and Power Company synchronized at the load. After reducing the numerous branches of the system to a simpler equivalent, calculations were made on the operation of an isolated section. These calculations indicated ample static stability and transient stability under fault conditions representing the maximum which might normally be expected. Other calculations were made indicating that the entire system, with synchronizing paths completed through the substation low-voltage busses would likewise meet the required stability conditions. Tentative system design factors, based on the calculations and experience to date, are suggested as a guidle to system planning. This paper shows a practical application of the theories and principles developed in the studies of transmission stability. In the present case a somewhat different object was in view inasmuch as it was desired to substantiate ideas as to the feasibility of the plan of synchronizing at the load, rather than to obtain numerical limits."
"System test results, operating connections, and experience with the New York City system synchronized at the load are given. Data obtained by test are presented, showing the behavior of the system when generators are operated synchronized only through a low-voltage a-c. secondary network. The adaption of this method of connections to the New York City 60-cycle system, including system layout, station and feeder arrangement, and automatic recording apparatus is described. Experience with these connections has demonstrated that stable performance of prime movers is obtained, load and wattless control is simplified, oil circuit breaker duty is reduced, and voltage fluctuation at customer's service during system disturbances is materially decreased."
"The Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Boston has adopted a policy of numerous relatively small automatic a-c. substations located at the various individual load centers, this policy being enhanced by the development of a new method of automatic control and by the standardization of the station design. The rating of a substation is based on the sum of three specially designed transformers each having an inherent 50 per cent overload capacity. Thus, the maximum load is normally carried by the three units operating at their nominal 100 per cent rating, but in emergencies the load can be handled by two banks, the transformer out of service, representing only 33 per cent of the station capacity instead of 60 per cent as in the usual case. The automatic control consists essentially of load-current relays which switch in or out the follow-up transformers as needed. This operating point for maximum station efficiency equals √2 × core losses per bank/copper losses. Serious trouble on any bank will bring in the succeeding transformer. Each transformer has its own sequence switch so that it may be made leading, follow-up, second following, or manual, irrespective of the set-up for the remaining units. The simplicity of this control equipment is particularly interesting; in fact only the current control and one auxiliary relay are directly chargeable to the automatic control. The circuits and apparatus have several special features promoting safety and reliability."
"Certain pertinent history of the recent development in the field of power generation is given in graphic form. The problem of rehabilitation of steam power plants is shown to arise from the great rapidity of this development. While no simple rule can be given to indicate when, if at all, rehabilitation ts justifiable, certain guiding criteria which may serve as aids in analysis are stated. These are followed by brief accounts of the various methods available for rehabilitating plants to different extents. Finally, it is suggested that the possibility of later rehabilitation be taken into account when designing plants for systems in which history or argument indicate that such action is to be expected."
"This paper considers in a general way the application of automatic induction voltage regulators to network distribution systems. A discussion is given of the usual methods of applying both single-and three-phase induction regulators and their relative merits are considered. The latter part of the paper takes up various methods that may be used to obtain successful operation when automatic induction regulators are operated on parallel feeders."
"The Mexican Railway Company, Ltd., locally known as Ferrocarril Mexicano, was the first railway built in Mexico, having been opened to traffic January 1, 1873. The main line runs between Mexico City and Vera Cruz and is 264 mi. in length. There are six branch lines which increase the route miles to a total of 482. The most difficult portion of the line consists of 19 mi. of 4.7 per cent grade between Encinar and Boca del Monte where the table-land is reached. In 1921, when the road was returned to its owners, following five years of government operation, the property was found to be in an unsatisfactory condition, with operating expenses more than doubled, thereby increasing the operating ratio from 0.51 in 1914 to 0.79 in 1920. Higher wages and new working agreements were largely responsible and continued to become more difficult. The mountain division had about reached its maximum capacity with the existing equipment, making it necessary to consider improvements. A study of the operating costs of this section was made in 1921 from which it was apparent that the electrification of that section would readily relieve the congestion and make it possible to more than double the capacity of the line and at the same time accomplish a yearly saving of $523,000 in operating expense. The electrification was estimated to cost $2,420,000, thus indicating a return of 21 per cent on the gross investment including electric locomotives, in addition to the increased capacity and many other advantages."
"It is the purpose of this paper to present such data on the subject of contact wire wear as the electric operation of four railroads has made available. Design of overhead system and pantographs, lubrication of pantograph shoes, presence of steam locomotives under catenary, ice on contact wire, condition of roadbed, speed of trains, and amount of current collected at pantograph shoe all have a bearing on the rate of wear, the relative importance of each of these factors being a moot question. The four railroads contributing are the New York, New Haven and Hartford, the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific, the Pennsylvania, and the Illinois Central."
"This paper contains a description of one of the out-door substations of the Philadelphia-Wilmington electrification of the Pennsylvania Railroad, recently placed in service. It describes the initial installation of apparatus provided in the substation for the present suburban electrification, as well as the steps taken to accommodate the additional apparatus necessary for the through electrification when it takes place. The location and control of the substation are described as well as the types of protective apparatus utilized and the method of operation. Attention is called to certain operating necessities which control the design and location of a substation of this character. The means provided for handling the heavy apparatus into and out of a substation of this character and the facilities for handling, cleaning, and restoring oil to the different pieces of apparatus are described in some detail."
"Direct-current substations designed to meet the demands of heavy railway terminal service are described in this paper. This direct-current energy is furnished at 1500 volts from seven substations located in the Chicago district and owned and operated by the power companies. In addition to 1500-volt supply for traction purposes, alternating current at 4000/2300 volts is provided for the railway company's light, power, and signal systems. Approximately 80 per cent of conversion capacity is in synchronous converters and the remainder in mercury rectifiers. Reasons for selecting the latter units are given as well as some of the characteristic features of them. To meet the rigorous requirements as to voltage and current demands under the agreement with the railway company, the conversion units have a rating of 300 per cent load for 1 minute. The synchronous converters are of the field control type, and in order to hold the d-c. voltage to definite values for any load within the rating of the unit and to maintain the reactive current of the unit within the safe limits, there is provided, common to all the converters in a substation, a counter e. m. f. regulating set, a 4-circuit rheostat, and a voltage regulator. High-speed air breakers are used on the d-c. side of the units and all 1500-volt feeders. Another feature of interest is the use of truck mounted enclosed switch units on both the high and low tension sides of the substation."
"The telephone transmission system described here is the Master Reference System of the Bell System for the expression of transmission standards and the ratings of the transmission performance of telephone circuits. The transmitter and receiver elements of this system are reference standards for the ratings of the transmitting and receiving performance of terminal station sets. A replica of this reference system, installed in Paris, has been adopted as the Master Reference System of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephone Communication in Europe. The establishment of these two master systems provides a common reference for the telephone transmission work of the Bell System and the telephone administrations which are members of this International Advisory Committee."
"This paper describes two types of electrical analyzers which have been developed for the direct measurement of harmonic components of voltage and current on power and telephone systems. These devices are assembled mechanically in a form suitable for use either in the laboratory or in the field. Both instruments, which differ chiefly with respect to sensitivity and input circuit arrangement, employ multistage vacuum tube amplifiers and two duplicate interstage selective circuits. The power circuit analyzer is designed to measure harmonic voltages in the frequency range from 75 to 3000 cycles and over a voltage range from 0.5 millivolt to 50 volts. The telephone circuit analyzer operates over the same frequency range and measures harmonic currents as low as 0.05 microampere and voltages as small as 0.005 millivolt. Both analyzers are adapted to measure small harmonic voltages and currents in the presence of the fundamental component and other harmonics relatively large in magnitude. A number of devices are described which have been adopted for eliminating various sources of error. The paper presents in detail the characteristics of both instruments with respect to selectivity, sensitivity, linearity, balance of input with respect to ground, generation of harmonics, and susceptiveness to stray fields."
"The fundamentals of automatic synchronizing are discussed, and the requirements which must be met by the ideal synchronizer are outlined. The design and the principle of operation of two different models of a newly developed automatic synchronizer are described. The paper treats the method by which, for any frequency difference within limits of present operating practise, either model of the synchronizer will cause the closing coil of the circuit breaker to be energized in advance of synchronism, by a time equal to that required to close the circuit breaker. The closing coil of the circuit breaker is, therefore, energized when the phase displacement between the voltages of the two systems to be synchronized is such that, assuming the frequency difference between the two systems remains constant during the short time required to close the breaker, the breaker contacts will always be closed at the instant of zero voltage phase displacement. The reasons for the excellent performance of these automatic synchronizers even when applied to connect systems with very erratic frequencies are outlined. A series of tests is referred to, showing the superiority of automatic synchronizing in comparison with manual synchronizing, and the results obtained with the new synchronizer models in a generating station with propeller type waterwheels are described."
"This paper presents practical information regarding the application of high-frequency (180-cycle) induction motors with low-resistance rotors to portable electric tools. In order to compete with existing tools it became necessary to increase the rotor speed above that of 60 cycles, and 180 cycles per second was adopted as commercially practical. Several advantages are shown. There is a smaller drop in speed with this type of motor, than with the d-c. or the universal motor, and because of this, greater power is developed. The life of the cutting tools is longer due to the better speed regulation. Less weight and lower maintenance costs result from this application. Several new tools for special work are described. The desirable regulation of the frequency converter or motor generator is given as not exceeding 8 per cent."
"The paper presents the derivation from elementary principles of equations for the design of heating elements. These are then connected with Stefan's law of radiation, and also with a much-used rating curve which has given good results. The reason for the conservatism of this latter curve is shown, and a numerical example worked out for both the theoretical and empirical curves."
"An attempt is made to describe simply and clearly the basis of the temperature rating of oil-immersed transformers and the relations between the temperatures measured in service, the maximum safe output rating, and the national standard ratings. A description is given of an instrument for indicating the safe output rating of a transformer in service under any conditions of short time or continuous loading."
"The usual procedure in considering the operation of induction motors has been to neglect the effect of harmonics. Although in most instances this gives results which are sufficiently accurate, the question of how much these effects are or how much is being neglected has yet to be answered in electrical engineering literature. In this paper an attempt is made to answer this question. It is also devoted largely to a statement of results with only such explanation as space permits. The conclusions are that, with harmonics of 10 per cent or less, the harmonics produce an insignificant effect, for all types of induction motors and for all conditions of operation, except for the no-load condition. In this case, significant but not serious increases of I2X occur. Also lightly loaded induction motors may be counted on to smooth out the impressed electromotive force wave."
"Hydrogen is an excellent cooling medium for high-speed rotating electrical machinery. When it is substituted for air, a machine can be operated at a higher load with the same temperature rise and the windage loss is decreased to one-twelfth. Furthermore, since no oxidation can take place in this type of machine, the life of the insulation is increased and short circuit and corona troubles are very materially reduced. The machine is especially quiet, and it can be placed out of doors without increased expense. The first commercial application of hydrogen cooling for electrical machinery was made on a 12,500-kv-a. outdoor synchronous condenser. Another outdoor hydrogen cooled condenser designed along these lines rated 20,000 kv-a., is also in operation. Both condensers were placed in service in 1928 and their performance has been very satisfactory. This paper describes the construction of the machines and reviews the advantages and disadvantages of hydrogen cooling."
"The torque produced by a short circuit is first discussed in a general way, showing that it is pulsating in nature. The average value of torque is determined by the resistance and other energy losses but the instantaneous value rises far above the average value. The major part of this pulsating torque is produced by the change in stored magnetic energy. General equations are derived for the torque in a machine having negligible resistance and constant self-inductance of each winding which is referred to as an ``Ideal Machine.'' These equations are useful in comparing single-phase and various polyphase short circuits and for determining general tendencies. However, the numerical value of the torque is usually of most interest in salient-pole machines and here the self inductance of the armature windings is not constant. The calculation of torque from the actual inductance of the windings of a salient-pole machine is a very complicated problem. A relatively simple step by step calculation, called the ``semi-graphical method,'' is developed for calculadating the torque from the actual currents as given by an oscillogram. The effect of resistance can be included in this calculation. The mtethod holds for any variation in self inductance with rotor position provided that saturation is not a large factor in determining the change in stored magnetic energy, which seems to be true in cases thus far investigated. Short-circuit torque can be measured by an instrument described in a previous paper."
"In this paper La Place's and Poisson's equations are applied to cases of current carrying conductors in rectangular slots to show the flux distributions which obtain. The paper first treats with the general case which is a single conductor, completely surrounded by insulation, at the bottom of a slot. Next is taken up the more practical case of a slot containing two insulated conductors, one above the other, in which currents of equal magnitude are considered first to flow in the same direction, and then in opposite directions. In addition to these analyses, a few special cases are discussed. Methods are also discussed by which the flux distributions in slots containing an even number of coil sides may be obtained, or in slots the conductors of which carry currents not in time-phase. Equations are developed from which all of these fields can be calculated. A discussion is included to show the distribution of flux on the assumption that the lines go straight across the slot, and a comparison is made between the slot inductance determined mathematically from the developed equations and by the usual design formulas. In the case considered it is found that the design formulas give a value of slot inductance which is about 96 per cent of that obtained by the mathematical treatment which is within limits of engineering accuracy. An expression is developed which shows the error that may be expected in any particular case."
"Electrical measuring apparatus is shielded and guarded to protect it from the following external influences; namely, leakage currents, electrostatic fields, magnetic fields, and electromagnetic waves. Apparatus is guarded against leakage currents which may flow over or through the solid insulators on which the apparatus is supported. It is shielded against leakage currents which flow through the fluid in which the instrument is immersed. By a proper arrangement of guards and shields any apparatus can be completely protected against leakage currents. Any apparatus can be completely shielded from electrostatic fields by placing it in a metallic case. However, there may be electrostatic reactions between the apparatus and the shield, thus introducing rrors in the measuring apparatus. Shielding apparatus from magnetic fields requires that the apparatus be surrounded by a thick enclosure of magnetic material. The theory of this magnetic shielding has been developed and formulas las for producing the most satisfactory shielding are given. The shielding of an apparatus from electromagnetic waves is largely accomplished by means of eddy currents which these waves set up in the shield. The theory for the production of these eddy currents has been developed and the best location of shields is discussed. Some attention is given to the errors which may be introduced by shielding and some methods are outlined for obviating the necessity of shielding."
"The measurement of dielectric loss in high-voltage cables presents many problems that are not obvious until such measurements have actually been attempted and the results checked and analyzed. Some of these problems are not simple, and their solution is obtained only after considerable effort and research. This paper presents some of the problems that the authors have encountered in this type of work, together with the methods used for their solution. The bridge method, which is used for the measurement of dielectric loss, is described in some detail. Details of the auxiliary equipment, such as galvanometer, amplifiers, air condenser, shielding, and special methods of bringing the shielding to the proper potential are also given. If accurate results are to be had in dielectric loss measurements, the entire bridge, including cable, air condenser, and leads, must be properly shielded and the capacitance between leads and shielding should be made small. Errors of large magnitude may be introduced in the results if these precautions are not taken. It is entirely insufficient to shield the bridge and ground the shielding directly. At times shielding cables may increase the measured losses. In measuring the capacitance of the air condenser, all stray capacitance to its guard rings and to surroundings must be eliminated. The paper gives a method of accomplishing this. The voltage across the voltmeter coil of a high-voltage transformer is frequently taken as a measure of the voltage across its secondary."
"The purpose and usefulness of shielding in high-frequency measurement are outlined. General principles of electrostatic shielding are developed as applied to simple impedances and to networks of impedances, particularly to bridge networks. Practical applications of these principles to the shielding of adjustable impedances, and in the construction of actual bridge circuits are described."
"This paper presents the results of investigations made to explain the wide differences found between dielectric loss measurements made on full reel lengths of cable and on samples (10-ft. net length) removed from these reels. At least one source of such differences is found in losses occurring at the end of the cable, these losses being insignificant in the case of the full reel but amounting ing to as much as 100 per cent of the loss in the normal sample. Methods of determining, controlling, and eliminating these end losses are described."
"In electric power stations, it is often necessary to make accurate measurements of current or power when the instruments are located near to the cables carrying large alternating currents. The magnetic field produced by these currents may constitute a serious source of error in the measurements unless careful precautions are taken to guard against such disturbing effects. This paper summarizes the various principles and methods for detecting and minimizing the errors which may arise from this source. The principal methods are; (1) to so arrange the cables carrying the large currents that they produce as little stray magnetic effect as possible; (2) to use instruments of the shielded or of the astatic type; (3) to repeat readings with the instrument connections reversed; and (4) to avoid all loops in the connecting leads."
"This paper is a brief survey of the vast amount of work on magnetic shielding of instruments against steady stray fields, and allied problems, by several authors during the last fifty years.

"Tests of circuit breakers, relays, and similar devices in which current transformers have been used to step down the large currents involved to values measurable by the oscillograph, have shown peculiar errors in the records during the transient portion of the current wave. The purpose of this paper is to show that the abnormal excitation of the magnetic circuit of the current transformer required during transient conditions is the cause of these errors, and to point out how the errors may be minimized sufficiently to be negligible. Mathematical expressions are also derived to make it possible to predetermine the ability of a transformer to handle transients correctly and to guide in the design of transformers for this service."

"Three major features incorporated in the Deion circuit breaker are discussed. They are deionization at solid surfaces, the function of the static balancer, and cold electrode arcs."
"UP to the present time, the interruption of an a-c. circuit has been accomplished generally in one of two ways. The arc may be drawn between contacts located in some insulating liquid such as oil. In this case, the insulating value of the oil depreciates with each current interruption until it reaches a point where it must be renewed. On the other hand, the arc may be drawn in air with no means of extinguishing it other than lengthening it to such an extent that the generated voltage is no longer able to maintain it. For modern generating voltages, this requires arcs of great length and, for the upper range of transmission voltages, results in arc lengths which are impractical. As a result of this limitation, the oil circuit breaker has assumed a position of paramount importance on modern operating systems."
"Generators ever grow in size, transmission lines ever grow in length and voltage, but the generator voltage remains forever. So it would seem when looking back upon the enormous development of the electrical industry in the last few years. Nothing stood still; everything seems to have progressed except the generator voltage. Is there a law of nature or a constitutional amendment against the use of a generator voltage over 13,800? To be sure there are difficulties. But were there no difficulties in designing huge transformers and turbines or 220-kv. oil breakers? The study and development of insulating materials, iron and other features affecting generator design has not stood still; a great deal more is known about these features than was known twenty years ago, and more can be done withthem."

"Research is no longer considered a business philanthropy. It is no longer a side issue or hobby to be supported or neglected in the degree that money is donated by its friends. On the contrary, as recently stated by Irving Langmuir: “The leaders of industries are frequently conscious of the need of improvement in their processes and even of the need of new discoveries or inventions to extend their activities.” Research is the modern tool by which to work out commercial success in any industry."
"A recently developed precision voltage regulator for use with alternating current is described. It will maintain its output voltage constant to within 0.03 per cent over an input voltage range of 10 per cent and a load range of from zero to full load. This regulation is accomplished by means of a small transformer inserted in one of the lines which boosts or bucks the impressed voltage by the required amount. The transformer is controlled by a vacuum tube circuit acting through an inductance bridge."
"The analytical theory of simple traveling waves along parallel conductors is well known. Its disadvantage is that the relationships among the incoming, reflected, transmitted, and absorbed currents and voltages are expressed by a number of simultaneous equations difficult to grasp, from a physical point of view, in their entirety. For this reason, a graphical theory has been developed according to which all the quantities involved are represented in a so-called star diagram and the whole phenomenon conveyed to the eye quantitatively. The star diagram is then applied to the following practical cases of a simple rectangular-front non-attenuated long traveling wave: (a) Reflection from and absorption in a non-inductive terminal resistance; (b) Reflection from an open-circuited and from a short-circuited end of a line; (c) The case of critical resistance; (d) Repeated reflections from the ends of a line: (e) Discharge of a wave to the ground, directly or through a resistance; (f) Passage of a wave through the junction point of two conductors having different values of surge impedance; (g) Same as (f), only the junction provided with a series or shunted resistance, (h) Effect of a lumped series inductance or shunted capacitance in reducing the steepness of a wave front. In each case, the results agree with those deduced analytically, for example by R. Rüdenberg in his book “Elektrische Schaltvor-gänge.” Some reciprocal relationships are pointed out at the end and further problems suggested to which the star diagram may be applied."
"During the past few years, intensive research work has been carried out on some photoelectric and glow-discharge devices.

The suitability for various classes of service is discussed briefly."
"When overhead lines carry large short-circuit currents, the resulting magnetic forces on the conductors are such as to cause the cables to be repelled to greater distances than the usual spacings. The elementary principles involved are stated. A single-phase short circuit is shown to be the one producing the greatest movements. A theoretical calculation of the forces and actual experience showed the necessity of making tests to study the problem. A description of the tests indicates how photographic records of the movements of relatively large cables were obtained. The results of over 330 tests are shown by pictures and curves. The effects of a variation in each of the five principal variables, cable size, span lengthy spacing, tension and current are discussed. A mathematical expression is derived by means of which the maximum movement of conductors in a horizontal plane can be determined approximately. It has been found possible to set up a miniature test with small wire that very closely duplicates to a small scale the movements of a larger conductor. The results indicate that it is necessary for moderately large systems to take account of these short-circuit forces in the design of their overhead systems. There is a large field for research on this subject and more work should be done."

"For almost seven years, the engineers of America have been endeavoring to establish a National Hydraulic Research Laboratory. The Bill known as Senate Bill 1710 authorizes “the establishment of a national hydraulic laboratory in the Bureau of Standards of the Department of Commerce and the construction of buildings therefor” and was introduced by Senator Joseph Randell of Louisiana. It went before the House of Representatives and thence was referred to the Committee on Rivers and Harbors, which has consistently refused to take action upon it. Many of our noted engineers have testified in favor of the bill and many others have submitted written statements of endorsement; among the latter is President-Elect Herbert Hoover's. The principal opposition appears to be with General Edgar Jadwin, Chief of Engineers, U. S. A.; by the hearings it is disclosed that this attitude is based upon an apparent desire that the Chief of Engineers maintain exclusive control of the laboratory. Previous bills have given to the Chief of Engineers authority to conduct all research investigations and to take such action as he might deem necessary in the solution of flood control. The S. 1710 would give the Corps of Engineers a third interest in the control of the hydraulic laboratory established in the Bureau of Standards. Not only has the bill been passed by the Senate, but it already has the approval of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget as in no way conflicting with the President's financial policy. In the event that it is reported out by the Rivers and Harbors it has been assured right of way by the leaders of the House. As a distinct step forward in the engineering research activities of our government it is of great importance, watched by all engineers throughout the country as a demonstration of whether an officer of the U. S. A. who is not a member of Congress will be permitted to dictate a national engineering policy to Congress and the nation by his domination of one of its committees."

"Morgan Brooks, Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois and Fellow of the Institute since 1913, was born in Boston March 12, 1861. After graduating from Brown University in 1881, he expressed a desire to study engineering, but was opposed by his father, a lawyer, whose ambition it was that his son follow in his footsteps. Finding his son quite determined, however, Mr. Brooks demanded a “brief” substantiating the boy's claim to a right to digress from law and study engineering, and this brief, produced by dint of much effort, was sufficiently forceful to convince his father of his earnestness of purpose and secure the coveted permission, as well as strengthen his own determination to make a success. He was graduated from Stevens Institute in 1883; his thesis on the gas engine was published in the Van Nostrand Magazine and copied in translation in Paris and Berlin. After a short engagement involving gas engine installation, he accepted an appointment with the American Bell Telephone Company in Boston for research work. In this connection, he was wire inspector for the 7000 miles of wire in the line between New York and Philadelphia, — the first commercial long distance line of copper wire to be established. He also made all necessary electrical tests on the experimental telephone copper circuit between Boston and New York which served to determine many of the early problems of long distance telephony. In 1886 he resigned from the American Bell Telephone Company to become installation engineer in Boston for the Electric Storage Battery Company. In 1887 he was made secretary-treasurer of the St. Paul (Minn.) Gas Light Company. Here his first assignment was to investigate the Westinghouse a-c. system in competition with the d-c. system of the St. Paul Edison Company. Upon Mr. Brooks' recommendation the Westinghouse system of lighting was installed in St. Paul — one of the earliest plants in western territory."
"This paper is presented for the purpose of describing a new method of compensation, by the use of which the ratio and phase-angle errors of current transformers are materially reduced. There are several similar methods now in use, but these methods possess some undesirable features which are not present in the one described in this paper. By the use of this new method, in which a portion of the secondary turns and an auxiliary short-circuited turn enclose a section of the magnetic circuit, the change in ratio and phase angle between light and full load is considerably reduced, resulting in more nearly approaching a constant ratio, and phase-angle characteristics for all values of load. In view of the demand for meter and transformer combinations which must operate satisfactorily over large ranges of current, this is a desirable feature. The overload characteristics of the current transformer are not injured by the use of this method of reducing the transformer errors. The usual insulation between the primary and secondary can readily be maintained, and the use of this compensating feature does not in any way impair the strength of the transformer to withstand over-current shocks. No changes in the physical dimension of the transformer are required by the application of this compensating method."
"In addition to surveying the field of application of “telemetering” and relating it to “supervisory control,” the paper presents several innovations in the types of “telemeters” available. Operating requirements and channels available for the transmission of readings are discussed, and an installation of the varying frequency type of telemeter on the Montaup Electric Company's System is described."
"THE two most important properties of an insulating material are high dielectric strength and long life. The close correlation with changes in dielectric loss clearly indicates that an understanding and control of the loss will point the way to longer life. The close relationship between dielectric absorption and dielectric loss has been shown experimentally,37 and in fact the familiar decaying charging current curve under continuous voltage, typical of absorption, has been shown by Tank, Bouasse37 and others to be sufficient to account for the essential characteristics of dielectric loss."
"The following method of stating some fundamental relations of the direct-current dynamo is a great time saver when analyzing a changed condition of operation."
"The paper presents an accurate theory of the split-phase motor, both as regards starting and running performance. The general equations for an unbalanced two-phase motor are first derived, and the results are then applied to the special case of the capacitor motor. Evidence of the validity of the theory is given in the form of curves, comparing test results with calculations. The principal factors affecting practical capacitor motor design are discussed, and finally the performance characteristics of the motor are compared with those of repulsion-start induction motors. It is concluded that the capacitor motor has important advantages which will justify its extensive use. The complete derivation of the theory is given in an appendix."
"STARTING with the basic assumption of no saturation or hysteresis, and with distribution of armature phase m. m. f. effectively sinusoidal so far as regards phenomena dependent upon rotor position, general formulas are developed for current, voltage, power, and torque under steady and transient load conditions. Special detailed formulas are also developed which permit the determination of current and torque on three-phase short circuit during starting, and when only small deviations from an average operating angle are involved."
"Electrical and magnetic aids to navigation by water and air are outlined in this paper. The principal subjects discussed are the earth inductor compass, the radio compass, the radio beacon, submarine signals, depth finders, distance finders, channel-marking signals, fog-penetrating lights, height indicators for aircraft, etc. A bibliography is included in the complete paper."
"The objections to unnecessary noises in electrical apparatus are becoming so insistent that the manufacturers are making every effort to reduce them. In order to attack the problem intelligently it is first necessary to determine the amplitude and frequency of the components of the complex sounds. The first requirement then is a simple portable sound analyzer. Descriptions are given of the resonance types which have been developed. There is included also a short discussion of the laws of sound variation and sound units. Finally there are discussed various applications of the sound analyzer to the study of noises in gears, motors, generators, induction regulators, loud speakers, vacuum sweepers, and the like."
"The purpose of this investigation is to give a mathematical theory of the cyclograms of corona obtained by a cathode ray oscillograph. In the case investigated a long wire of small diameter is connected to one terminal of an a-c. source; the other terminal of the source is connected to a concentric cylinder of considerable diameter, or to a metal plate at some distance from the wire. A cathode ray oscillograph with two pairs of deflecting plates, at right angles to each other, is so connected that one pair of plates causes deflections of the cathode beam proportional to the values of instantaneous voltage of the source, and the other pair of plates causes deflections proportional to the instantaneous values of the charging and loss current flowing into the wire. So long as the sinusoidal amplitude of the applied voltage is below the visual corona point, the charging current is also sinusoidal, in time quadrature with the voltage. The oscillograph record is therefore an ellipse, with the amplitudes of the voltage and the current as the principal semi-axes. When, however, the minimum ionization voltage is exceeded during a part of each alternation, the cyclogram ceases to be an ellipse, but consists of four portions per cycle, two of which correspond to the intervals of time during which the corona is extinct, and the other two when corona is present, with quite short transients in between. F. W. Peek, (A. I. E. E. TRANS., Vol. XLVI, 1927, p. 1009) published a number of such oscillograph records, with voltage amplitudes both below and above the visual critical point. In order to explain the mechanism of corona formation and the influence of the space charge upon the instantaneous critical voltage, he also produced “artificial corona,” by using two condensers in series, one of which was shunted by a sphere-gap. The purpose of the present investigation is to give a mathematical theory of the observed cyclograms, on the basis of two condensers in series, with the space charge as a fictitious dividing line. To account for the actual motion of ions and the power loss, the condenser nearest the wire is assumed to be shunted by a conductance, and to have a resistance in series. Approximate equations are derived for the current and the voltage as functions of time. For the artificial corona it is shown that the composite curve consists of arcs of two ellipses, with their principal axes along those of the cyclograms. Assuming the visual critical voltage to be known, an expression is derived for the instant of the cycle at which the corona is re-established. For the actual corona, it is shown that the cyclogram also consists of portions of two ellipses, only their principal axes are at some angles with the principal axes of the cyclogram. The theory is applied to one of Mr. Peek's records, and it is shown that both the shape of the experimental curves and the instants at which the corona is re-established check fairly well with the theory."
"Excerpts from letters of appreciation."
"Besides the copper loss and the dielectric loss, the losses occurring in single-conductor armored cables, whose sheath and armor are bonded and grounded at more than one point, are the circulating-current losses in the sheath and in the armor, and the additional iron losses in an armor of magnetic material. The circulating-current losses are due to the currents induced in the sheath and armor circuits by the fluxes linking these circuits when these circuits are closed by the bonds or grounding connections. The sheath and armor losses have been analyzed for a steel-wire armored cable, a copper-wire armored cable, a steel-tape armored cable, and a cable enclosed in an iron pipe, and have been compared with the losses occurring in a plain lead-covered cable without armor. The data used include test data and calculated values. It is shown that a steel-wire armored 350,000-cir. mil single-conductor cable with sheath and armor short-circuited by low-impedance bonds had a total loss (exclusive of dielectric losses), of 2.8 times the conductor loss, by test in a single-phase 60-cycle circuit at 4 ft. cable spacing, at 260 amperes. The corresponding loss in a similar cable without armor, with lead sheath short-circuited, was 2.4 times the conductor loss. Thus the steel-wire armored cable had an additional loss due to the armor of about 20 per cent. A steel-tape armor or an iron pipe surrounding a single-conductor cable usually introduces considerably higher losses. Under the same condition, a cable similar to the steel-wire armored one but having an armor of copper wires has a calculated total loss (exclusive of dielectric loss) of only 1.3 times the conductor loss, the armor current being 92 per cent of the conductor current. The reduction of losses due to diminished cable spacing in a single-phase circuit is shown. When the cable spacing is reduced from 10 ft. to 1 ft. the over-all losses for a steel-wire armored 350,000-cir. mil cable (exclusive of dielectric losses) are reduced about 8 per cent, while those for a similar cable with copper-wire armor drop only about 3 per cent. The relative total annual costs of a steel-wire armored cable and of a similar copper-armored cable, both cables having a conductor cross-section of 350,000 dr. mils, were compared. In view of the lower operating cost of the copper-armored cable, it was found to have a lower total annual cost than that of the steel-wire armored cable at load factors above 60 per cent, the steel-wire armor having the advantage economically at lower load factors."
"This report gives the latest data of the subcommittee on the subject of the protection of transmission lines against lightning by the use of overhead ground wires, special construction, etc. Reports of power companies are included and recommendations of the committee are submitted."
"That simplified practise will be applied on an increasing scale by industry and business in 1929 is forecast by the increasing number of requests to the division of simplified practise for its cooperation; by the increasing number of inquiries reaching it regarding the application of simplified practise to wholesaling and retailing; and by the increased recognition and support accorded completed simplification."
"The experience of the Alabama Power Company with carrier-current telephony over power lines and supervisory control is outlined in the paper. A sketch is included of the early development of these systems, and this is followed by descriptions of the systems later installed throughout the Company's territory. In an Appendix extracts are given from the general specifications for the equipment employed in the systems."
"It is shown that the flux linkages of a circuit may be changed in two very different ways — either the flux may be varied causing a voltage to be induced according to Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction, or the turns may be varied by a substitution of circuit without inducing a voltage. In the Appendix, it is mathematically shown that the flux may be changed either by transformer or cutting action, but that the presence of one or the other of these actions is dependent on the choice of reference axes. Thus, any argument to the effect that one of them in particular is a necessary part of all induction phenomena is futile. It is possible to identify in every d-c. machine the building up of flux linkages so as to generate a voltage, and the reduction of flux linkages by a substitution of circuit so as not to generate a voltage. The alternate working of these two methods for changing the flux linkages of a circuit is an essential and necessary feature of every d-c. dynamo-electric machine. General criteria are introduced for ascertaining in any given case the nature of the changes in inter-linkages which occur, and whether voltages are induced thereby. By way of application, a new restriction on the use of coefficients of inductance is pointed out, the sliding contact and homopolar machine are discussed, and finally a table has been prepared illustrating the various types of flux linkages found in familiar apparatus."
"In 1923 the “mile of standard cable” was replaced in the Bell System by a new unit for expressing telephone transmission efficiencies and levels. At that time, the generic term “transmission unit” was taken to designate this new unit, since it was considered desirable to defer the adoption of a more distinctive name until this unit had been given further consideration by others who would have use for a unit of this type. This new unit is defined by the statement that two amounts of power differ by one transmission unit when they are in the ratio of 1·1, and any two amounts of power differ by N transmission units when they are in the ratio of 10N(.1). In accordance with this, the number of transmission units corresponding to the ratio of any two powers is ten times the common logarithm of that ratio. [Originally reported in the Bell System Tech. Journal, January, 1929]."
"This paper describes an experimental attempt to separate the stray load losses of large ac turbine generators, making use of the fact that the loss in any of the various parts is proportional to the initial rate of temperature rise in that part. Comparisons are made between tests conducted with rotor structure removed and short-circuit tests."
"The A.I.E.E. Standards have provided high-potential test values as a means of establishing a standard basis of design and construction of insulation. Many purchasers test equipment after installation before placing it in service to be sure that the connections and equipment are in a safe condition for service. It is recommended that a standard test voltage be established that may be used under these conditions. It also seems to be advisable that suitable rules should be set up governing test voltages that should be used in a maintenance program. Periodic observations of the insulation resistance are suggested as substitute or supplemental tests. If there is a general desire that rules of this sort should be made, it is proper that the Institute should enter this new field of standardization."
"Many manufacturers of polyphase squirrelcage induction motors in the integral horsepower sizes have now added to their other products, a modified form of squirrelcage motor in which the starting current is reduced below that of the standard squirrelcage motor. The reduction in starting current is sufficient to warrant the power companies throughout this country to permit the starting of these motors directly across the line without the use of a starting compensator. This type of motor is now sold under a variety of trade names, such as line-start motors, auto-start motors, double-deck motors, double squirrelcage motors, high-reactance motors, etc."

"The hearings on the National Hydraulic Laboratory Bill, S.1710 were reopened January 28, at which time Col. E. M. Markham, who has recently returned from a three months inspection trip of European hydraulic laboratories, testified that he believed that any experimental work along the lines of rivers and harbors should be under the control and supervision of the engineer in charge of the work."
"Engineers and contractors interested in shipbuilding were pleased with the passage on February 6 of House of Representative Bill 11526, which provides for the construction of fifteen new 10,000-ton cruisers. This bill passed the Senate with the same provision known as the “time clause” which had been inserted in the House. It provides that construction be started on five ships every three years. The provision was opposed by President Coolidge as, for budgetary reasons, he wanted the time of construction left to the discretion of the President."

The societies with which these reciprocal arrangements have been estabhshed and are still in effect are: Institution of Electrical Engineers (Great Britain), Societe Francaise des Electriciens (France), Association Suisse des Electriciens (Switzerland), Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana (Italy), Koninklijk Instituut van Ingenieurs (Holland), Verband Deutscher Elektrotechniker E.V. (Germany), Denki Gakkwai (Japan), Norsk Elektroteknisk Forening (Norway), Elektrotechnicky Svaz Ceskoslovensky (Czechoslovakia), and The Institution of Engineers, Australia (Australia)."
"Norman Willson Storer, Manager of the Institute 1911–1914, one of its Vice-Presidents for 1914–1916 and 1921–1923, and now Consulting Railway Engineer for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company, East Pittsburgh, is a native of Orangeville, Trumbull County, Ohio. After completing work in the public schools and a preparatory course, he took a course at Ohio State University, from which he was graduated in 1891 with the degree of M. E. in E. E. He immediately joined the Westinghouse company, spending the first four months in the winding room, with work on transformer coils and field and armature coils for No. 3 single-reduction railway and special ring type d-c. generator armatures. Another four months was spent making a complete set of tests on the No. 3 railway motor and developing curves. The next three months were occupied in the drawing-room, followed by eight months in charge of new lines of a-c. generators, and synchronous and induction motors, including those exhibited at the World's Fair. In May 1893 he started in design work as first assistant to Benjamin G. Lamme, developing a line of small d-c. multipolar generators and motors, — the standard of the company for 10 years or more. He was in general charge until 1904. During this time, several complete lines of engine type generators as well as belted generators were developed and built for all classes of service. The ventilated armature windings and core were developed and applied to all machines. In 1895 laminated poles were introduced in the railway motor."
"The origin of flames from arcs is considered. Their low dielectric strength is attributed to ionization, and their rate of recovery of normal dielectric strength is computed. The large influence of temperature is brought out. Computations are given and experiments described which show how flames can be reduced by passing the arc gases through narrow channels."
"The paper presents the derivation from elementary principles of equations for the design of heating elements. These are then connected with Stefan's law of radiation, and also with a much-used rating curve which has given good results. The reason for the conservatism of this latter curve is shown, and a numerical example worked out for both the theoretical and empirical curves."
"This paper considers, in a general way, the application of automatic induction voltage regulators to network distribution systems. A discussion of the usual methods of applying both single and three-phase induction regulators is given, and their relative merits considered. The latter part of the paper takes up various methods that may be used to obtain successful operation when automatic induction regulators are operated on parallel feeders."
"To the Board of Directors: The work of the Committee this year has been; first, the revision of present and preparation of new standards; second, a survey and review of research and development made during the past year in the several fields covered by the Committee; and third, arranging for the preparation of papers for presentation before meetings of the Institute."
"To the Board of Directors: The continued rapid increase in scientific knowledge and in the diversity and complexity of the engineering applications and the engineering responsibilities, combine to make the four-year engineering program a less and less adequate preparation for effective engineering work."
"D-c. substations designed to meet the demands of heavy railway terminal service are described in this paper. This d-c energy is furnished at 1500 volts from seven substations located in the Chicago district and owned and operated by the power companies. In addition to 1500-volt supply for traction purposes, 4000/2300-volts alternating current is provided for the railway company's light, power, and signal system. Approximately 80 per cent of conversion capacity is in synchronous converters and the remainder in mercury rectifiers. Reasons for selecting the latter units are given as well as some of the characteristic features of them. To meet the rigorous requirements as to voltage and current demands under the agreement with the railway company, the conversion units have a rating of 300 per cent load for one minute. The synchronous converters are of the field-control type, and in order to hold the d-c. voltage to definite values for any load within the rating of the units, and to maintain the reactive current of the unit within the safe limits, there is provided, common to all the converters in a substation, a counter e. m. f. regulating set, a four-circuit heostat, and a voltage regulator. High-speed air breakers are used on the d-c. side of the units and all 1500-volt feeders. Another feature of interest is the use of truck-mounted enclosed switch units on both the high- and low-tension sides of the substation, This type was selected in order to eliminate certain operating hazards which exist with fixed type switching arrangements, and to provide the customary factors of accessibility and maintenance. In operating experience, the substation equipment has met all expectations, the performance of the synchronous converters and high-speed breakers being exceptional, while confidence in the mercury rectifier not lessened."
"This paper presents a discussion of the causes of radio interference from insulators on high-voltage equipment. The present methods of eliminating this kind of disturbance are explained, and the question of future design is discussed."
"A wind tunnel for testing model airplanes and their parts requires accurate control of the air velocity. This paper describes a tunnel having electric drive for producing the air movement and explains a system of control, which allows a wide range of speeds and holds the speed very constant at any set value. Either hand or automatic regulation may be employed. The hand control is used for fairly constant speed while the automatic control gives very close regulation."
"For interruption of small currents at relatively high voltages, fuses and air-break switches are most commonly employed. This paper treats of these devices which are suitable for such service as protection on the transmission lines supplying small blocks of power such as rural lines. The requirements for this service are outlined and a discussion is given of the ability of the devices to meet these requirements."
"A machine for solving differential equations in two variables is described. The equations may be linear or non-linear and may have variable or constant coefficients. The machine draws out the solution in the form of a curve, together with its derivatives. By altering the connections in various ways, a wide variety of equations may be solved with a limited number of integrating and reflexing elements."

"The volume of electric energy generated in central stations in the United States during 1928 was almost exactly 10 per cent greater than during the preceding year; and it is only a matter of months now until the yearly production in such plants will have reached a figure of 100 billion kw-hr. Hydro plants produced 40 per cent or more of the total output, a share of the total power generation larger than in any year of the last decade and due in part to better than average rainfall conditions. Coal constituted almost 90 per cent of the fuel burned for the generation of electric energy. The volume of electric output in plants other than central generating plants was about 30 per cent of central station production."
"The experience of the Alabama Power Company with the reclosing of high-voltage circuits covering numerous installations on 22-, 44-, and 110-kv. circuits is described. No definite reclosing cycles are recommended but instead, this paper deals with various typical applications of high-voltage reclosing oil circuit breakers on the Alabama Power Company system."
"To the Editor of the Journal: In the paper on Electrification of Oil Pipe Lines in the Southwest, by D. H. Levy, published in the Journal of the A. 1. E. E., June 1929, p. 434, it is stated that squirrelcage induction motors are used for driving the centrifugal pumps in all cases, and that if there were a power-factor penalty the use of static condensers would be justified in most cases."
"A technical program of diversified values and the enjoyable recreation to be found at one of California's most famed seashore resorts, are offered to those who attend the 1929 Pacific Coast Convention at the Hotel Miramar, Santa Monica, Calif., September 3 to 6."

These are Dimensions Governing Fit of Four-Pin Vacuum Tube Bases, and Arrangement of Terminals, the work of a Sectional Committee on Radio under joint sponsorship of the A. I. E. E. and the Institute of Radio Engineers. This was approved as an American Tentative Standard July 26, 1929."
"In a desire to interpret science graphically to the world at large with regard to the progress it has made during the last century, trustees of the Chicago World's Fair Centennial Celebration planned for 1933 are enlisting the aid of engineers and scientists from all parts of the United States. The Research Council Science Advisory Committee has been appointed to cooperate in formulating a basic plan to adequately portray these advances to the public, all fields of science and engineering being represented in the personnel of the committee appointed as follows: Doctor F. B. Jewett, Chairman, Doctor M. 1. Pupin, Mr. R. F. Schuchard, W. D. Ryan; Maurice Holland, Executive Secretary. These appointments were made by Doctor George K. Burgess, Chairman of the Council."
"With an aim to improving the status of the profession and uncovering new possibilities for the betterment of society, the appointment of a special committee to be known as the Committee on Engineering and Allied Technical Professions, to direct such a study under the auspices of the American Engineering Council has been announced by President Berresford."
"The first meeting of the Board of Directors of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers for the administrative year beginning August 1, was held at Institute headquarters. New York, on Tuesday, August 6,1929."
"The Fourth Conference of Secretaries of Engineering Societies met June 6–7, in the club rooms of the Western Society of Engineers, Chicago, Ill.; E. S. Nethercut, Secretary of the Western Society of Engineers, presided. A. W. Berresford, President of American Engineering Council addressed the conference, and was followed by L. W. Wallace, Executive Secretary, who explained briefly the history of American Engineering Council's participation in the Engineering Secretaries Conferences."

"Wm. A. Del Mar, Chief Engineer of the Habirshaw Cable and Wire Corporation since 1917, was born at San Francisco, California, December 15, 1880. His father, then a well-known mining engineer, retired in 1887 and took his family to Europe in order that he might indulge his hobby of historical and archaeological research. This led to the son's being brought up in an atmosphere of research, and receiving most of his education in Paris and London, in which latter city he was graduated as electrical engineer from the City and Guilds College, in 1900. During his last year at college, Mr. Del Mar assisted W. B. Duddell and Mrs. Ayetonin their classic work on the carbon arc, during the course of which the oscillograph and thermo-galvanometer were developed."
"The actions specified in the Institute's Constitution and By-laws relative to the organization of a National Nominating Committee are being taken, and the meeting of the National Nominating Committee for the nomination of officers to be voted upon at the election in the Spring of 1930 will be held between November 15 and December 15. All suggestions for the consideration of the National Nominating Committee must be received by the Secretary of the Committee at Institute Headquarters, New York, not later than November 15."
"Conservative individuals have a strong tendency to greet with loud cries and derisive laughter each new method of power generation and application which their more imaginative fellows envision. While Fulton was the jest of “Kttle old New York” the Clermont was about to accomplish the definitely “impossible.” While Edison devised amazingly clumsy devices for the use of electrical energy as reactionaries scoffed, the electrification of America was embryonically on its way. Again, Elwood Haynes and the Wrights were quite mad. Any normal person of thirty or forty years ago knew that."
"The purpose of this paper is to describe and analyze the origin and formation of traveling waves on a transmission line induced by lightning discharges, and to investigate their behavior at a transitional point where there is an abrupt change of circuit constants. Some of the ground covered is necessarily old and well-known, but has been included in the interests of completeness and continuity of treatment. The effect of the rate of cloud discharge and the initial distribution of bound charge on the shape and amplitudes of the traveling waves is brought out. General methods of analysis are formulated and illustrated by practical cases. The assumptions and approximations involved are discussed, and the probable direction of their deviation from fact indicated. Exact and approximate mathematical expressions are derived, and therefrom graphical and tabular methods are outlined. For all of the examples given, line attenuation and distortion are neglected and only the first reflection from a transition point is considered."
"DEVELOPMENT in turbine generators has been so rapid during the past four or five years that any attempt to go into a detailed description of such development would involve too voluminous a work. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to pick a few facts from a large experience of one manufacturer with the hope that these might be of interest to the profession in general."
"The torque produced by a short circuit is first discussed in a general way, showing that it is pulsating in nature. The average value of torque is determined by the resistance and other energy, losses but the instantaneous value rises jar above the average value. The major part of this pulsating torque is produced by the change in stored magnetic energy. General equations are derived for the torque in a machine having negligible resistance and constant self-inductance of each winding and which is referred to as an “Ideal Machine.” These equations are useful in comparing single-phase and various polyphase short circuits and for determining general tendencies. However, the numerical value of the torque is usually of greatest interest in salient-pole machines and here the self-inductance of the armature winding is not constant. The calculation of torque from the actual inductance of the windings of a salient-pole machine is a very complicated problem. A relatively simple step-by-step calculation, called the “semi-graphical method,” is developed for calculating the torque from the actual currents as given by an oscillogram. The effect of resistance can be included in this calculation. The method holds for any variation in self inductance with rotor position provided that saturation is not a large factor in determining the change in stored magnetic energy, which seems to be true in cases thus far investigated. Short-circuit torque can be measured by an instrument described in a previous paper.4 The torque as measured is compared with the torque as calculated by various methods. This shows that calculations based on constant self-inductance of each winding may be seriously in error, particularly if equations derived on this basis are applied to the actual currents of salient-pole machines. The “semi-graphical” method agrees reasonably well with measured values for cases tested so far."
"The object of this paper is to present a description of the underground network system in Spokane, Washington, and to describe the “operating experience and problems resulting from the installation of ring primary feeders and a four-wire 120/208-volt secondary network supplying universal service. Reasons for the choice of the system described are presented with particular reference to the use of a fuse in the secondary circuits instead of the “Network Protector” device. The general design of the primary feeders, secondary network, pilot-wire relays and fuse protection, and transformer vaults is discussed. Descriptions of all apparatus and equipment are given. A report is included covering tests made under fault conditions. The tests, which simulated actual operating conditions, indicate that the system will operate as designed. The paper concludes with a statement that no difficulties have been encountered on the system and that its operation to date has been perfect."
"To the Board of Directors: During the past year considerable progress has been made in the various branches of electrical communication engineering. The Committee on Communication submits the following report as a summary of the principal developments."
"The fundamentals of automatic synchronizing are discussed, and the requirements which must be met by the ideal synchronizer outlined. The design and principle of operation of two different models of a newly developed automatic synchronizer are described. The paper treats of the method by which, for any frequency difference within limits of present operating practise, either model of the synchronizer will cause the closing coil of the circuit breaker to be energized in advance of synchronism by a time equal to that required to close the circuit breaker. The closing coil of the circuit breaker is therefore energized when the phase displacement between the voltages of the two systems to be synchronized is such that, assuming the frequency difference between the two systems remain constant during the short time required to close the breaker, the breaker contacts will always be closed at the instant of zero voltage phase displacement. The reasons for the excellent performance of these automatic synchronizers, even when applied to connect systems with very erratic frequencies, are outlined. A series of tests is referred to, showing the superiority of automatic synchronizing in comparison with manual synchronizing, and the results obtained with the new synchronizer models in a generating station with propeller type waterwheels are described."
"It is the purpose of this paper to present such data on the subject of contact wire wear as the electric operation of four railroads has made available. Design of overhead system and pantographs, lubrication of pantograph shoes, presence of steam locomotives under catenary, ice on contact wire, condition of roadbed, speed of trains, and amount of current collected at pantograph shoe all have a bearing on the rate of wear, the relative importance of each of these factors being a moot question. The four railroads contributing are the New York, New Haven and Hartford, the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific, the Pennsylvania, and the Illinois Central."
"The usual procedure in considering the operation of induction motors has been to neglect the effect of harmonics. Although in most instances this gives results which are sufficiently accurate, the question of how much these effects are or how much is being neglected has yet to be answered in electrical engineering literature. In this paper an attempt is made to answer this question. It is also devoted largely to a statement of results with only such explanation as space permits. The conclusions are that, with harmonics of 10 per cent or less, the harmonics produce an insignificant effect, for all types of induction motors and for all conditions of operation, except for the no-load condition. In this case, significant but not serious increases of I2X occur. Also lightly loaded induction motors may be counted on to smooth out the impressed electromotive force wave."
"To the Board Directors: It is now generally recognized that progress in science and industry depends largely on research. Electrical engineering in particular must trace practically all its advances to some form of research, whether it be pure or applied. Accordingly a complete report on research in this art must necessarily involve practically all the developments in its various branches such as communication, machinery, transmission, etc. Inasmuch as this is particularly material for the Institute committees involving these branches, an attempt is made in this report merely to mention the various research bodies and their work in general, and to list briefly the outstanding achievements in engineering and physical research during the past year."
"The paper describes the technique and apparatus of sound picture recording and reproduction, with emphasis on their electrical engineering aspects. The various steps in the processes of disk and film recording as they take place in the Western Electric systems are outlined. Microphone placements, sound insulation, monitoring and mixing, and the circuits for amplifying currents and distributing them to recording machines are discussed. This is followed by a description of the disk and film recording machines. The changes which have been required in theater equipment to provide for the reproduction and projection of sound in synchronism with motion pictures are outlined. Some of the laboratory developments and studies out of which recording and reproduction methods have grown are given brief mention."
"This paper is a brief survey of the vast amount of work on magnetic shielding of instruments against steady stray fields and allied problems by several authors during the last fifty years. It contains first a simplified presentation of the method of zonal harmonic analysis by way of introduction to the mathematical theory of shielding as presented by those authors, and second, a brief summary of their theoretical inferences and experimental findings.

"When the lighting of a building proves unsatisfactory to an owner or tenant, it has become common practise to call upon the illuminating engineers of the lamp manufacturers or central station companies for prescription as to proper treatment."
"To further the adequate and proper use of light, the Westinghouse Lighting Institute was opened on May 30, 1929 at the Grand Central Palace in New York City. Occupying practically an entire city block and having an area of approximately 40,000 sq. ft., it permits a full-sized realistic setting for each lighting application. Through the center of the institute is a city street complete with its lights, traffic signals, signs, and show windows. Along each side is a variety of buildings including different types of stores, an industrial plant, a garage and Finding station and even a six-room house. Behind these actual facades are equally realistic interiors where hghting effects are demonstrated in proper surroundings. Subjects too large to include in full size, — such as, an airport or a modern office building, — are reproduced in the form of models; however, there are, full-sized sections of street railway cars, busses, and an actual automobile."
"The observance of Lights' Golden Jubilee will culminate on the twenty-first of this month with the dramatic celebration at Dearborn, Michigan. There, in the original laboratory transported with other buildings from Menlo Park, Mr. Edison will reconstruct in darkness the incandescent lamp and cause it to light. The Edison Pioneers, Mr. Henry Ford, and other distinguished friends of the inventor will be present. Plans have been made for the attendance of President Hoover, who is honorary chairman of the movement. A description of the events at Dearborn will be broadcast over an international radio hook-up."
"A noteworthy group of technical papers has been arranged for the District Meeting to be held at the Drake Hotel in Chicago, December 2 to 4. Some of the very latest developments in several lines of electrical engineering, such as distributing stations, double-winding generators, high-voltage generators, fault busses, high-pressure steam, new-type lightning arresters, air-transport communication and other subjects as shown in the list below will be covered."
"A new A. I. E. E. Standards binder has just become available which it is felt will be more effective than its predecessor from every point of view. In appearance it is similar but is considerably less bulky. At the same time it not only holds the present entire set of A. 1. E. E. Standards and Reports but there is still room for quite a number of additional pamphlets. Two steel bars are passed through punchings in the pamphlets. They are held firmly in place, yet it is much easier to insert either a whole set or an individual pamphlet. All pamphlets are now issued properly punched to fit the new binder. No clips nor rods are necessary. The price has not changed; it is $1.75 per binder."
"The call for the fall meeting of the Administrative Board of American Engineering Council has been issued by the Executive Secretary, L. W. Wallace. The meeting will be held at the Mayflower Hotel, in Washington, D. C, October 24–5."
"At a dinner at the University Club the evening of September 25, H. Hobart Porter, of Engineering Foundation signalized the beginning of the activities of the Iron Alloys Committee's work to obtain basic data on iron and its numerous combinations with other metals and certain metalloids. Notwithstanding the rapid progress made during recent years, the committee feels that knowledge of the possibilities of iron alloys and steel alloys has scarcely more than begun. Much more information is needed and to meet this need, data must be collated from laboratories of industries, governmental bureaus, universities, and other institutions of several countries. These data have already found their way into many publications and a score of languages, but to many busy men, they are not yet available, and there has been a wasteful duplication of effort and loss of time. The Iron Alloys Committee has therefore accepted as its first duty the culling from present voluminous literature results obtained by researchers, technologists, and engineers, and putting the results of this review into monographic form. The second step will be to organize and promote researches for new basic information with regard to pure iron and its combinations with other substances, — not for commercial alloys, but simply for the underlying facts essential to all industrial metallurgical laboratories."
"JOSEPH RAH, formerly chief engineer of the G & W Electric Specialty Company, is now connected with the Delta-Star Electric Company, Chicago, in a consulting capacity."
"The opening meetings of the new administrative year of the New York Section are scheduled for October 22nd and October 30th. The first meeting will be the regular general monthly meeting planned to be of interest to the entire Section although at the present time it is not possible to give details. These monthly meetings are to be continued just as in the past. And in addition, twelve group meetings are scheduled for this year. The expansion of Section Activities through the development of groups was completely outlined in the May 1929 Journal, page 410. There will be four groups actively at work this year, as follows: Power, Communication, Illumination, and Transportation. A majority of the group meetings will be held in the small auditorium on the 5th floor of the Engineering Societies Building, New York; however, there are several planned for other locations. A complete schedule follows. In all probability it will be necessary to make some changes in the dates listed during the year, but notice of such changes will appear in the JOURNAL and by special notice to New York Section members."
"Recent student meetings and related events are listed."

"P. Junkersfeld, Vice-President of the Stone and Webster Corporation, Associate Member of the Institute 1901, Fellow 1912, and Vice-President 1916–18, was born near Sadorous, Illinois, October 17, 1869. In 1895 he obtained a B. S. degree at University of Illinois, and in 1907, E. E. He has engaged in engineering and construction ever since 1895."
"This paper explains the electrical conductivity of metals in light of recent discoveries regarding the behavior of electrons. It is claimed that these discoveries have made possible a satisfactory theory of conduction. The more important discovery is that of the wave nature of the electrons. The other new discovery is known as Pauli's “exclusion principle” which states that no two electrons in a wire can have exactly the same velocity and direction of motion. In working out the theory, the statistical method of the Fermi distribution function is employed. The paper shows that the theory satisfactorily explains how there may be emissions of electrons from a hot wire in spite of the fact that very little energy is put into the electrons by raising the temperature, it explains relative resistances of metals and their alloys, the contact potential between metals, the thermoelectric effect, the Peltier effect and the change in resistance due to a magnetic field."
"This paper briefly reviews the history of the step-by-step dial telephone system in small communities of metropolitan areas, and notes some of the reasons for its recent, rapidly growing use in small towns and communities apart from metropolitan areas. The wider appreciation of improved service by the public in the last three years is noted, and requirements of the service now being rendered are discussed. The equipment is described, and the methods of operation and maintenance are given. The affect on outside plant, building design, and other incidentals is discussed, as are also the results obtained in the use of this telephone system."
"To the Board of Directors: The work of the Committee on Power Transmission and Distribution covers a wide field and may logically be divided into the following classifications: Lightning and surge problems on overhead lines Insulator design for overhead lines Design of towers and poles for overhead systems Cable development for underground systems System connections and stability factors Standardization activity Research activity."
"An equation is developed for use in meeting emergency conditions which necessitate the paralleling of transformer banks whose impedances expressed in percentage are not equal. This equation makes it possible to calculate what change should be made in the ratio of transformation of the bank with the lower percentage impedance in order to prevent its being overloaded when the total load approaches the combined capacity of the two banks. It is pointed out that such an expedient is a makeshift justifiable only when maintenance of service is the paramount consideration and efficiency is for the time being of secondary importance. When conditions arise which do justify such a temporary arrangement, the method developed in the present paper affords a simple yet accurate means of solving the problem."
"This paper gives the results of a rather comprehensive series of tests on the impulse insulation characteristics of wood, combinations of insulators and wood as used in wood-pole transmission line construction and methods of protecting wood from damage; also a brief discussion on applications of the data."
"Certain pertinent history of recent development in the field of power generation is given in graphic form. The problem of rehabilitation of steam power plants is shown to arise from the great rapidity of this development. While no simple rule can be given to indicate when, if at all, rehabilitation is justifiable, certain guiding criteria which may serve as aids in analysis are stated. These are followed by brief accounts of the various methods available for rehabilitating plants to different extents. Finally, it is suggested that the possibility of later rehabilitation be taken into account when designing plants for systems in which history or argument indicate that such action is to be expected."
"The effect of color on the temperature of oil-immersed self-cooled transformers under service conditions has been a mooted question for a great many years. Based upon the relative absorption powers of the various colors often used in painting transformer tanks, the lighter colors should give appreciably lower temperatures in hot climate sections. The results of three series of field tests conducted on actual transformers are given in the paper. The results, however, do not show the advantages for the light colors that would be expected, based solely upon the absorption powers of the colors. A method of calculation is used to check the test results, taking into consideration the various factors which apply to a transformer and do not apply to, say, a piece of metal painted and exposed to the sun's rays; i. e. the ratio of the area of the surface exposed to the sum to the total surface dissipating heat, the difference in thermal capacities, and the condition where in one case the test piece is dissipating heat as well as receiving heat from the sun, whereas in the other case it only receives heat from the sun. It is shown that when all the factors are taken into consideration, the calculated results check the observations very closely. Finally, it is shown that the selection of color for repainting transformer tanks exposed to the sunshine should be based primarilly on durability and appearance rather than upon color, since the difference in temperature resulting from a tank painted black and aluminum, or even white, will seldom exceed one or two deg. cent."
"To the Board of Directors: The Committee on Electrical Machinery has functioned under an organization similar to that of last year; that is, with subcommittees commissioned to handle all the matters of a particular type of equipment that properly belong to this committee."
"A study has been made of the reaction of transformer windings in grounded neutral systems when subjected to transient voltage surges such as exist on normally insulated lines. Measurements of the voltage distribution throughout the windings between various elements and to ground were effected by means of a cold cathode type cathode ray oscillograph and sphere-gaps. An estimate of the stresses occurring in transformers due to the voltages occurring on transmission systems is made, basing them on the most recent data obtainable. The data indicate that the worst stresses, both within the winding and to ground, are in the vicinity of the line coil."
"To the Board of Directors: One of the Committee's principal functions has been to serve as a connecting organization between the world of physics and the Institute. We have been trying to serve this purpose by encouraging papers which bring in new concepts, phenomena, and terminology from working physicists, and discouraging contributions which are results of “inbreeding.” Dielectric phenomena and dielectric theory are two particularly live topics, and there is a constant danger of unnecessarily burdening the Institute publications with contributions which contain more undigested data and unfounded speculations, and which do not bring us any nearer to a rational understanding of the underlying molecular phenomena."
"This is a study of the 60-cycle flashover of strings up to voltages of 1100 kv., undertaken at the Ryan High-Voltage Laboratory, Stanford University. Investigation was made of the variations in flashover voltage for similar horizontal and vertical strings, with and without shields and tower members. An attempt has been made to correlate these flashover voltages with the point-to-point and point-to-grounded-plane arc-over voltages established in 1928 at the Laboratory.1"
"Wherever lamps are to be installed on a fairly close spacing, there is a growing tendency to use 20-ampere straight series street lighting circuits in preference to 6.6-ampere circuits, which have been so generally used in the past. Several 20-ampere systems have been in use for more than a year, and reports' of operation are very favorable."
"ALTHOUGH a number of calorimeter tests have been made in this country and abroad to determine the loss in turbine generators when operating at the full-load full-voltage 0 per cent power over exciter condition, very little if anything has been published on tests at 80 per cent power factor, and the idea has always lurked in the minds of engineers that possibly the load loss under these conditions might be of a different magnitude."
"Some of the most vital of recent developments in electrical engineering will be discussed at the District Meeting of the Institute which will be held December 2 to 4 at the Drake Hotel, Chicago, Ill. Inspection trips of special interest have been arranged and a banquet and dance will be enjoyed."

Vice-President of the Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc. disclosing some of the most recent wonders of science in the field of sound transmission. Just a glance over the modern marvels to be illustrated and explained will reveal the electric ear, scrambled speech, delayed speech, double-ended short wave high power radio tubes, amplified muscle noises, translation of mechanical impulses into speech, the artificial larynx, and so on down the list of the latest work in sound transmission — the results of organized effort to extend the range of the human voice. Mr. Grace has shown that he can entertain audiences of every type, scientists and laymen. The Program Committee feels that this is an unusual opportunity to spend not only a particularly interesting and instructive evening, but it is as sure that all will go away with a fuller realization of the place of science in American progress. The meeting will be held at 8 p. m. in the Engineering Auditorium, 33 West 39th Street, New York, N. Y."

"Bernard Arthur Behrend was born in Villeneuve, Switzerland, May 9, 1875. He was educated by tutor and studied at the Polytechnic Institute and the University of Berlin. In 1895 he was assistant to the late Gisbert Kapp and in 1896 he became Assistant Chief Engineer to the Oerlikon Company in Switzerland. Thence he came to the United States in 1898, subsequently becoming non-resident lecturer at the University of Wisconsin. In 1899 he became connected with the Bullock Electric Mfg. Co. of Cincinnati, Ohio, as Chief Engineer of its alternating-current work and later, as Chief Engineer of all its plants in the United States and Canada. In 1904 the Bullock Company became allied with the Allis-Chalmers Company and Mr. Behrend became Chief Engineer of the electrical departments of this country, establishing the department in Milwaukee for the manufacture of large units. At the end of 1908 the receivers of the Westinghouse Company engaged Mr. Behrend and members of his staff to take charge of the power engineering department at East Pittsburgh. Remaining connected with these interests for eighteen years, he devoted himself to general consulting work in Boston."
"This paper describes briefly the operating experience arising from the installation of a four-wire 120/208-volt network with combined light and power mains. The most interesting problems of operation are outlined with their subsequent solutions. Fifteen months' network operation indicates that with care in layout and selection of equipment, important operating problems would be negligible."
"The paper describes the electrical features of a continuous bar plate and hot strip mill recently placed in service at Middletown, Ohio, including information regarding the general layout of the plant, the electrical circuits, rolling mills, the various motor drives, control arrangements, the motor-generator sets for supplying d-c. motors, and the safety devices. It also gives test data on the power consumption."
"When an ordinary transformer is subject to transient voltage excitation, local concentration of voltage takes place in which the capacitance charging current of the coils to ground is supplied through the winding. This is because the ratio of inductance and capacitance of the various parts throughout the winding is not constant. Calculations and tests of voltage distribution in the winding, caused by the impact of (a) damped high-frequency oscillations, and (b) unidirectional traveling waves, are given. In order to make the analysis clearer, the transformer winding is considered as a network of inductances and capacitances, and this term “network” is used throughout the paper. Certain simplified and typical networks are considered. Transformers having one terminal grounded, such as are used in three-phase star connection, particularly in high-voltage systems, are frequently built with the insulation graded to other windings and ground, in the order of the normal frequency voltage stress. The danger of such a practise is shown in power transformers which are subject to transient overvoltage, since voltage oscillation in the winding may raise the voltage to ground at intermediate points above the terminal voltage, unless the design of the winding eliminates oscillation. The theoretical and experimental data given show that the distribution and magnitude of voltage stresses existing during recognized standard insulation tests are essentially different from stresses created by transient voltages. This permits the construction of transformers that would satisfactorily pass standard insulation tests but at the same time would not be suitable for average service. A new type of a transformer called “non-resonating,” for use on grounded neutral systems, is described. In transformers of this type, voltages of all frequencies distribute uniformly along the windings, as the possibility of internal voltage resonance is eliminated by a proper balance of distributed capacitance and inductance of the winding. This is accomplished principally by means of conducting surfaces (shields) placed outside of the winding and connected to its line terminal. The action of the shields is similar to that of the shielding ring on an insulator string. It neutralizes the effect of the capacitance current from the inside surface of the winding to ground, by supplying to every point of the winding a “charging” current equal to the “discharging” current of that point to ground. In some cases, the application of the shield reduces the local stresses to one-eightieth. Up to the present time, the total capacity of this new type of transformer exceeds half a million kva."
"Within the past few months, the Cincinnati Street Railway Company has completed the rehabilitation of its entire power system. The system now consists of 19 full automatic synchronous converter substations upon which has been superimposed a complete system of supervisory control and remote metering. Papers have been presented by Frank W. Peters and Harley L. Swift, covering the details of this installation. This paper discusses the economic factors involved in the selection of equipment and the design of the system. Part I points out that the most important economic consideration is service and presents a method for evaluating this factor. Part II discusses the design of feeder circuits with particular reference to the limitations of Kelvin's Law. Part III discusses system design with reference to the economics involved in the location of substations, and in the selection of control equipment. A general method for conducting extensive system studies is implied. Part IV discusses system load-shifting characteristics and Part V points out the advantages of supervisory control."
"In this paper are described recent developments in telephone construction practises which react to preserve the integrity of the sheath of lead-covered cable, thus decreasing insulation troubles due to moisture seeping through armor breaks and warding off serious service interruptions."
"In large turbine generators, there is no convenient method for determining the iron losses under load. It is the purpose of this paper to show, analytically, the factors influencing the change in iron loss with load; that on the basis of the flux distributions, the machines can be most conveniently divided into end zones, which present three dimensional problems, and a large central zone, which presents only two dimensional problems. The losses in each part are discussed qualitatively, and the losses in the central zone are obtained quantitatively for an ideal machine in which only the foundamentals of the flux waves are present. Contrary to the usual view, these losses do not vary as the square of the generated voltage, but are predominantly affected by the ratio of the slot to total leakage reactance. The results are given in curves. The complications in the problem introduced by the usual commercial designs by non-sinusoidal field forms, phase bands, etc., are discussed qualitatively."
"A portable impulse generator delivering 400 kv. has been constructed. A cathode ray oscillograph of the cold cathode type has been so connected that impulses incoming over the transmission line to which it is connected will initiate the oscillograph. The results of studies on a 5.77-mi. section of a 66-kv. line of the Turners Falls Power Company are given. Impulses of definite forms are applied to the line. The theory of traveling waves is being checked experimentally, demonstrating the existence and magnitude of reflections, both for open-ended lines and for lines closed through gaps or a combination of inductance and capacity. A simple description of the theory is given. Some preliminary results are given for attenuation obtained by successive reflections from either end of the line. The reduction of the incoming waves by an oxide film lightning arrester is given, the affected wave in one case having a front of six microseconds and in another case a front of 0.5 microseconds. Further work to be done includes the effect of traveling waves on choke coils, transformers and ground wires. Additional work is to be done to determine the laws governing attenuation."
"Excerpts from letters of appreciation."
"The Department of Commerce under the Air Commerce Act is responsible for the installation, operation, and maintenance of the national airways. The lighting facilities along the airways consist of revolving beacons at 10-mi. intervals and intermediate landing fields approximately every 30 mi. The intermediate landing fields, in addition to the revolving beacon, are provided with an illuminated wind cone, boundary, approach, and obstruction lights. The Department of Commerce is also responsible for the rating of airports, although their establishment, maintenance, and operation are matters of municipal or private concern. The rating of an airport is a measure of the facilities available. A preferred rating for lighting facilities requires the installation of an airport beacon to locate the airport from distant points, an illuminated wind direction indicator, white or yellow lights marking the boundary of the landing area, red lights on all obstructions, green range lights marking approaches, floodlighted hangars or other buildings as a measure of altitude and to illuminate identifying markings, a searchlight for measuring ceiling height, and suitable floodlighting for the landing area. In view of the regulating authority vested in the Department of Commerce, the practise in lighting airways and airports follows very closely established standards. The floodlighting of the landing area proper offers the greatest opportunity for original thought and ideas. There have developed two schools of opinion regarding the fundamentals of field floodlighting systems. One school favors the use of a single unit, or a group of units, at one location for floodlighting the field, which system is referred to as the centralized system. The opposing school, advocating two or more light sources placed at different locations about the field, is known as the distributed system. Both systems have in common the use of lighting units delivering a fan shaped beam of light only a few degrees wide in the vertical plane and varying from 45 deg. to 180 deg. in the horizontal plane. The present lighting facilities are found very satisfactory during fair weather but the problem of aiding the flier during fog still faces the engineer and research scientist as a problem."
"This paper is not intended as a general treatment of the above subject. It presents some of the more interesting experiences of the company with which the author is connected, in changing its designs of rotating machinery to employ fabricated steel in place of castings."
"One of the most interesting features in the work of hydroelectric development has been the persistent endeavor to utilize to the fullest extent the potentially available energy of the water flow. Performances of mechanical equipment have been so consistently improved that for a given head and volume not only are the water-wheels designed for that service of remarkably high efficiencies but the products of different manufacturers come exceedingly close to duplicating results."
"Stockholm homes are to have illuminated street numbers this year, according to a report from the Swedish capital.

"This paper considers the use of fuses on insulator strings of high-voltage overhead conductors, to interrupt the arc at times of flashover before the line relays operate to disconnect the circuit. Consideration is first given to the original development of this idea, in which a fuse was connected between the line conductor and an arcing ring, attached to the second insulator unit. When an excessive voltage occurs on the conductor to ground, there is a flash between a two-pronged horn on the top insulator unit and the ring. The circuit is completed through the fuse, which immediately opens, breaking the arc. Further consideration is given to a later development of the principle, in which two expulsion type fuses replace the two-pronged horn at the top of the insulator string and the arcing ring is placed at the conductor end of the string. Data are presented from tests and from experience on about 100 mi. of 66,000-volt circuit, of the Union Gas and Electric Company, Cincinnati, Ohio."

"As part of its special Christmas decoration last year, one of the large Parisian Department Stores (Grands Magasins du Louvre) erected on the face of its building a large electric sign (about 160 ft. long and 80 ft. high) representing in colors a panoramic view of a fete on the River Seine. On the distant bank of the river, an impressive display of fire works was produced by flashing Tamp effects, the appearance of the rockets, fountains, pinwheels, etc., being accompanied by realistic noises and explosions mechanically produced, and by smoke effects produced by steam. The cycle of operation required about twelve minutes, and then repeated. There were 15,000 lamps (ranging in size from 15 to 400 watts) used in the sign, which required nearly 50 miles of wiring and 35 motors for operating switches. The sign was made by the “Etablissements Jacopozzi.”"

"Seizo Misaki, who was elected to membership in the Institute in December 1899 when he was chief engineer and superintendent for the Hanshin Electric Railroad Company, Kotee, Japan, died at his home at Ashiya, near Kobe, February 23, 1929, after a brief illness of only a few days. Born at Hiogo Gen, Japan, July 1867, Mr. Misaki was educated in the common and high schools there, and after his graduation, served a year as a teacher. Subsequent education was in a private, higher school at Tokyo. In 1887 he learned English in grammar-school at San Francisco and later in the boys' high school. In 1891–92 he was a student at the Stanford University and was graduated from the Electrical Department of Purdue University in 1894. He then entered the engineers office of the Miyoshi Electric Works, Tokyo, and was also consulting engineer for t he Kitano Electric & Mfg Co., Osake, Japan. From 1895 to 1899 he acted as popular consulting engineer at Tokyo designing several large plants and machinery, in fact, almost all the newer type of machinery manufactured by the Miyoshi Electric Works was of his design. While still a resident of Japan, Mr. Misaki made short trips to the United States to study electrical progress, especially with regard to railroading. Immediately prior to his death his court standing was raised to the sixth rank, junior grade in recognition of his services to the State."

"As announced in the April issue of the JOURNAL, the New York Section has recently had under consideration a considerable expansion of its activities, including the organization of several groups for the purpose of carrying on activities that are deemed of particular interest to such groups. The “Power Group” has already organized and it held a meeting on the evening of April 10 as reported below."
"At a meeting of the Toronto Section held on March 8, 1929, E. M. Ashworth, Gen. Mgr., Toronto Hydro-Electric System, presented a paper entitled The Electrical Engineer and the Public, in which he discussed the natural tendencies of engineers toward concrete and physical ideas and away from the metaphysical and abstract, with an inclination toward repression of visionary tendencies. Methods by which engineers can serve the public were mentioned."
"The second annual Joint Meeting of the Cleveland Section and the Case School of Applied Science Branch was held in the Electrical Building, Case School of Applied Science, on March 19th, 1929. The dinner preceding the program was attended by eighty persons and was made especially interesting by informal introductions by Professor H. B. Dates, the first Chairman of the Cleveland Section, of seven other Past Chairmen, Mr. Henderson the present Chairman, and several guests."
"The Milwaukee Section and the Student Branches at Marquette University and the School of Engineering of Milwaukee held a joint meeting at the School of Engineering on March 6, 1929, and participated in a symposium on the subject What does the College Graduate Expect of Industry and What does the Industry Expect of Him?"
"New Developments in Electrothermics and Electrochemistry, On the evening of Friday, March 22nd, the New York Section had as a speaker, Dr. Colin G. Fink of Columbia University. Dr. Fink gave a very interesting review of recent progress in electrochemistry and elec tro thermics, touching upon the developments in the electric furnace industries; in steel, the ferroalloys; the growth of aluminum and the new beryllium. Methods of combating corrosion; the use of chromium; the electrochemistry of gases. The talk was illustrated with many slides and exhibits of articles now being manufactured as a result of the progress described. Dr. Fink closed his talk with a description of the work he is doing for the museums of New York in the restoration of ancient bronzes."

"In addition to the student activities program on Thursday morning, of which an account is included in the report on the Cincinnati Regional Meeting, elsewhere in this issue, the Counselors and Student Delegates met separately for luncheon on Wednesday and met together for luncheon on Thursday. All plans for these Conferences were made by the District Committee on Student Activities, of which Professor F. C. Caldwell, Counselor of Ohio State University Branch, is Chairman, in cooperation with the Regional Meeting Committee."
"During Farmers' Week at Michigan State College, February 4–8, the Student Branch of the Institute provided an Electrical Show having for its aims the education of the rural classes in the uses of the more common electrical phenomena and the entertainment and instruction of people especially interested in electricity. In view of these purposes the experiments and exhibits covered a wide range from the fundamental principles of the motor, generator, and transformer to television apparatus and the operation of induction furnaces. The laboratories were in full operation, showing exactly the nature of the work done by the students during the school year. It has been the custom of the Branch in the past to hold the show for three days during Farmers' Week, but this year it was held open on the fourth day, at the request of the State Board of Agriculture. The attendance was estimated at from 8000 to 8500."
"The Third Annual Conference on Student Activities of the North Central District was held at the University of South Dakota on March 8 and 9, 1929, Six of the eight Branches in the District were represented by both Counselors and Chairmen, and another was represented by the Chairman only. Dean O. J. Ferguson, Vice-President, District No, 6, and Professor O. E. Edison, Secretary of the District, were present."

"Paul Milton Downing, Vice-President in Charge of Electric Construction and Operation for the Pacific Gas & Electric Company, San Francisco, California, and Vice-President of the Institute 1925–1927, was born in Newark, Missouri. He was graduated from grammar school in 1889 and in 1891 had the degree of B. S. conferred upon him by Washington College. Thereafter he entered Stanford University, from which he was graduated with the degrees of A. B. and E. E. in the pioneer class of 1895. During his college career he was active in athletics being one of the football team all four of his college years, and captain of the team in 1894, with Herbert Hoover as treasurer. He was active also on the baseball nine. His interest in the affairs of the University is still keen as President of the Stanford Alumni Association — an office which he has held for three consecutive terms ending with the current year."
"THE integrity of modern transformers and circuit breakers, which are essential features of all transmission systems, is due in no little measure to the insulating oil now universally used in such apparatus. While the oil is a relatively minor part of these devices as a whole, its failure will mean the failure of the apparatus. This is increasingly true as the voltage of the transmission systems is increased. The service rendered by the oil used as an insulating medium in electrical apparatus, is radically different from service rendered by oil in any other class of service and there are rigid requirements for oil for this service which do not exist where oil is used for other purposes. In fact, insulating oil may be considered a material of construction rather than a material of maintenance."
"IN making plans for the future in the electrical utility business it is necessary to make estimates of future growth. Various methods have been used. The usual method is to plot growth of one kind or another against time. This gives an upward curve which is difficult to project mathematically and usually is misleading if projected ahead more than two or three years in a rapidly growing territory. In the electrical utility field various values have been plotted against the number of consumers or meters. This is all right for past data but for the future the number of meters or consumers would have to be estimated and this would depend upon the increase in population, especially if all the present population now had service. This led to the use of population as the abscissa rather than time or consumers with any of the values desired as ordinates. This gives a straight line for practically all present values and the future is a straight line projection with a simple formula. The lower end of the line does not usually cross both zero points and this fact gives the changing values per unit of population."
"This terminates the second year of the existence of this committee. The field of action in which this relatively new committee finds itself is so broad and has so many inviting byways that it has been difficult to outline the work. The engineering in connection with the application of automatic control is so fascinating as to result in so many new ideas being steadily developed that the fundamentals are sometimes almost overlooked. It is indeed amazing to realize the changes in ideas which occur in this branch of the industry in a single year. This committee attempts in the following report to outline some of the development and offer suggestions which are intended to benefit this branch of the industry."
"Under our modern conditions it has become a common experience to have certain improvements adopted as necessities, although at some earlier time they would have been classed as extreme luxuries. Electrical service rendered by metropolitan public utility companies in recent years has evolved into one of these necessities due to the change in customs and in living conditions of the American people. In the initial stages of development, while the central station industry was taking the preliminary steps to establish itself in the commercial field, its product being expensive was purchased only where it could be indulged in as a luxury. During this period, methods of utilization of electrical service were very limited, being confined almost entirely to illumination. Such electric systems as existed were small, and the problem of their continuity was not of major importance. Disturbance and even interruption to customers' supply was a regrettable but not a vital incident. Cost of energy was the principal consideration rather than the reliability of supply, particularly where strong competition with other established forms of service was to be expected. As the art developed, many efforts were made to improve the quality of service in order to make a more salable product; nevertheless some interruptions were still experienced and were usually considered a necessary evil. With a much improved, but less expensive product, other competing methods of supply gradually became obsolete, leaving the central station alone in its field with an obligation to render the best possible service. Then interruptions could no longer be considered minor incidents."
"The New York 60-cycle system is operating with connections giving parallel paths between generating units only at the load. High values of reactance result for synchronizing circuits between the several generating units, but the usual values are present in the main energy channels between generators and load. Connections are contrasted with two common types of metropolitan power systems; i. e., the “close linked” and “loose linked” systems, and are shown supplemental to multiple-feed network distribution, as the principle of using separate multiple feeds from independent generators connected in parallel only at the load extends the network distribution system to the generating stations. In completely networked distribution, the 120/208-volt mains acting as a short-circuit-proof bus, supply the only synchronizing paths between generators. Substation busses serving radial load are substituted where complete networks do not exist. Calculations, tests, and operating experience indicate synchronizing power sufficient to give stability to all elements of the system not directly affected by a fault. Some advantages derived are: Increased reliability of generating sources, lower interrupting duties on circuit breakers, and reduction in service voltage disturbance."
"This paper describes the results of calculations made for operating the Hell Gate and Sherman Creek generating stations of the United Electric Light and Power Company, synchronized at the load. After reducing the numerous branches of the system to a simpler equivalent, calculations were made on the operation of an isolated section. These calculations indicated ample static stability and transient stability under fault conditions representing the maximum which might normally be expected. Other calculations were made indicating that the entire system with synchronizing paths completed through the substation low-voltage busses, would likewise meet the required stability conditions. Tentative system design factors based on the calculations and experience to date are suggested as a guide to system planning. This paper shows a practical application of the theories and principles developed in the studies of transmission stability. In the present case, a somewhat different object was in view inasmuch as it was desired to substantiate ideas as to the feasibility of the plan of synchronizing at the load rather than to obtain numerical limits."
"System test results, operating connections, and experience with the New York City system synchronized at the load are given. Data obtained by test are presented, showing the behavior of the system when generators are operated synchronized only through a low-voltage a-c. secondary network. The adaptation of this method of connections to the New York City 60-cycle system, including system layout, station and feeder rearrangement, and automatic recording apparatus, is described. Experience with these connections has demonstrated that stable performance of prime movers is obtained, load and wattless control is simplified, oil circuit breaker duty is reduced, and voltage fluctuation at customer's service during system disturbances is materially decreased."
"THE Institute, meeting here in convention on the “stern and rock bound coast” of New England, finds itself on historic ground. In this region are located many battle fields, of arms and of intellect, that have left their deep impress on our civilization. The battle fields of arms are marked by monuments that are now shrines of an appreciative people. The battles of the intellect, though often accompanied by bloodshed, are not so well remembered. Bunker Hill is fresher in our minds than are Salem and Roger Williams, yet Williams' heroic struggle for freedom of thought paved the way for that later struggle marked by the shaft on Bunker Hill."
"An attempt is made to describe simply and clearly the basis of the temperature rating of oil-immersed transformers and the relations between the temperatures measured in service, the maximum safe output rating, and the national standard ratings. A description is given of an instrument for indicating the safe output rating of a transformer in service under any conditions of short time or continuous loading."
"In this paper, La Place's and Poisson's equations are applied to cases of current-carrying conductors in rectangular slots to show the flux distributions which obtain. The paper first treats with the general case which is a single conductor, completely surrounded by insulation, at the bottom of a slot. Next is taken up the more practical case of a slot containing two insulated conductors, one above the other, in which currents of equal magnitude are considered first to flow in the same direction, and then in opposite directions. In addition to these analyses, a few special cases are discussed. Methods by which the flux distributions in slots containing an even number of coil sides may be obtained, or in slots the conductors of which carry currents not in time-phase, are also discussed. Equations are developed from which all of these fields can be calculated. A discussion is included to show the distribution of flux on the assumption that the lines go straight across the slot, and a comparison is made between the slot inductance determined mathematically from the equations developed and by the usual design formulas. In the case considered it is found that the design formulas give a value of slot inductance which is about 96 per cent of that obtained by the mathematical treatment, which is within limits of engineering accuracy. An expression is developed which shows the error that may be expected in any particular case."
"A brief résumé of the nature of telephonic signals is given, showing how the qualities of wave composition which distinguish signals from other electrical waves set the requirements on networks and provide a basis for their design. The principal functions of wave filters, equalizers, telephone transformers, line balancing networks, and artificial lines are outlined. In order that these networks may be used in conjunction with other apparatus in the telephone system, they must provide efficient transmission, low distortion, good impedance balance, stoppage of longitudinal currents, stable characteristics with current variations, low external coupling, and low reflection coefficient. In addition to these requirements, the network must not cross-talk into associated circuits and must have desirable impedance characteristics in the attenuation range of frequencies as well as throughout the transmission range. An illustration of the use of transmission networks in a typical three-channel carrier telephone system is given describing the functions of the line filter sets, the directional filter sets, band filters, and equalizers. Some of the engineering limitations on the design and construction of networks are discussed."
"The Mexican Railway Company, Ltd., locally known as Ferrocarril Mexicano, was the first railway built in Mexico, having been opened to traffic January 1, 1873. The main line runs between Mexico City and Vera Cruz and is 264 mi. in length. There are six branch lines which increase the route miles to a total of 482. The most difficult portion of the line consists of 19 mi. of 4.7 per cent grade between Encinar and Boca del Monte where the table-land is reached. In 1921, when the road was returned to its owners, following five years of government operation, the property was found to be in an unsatisfactory condition, with operating expenses more than doubled, thereby increasing the operating ratio from 0.51 in 1914 to 0.79 in 1920. Higher wages and new working agreements were largely responsible and continued to become more difficult. The mountain division had about reached its maximum capacity with the existing equipment, making it necessary to consider improvements. A study of the operating costs of this section was made in 1921 from which it was apparent that the electrification of that section would readily relieve the congestion and make it possible to more than double the capacity of the line, and at the same time accomplish a yearly saving of $523,000 in operating expense. The electrification was estimated to cost $2,420,000, thus indicating a return of 21 per cent on the gross investment including electric locomotives, in addition to the increased capacity and many other advantages. Construction work was started in January 1923 and electrical operation between Orizaba and Esperanza was complete in January 1925. The total cost for the 29 mi. section was $2,427,480.00. Internal disturbances delayed the work several months and reduced the traffic greatly. In March and April 1928 the traffic becomes comparable with that of September and October 1921, for which period the actual traffic records and operating costs for steam operation had been used as a basis for comparison with the estimated cost of an equal traffic with electrical operation. A comparison of actual operating costs of items affected by electrification for the two periods showed that 10 electric locomotives had hauled 36 per cent greater tonnage in 40 per cent less train hours than had 25 steam locomotives and at 50 per cent of the cost for items affected. When the figures were properly adjusted to compensate for increased tonnage and higher wages, the saving indicated was at the rate of $663,348 per year, a return of 26 per cent on the total cost of the electrification. In the meantime the general results had been so satisfactory that the electrification was extended 35 mi. south to Paso del Macho, making a total of 64 mi. at a cost of $3,606,937.00."
"The design of a simple mechanical speed indicator, consisting of a rotating cup and a ball placed inside of the cup, is described and discussed. This speed indicator can be built to give precise indication through a range of ± 2 per cent of a given speed. The order of precision in reading is about 1/10 of 1 per cent. When driven positively by a synchronous motor, it can be used as an accurate frequency meter."
"That the electrical development of the southern states has been the most important factor in the economic renaissance of this section is generally recognized; but the fact that in recent years the South has been forging ahead electrically at a far more rapid rate than has the country as a whole may not be generally known."
"Last year the American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced that the Bell Telephone Laboratories had perfected a deep sea telephone cable suitable for transatlantic operation. Work is now going forward actively on the development of a cable system of this type for connection between London and New York City and it is possible that this circuit will go in service as early as 1932. While the new cable will yield only a single telephone circuit, this will be one of maximum reliability, free from the variations characteristic of radio circuits. It is not the idea that the cable will replace radio circuits but it will add considerably to the reliability of New York-London service as well as adding to the total message capacity."
"Because of the magnitude of the projects and the rapid development that is taking place in certain phases of the iron and steel industry, especially in regard to application of electric power an annual report of application of electric power, to the iron and steel industry must necessarily be a continued story from year to year. These developments are keeping pace with the investigation of the metallurgist, which investigations have resulted in new processes for shaping steel."
"One of the most thoroughly enjoyed meetings of the Institute was held June 24–28, when over 1000 members and guests attended the Summer Convention at the New Ocean House, Swampscott, Mass.

"William B. Jackson, Rate Engineer of The New York Edison Company and a member of the Institute since 1897 (Life Member), was its Manager from 1912 to 1915 and a Vice-President from 1918 to 1919. Coincidently, he was a Manager and Vice-President of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 1915; also President of the Western Society of Engineers in 1915. His papers before the Institute and Western Society of Engineers on Advantages of Unified Electric Systems Covering Large Territories, and Hydraulic Developments as Related to Electric Installations were in early presentation of the lines along which electric and power development has since progressed."
"The measurement of torque under unstable conditions of speed is usually extremely difficult and inaccurate when a dynamometer, prony brake, or similar torque measuring equipment is used. The device described in this paper was developed primarily to obtain torque measurements under unstable conditions as well as under stable conditions, and to obtain a permanent record of these measurements. It has been particularly successful in recording speed-torque curves of motors during acceleration and it can also be applied very effectively to other fields."
"This paper describes extensive field tests made on the super-high-speed excitation equipment used with the 30,000-kv-a. synchronous condensers at the Plymouth Meeting Substation of the Philadelphia Electric Company. Oscillograms and calculated curves showing the performance of the synchronous condensers with this equipment are included, together with a discussion of the results obtained."
"The factors determining the power-carrying capacity of a transmission system are briefly discussed in this paper. The principal effects obtained by the operation of synchronous condensers used to compensate for the system consumption of lagging reactive kv-a. are pointed out. This method of compensation is contrasted with the direct method of supplying the reactive kv-a. to the line in the manner in which it is consumed, i. e., by the series method. A plan for obtaining direct or series reactive kv-a. compensation by a method employing electric machinery is described. This includes a description of a method for producing the required voltage and inserting it into the system. Some of the characteristics of operation and advantages to be gained by the use of the described method are given."
"Construction and operating experience has shown that a large part of the theoretically possible gains in efficiency due to higher steam pressures has been obtained in practise. What are the future possibilities of higher pressures? The biggest problem before station designers today is to reduce the cost of construction per unit of capacity. Some engineers have suggested that we should build cheaper and less economical stations. This is an unsatisfactory answer to the problem. The proper answer is to maintain the high standards of efficiency that have been established and reduce the cost of construction by intensive study and better design. Better engineering in the future is the answer to the problem. By the use of large turbine generator units and large steam generating units, the unit cost of construction can be reduced materially. The present practise of installing several boilers to serve one turbine generator increases the cost of construction. The use of large steam generating and turbine generator units will reduce the unit cost of high-pressure stations more than it will reduce the unit cost of normal pressure stations. If the steam generating units match the turbine generator units in capacity, we can design for unit construction. This unit construction will not only reduce the cost of construction but will also simplify operation."
"To the Board of Directors: The Committee on Electrochemistry and Electrometallurgy submits the following report covering some of the outstanding matters of interest within the field of the committee. Such a review can never claim to be complete. The past year has brought several items of unusual interest. As an innovation in the report of the committee, for the present year somewhat more details are given about certain materials and their production, including the features likely to be of interest to electrical engineers. For this reason, the number of items covered in the report is somewhat less than in the reports for the several years preceding."
"This paper outlines some of the physical reasons and economic advantages influencing the establishment of Washington Park Distributing Station of the Commonwealth Edison Company of Chicago. This station is located at the electrical center of the load which it supplies. It receives energy at 66 kv. from an outlying generating station, State Line Station. The voltage is reduced at the distributing station and fed to a number of substations at 12 kv. The past practise of this company has been to feed the substations at 12 kv. directly from generating stations. However, a study indicated several reasons for discarding the practise in this case. The main physical reasons were the congested condition in the underground cable system surrounding Calumet Generating Station and the distance from Calumet Station to its dependent substations. The economic advantages consisted primarily of the decrease in transmission line costs due to the location of the distributing station at the center of the zone load and the savings resulting from the use of 66-kv. instead of 12-kv. for the primary transmission system."
"Tests of circuit breakers, relays, and similar devices in which current transformers have been used to step down the large currents involved to values measurable by the oscillograph, have shown peculiar errors in the records during the transient portion of the current wave. The purpose of this paper is to show that the abnormal excitation of the magnetic circuit of the current transformer required during transient conditions is the cause of these errors, and to point out how the errors may be minimized sufficiently to be negligible. Mathematical expressions are also derived to make it possible to predetermine the ability of a transformer to handle transients correctly and to be a guide in the design of transformers for this service."
"To the Board of Directors: Following established precedent, your Committee submits a brief review of the year's development in the application of electricity to transportation."
"In the second part of this paper and in the appendices, attention is given to simplified methods of treating the problem of system stability. Methods which have been found useful in making many system studies are recorded. These methods have had considerable verification by tests both on a model system and on large operating systems and have been simplified to such an extent that many operating companies are now finding it to their advantage to undertake the work of making careful studies of their own systems, just as they now make short-circuit studies which formerly were thought too difficult and too highly theoretical. The first part of the paper gives some comments and conclusions of the authors and their colleagues as a result of many such system studies as well as studies involving more detailed methods, and also as the result of practical experience through contact with various operating companies. Some of these comments are based directly upon an example which is given in detail in Appendix I."
"To the Board of Directors: The activities of the Committee on Applications to Marine Work this year were devoted chiefly to the consideration of future revisions in the Marine Standards (A. I. E. E. Standard No. 45) and in further efforts to induce the U. S. Steamboat Inspection Service to arrange for proper recognition and classification of the electrical engineer on shipboard. Owing to the few active matters for consideration by the committee, and the unusual activity in new marine construction placing a large demand upon the time of most of the committee, the meetings of the committee were curtailed."
"To the Board of Directors: Your Committee on General Power Applications has attempted to keep in close touch with the development of power applications during the year through the selection by the various members of the committee of specific industries in which they were deeply interested and on which they agreed to furnish a condensed report early in 1929."
"To determine insulation for an outdoor 220-kv. station on the coast subject to ocean spray, an insulator test rack was installed at Redondo, California. Ten types of insulator, including widely different designs, were tested continuously for two years and a half at 150 kv. to ground. Comparative results were obtained by adding or subtracting units in suspension strings until an equality against arc-over was approximated. Ninety arc-overs occurred. The surface leakage resistance was found to be a fair index of the resistance to arc-over under salt spray conditions. The shape of the insulator made no difference as long as the total surface resistance of the string remained the same. The surface resistance is that calculated upon the assumption of a uniform conducting coating upon all the exposed surface of the insulator and is the line integral of distance divided by circumference along the shortest surface path from cap to pin. Accidental differences of conditions are such that one insulator string would not consistently arc-over in preference to another unless its surface resistance were less than 80 per cent of the other. Suspension strings having a total surface resistance of 11.0, using inch units, were found satisfactory for a steady 150 kv. to ground under the conditions at Redondo. A spray method of cleaning insulators while energized was devised."
"To the Board of Directors: In the past many criticisms have been made against the mining industry as being backward in modern developments. Certainly such criticisms are no longer justified to the same extent as a decade or two ago."
"The usual method of determining the voltage ratio of audio-frequency transformers employs a three-element vacuum tube in the circuit. Due to the fact that the results are a combination of both transformer and vacuum tube characteristics this method is not entirely satisfactory. This paper describes a new method, using a low-voltage cathode ray oscillograph, by means of which the voltage ratio of a transformer is determined independent of any other apparatus This newly developed method is accurate and simple in operation, and gives the actual characteristics of the transformer for all frequencies and d-c. components. The ratios of several makes of transformers were determined over a frequency range of 20 to 10,000 cycles and at different degrees of magnetic saturation. The results indicate that the ratios are very good between frequencies of 40 and 3000 cycles. Saturation within the usual operating limits was found to have little effect. The method developed was found to be exceptionally good, as the results are accurate and are readily reproduced. However, precautions must be taken to eliminate stray fields which may influence the tube unless properly shielded."
"To the Board of Directors: This terminates the second year of the existence of this committee. The field of action in which this relatively new committee finds itself is so broad and has so many inviting byways that it has been difficult to outline the work. The engineering connection with the application of automatic control is so fascinating as to result in so many new ideas being steadily developed that sometimes the fundamentals are almost overlooked. In the following report, this committee attempts to outline some of the development and offer suggestions which are intended to benefit this branch of the industry."
"The report of the Committee on Production and Application of Light calls attention to the outstanding advancements and trends in the art of lighting by electricity. Material used in the compilation has been furnished not only by members of the committee but by other authorities in various fields."
"The popularity of the present suntan vogue and its hearty endorsement by prominent members of the medical profession point to the probability of the demand for artificial sources of sunshine being permanent rather than the fad of a day."
"From the standpoint of mobile color lighting, the International Exposition held this year at Barcelona, Spain, is the most exquisite display of its kind ever produced. It is particularly interesting as to the quantity of colored light employed and the extent of the area over which coordinated sequence is maintained, In length, this area is approximately one-third of a mile. and in width it averages 350 ft. Both as to colors and intensities, this widespread synchronized mobility is controlled through a multiplicity of circuits which appear hopelessly intricate until the systematic desing and arrangements are understood. The apparatus, to control automatically the changing colors, (5000-kw. connected load), cost approximately $250,000.00 exclusive of freight, erection, wiring, or the electric distribution system."
"The regulations with respect to automobile headlamps, included in the Uniform Traffic Act of the State of Minnesota, have now been in force for over two years."

"Frederick Bedell, member of the Institute since 1892, Manager 1914–17, and Vice-President 1917–18, was born in Brooklyn, N. Y., April 1868. After an undergraduate Arts course at Yale, he took graduate courses in science, engineering and mathematics at Cornell University, receiving the degree of Doctor of Philosophy and joining the instructing staff in 1892. In 1893 he was appointed Assistant Professor of Physics, and, in 1904, Professor of Applied Electricity, a position he still holds."
"The telephone transmission system described here is the Master Reference System of the Bell System for the expression of transmission standards and the ratings of the transmission performance of telephone circuits. The transmitter and receiver elements of this system are reference standards for the ratings of the transmitting and receiving performance of terminal station sets. A replica of this reference system installed in Paris has been adopted as the Master Reference System of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephone Communication in Europe. The establishment of these two master systems provides a common reference for the telephone transmission work of the Bell System and the telephone administrations which are members of this International Advisory Committee."
"The purpose and usefulness of shielding in high-frequency measurement are outlined. General principles of electrostatic shielding are developed as applied to simple impedances and to networks of impedances, particularly to bridge networks. Practical applications of these principles to the shielding of adjustable impedances, and in the construction of actual bridge circuits are described."
"This paper presents practical information regarding the application of high-frequency (180-cycle) induction motors with low-resistance rotors to portable electric tools. In order to compete with existing tools it became necessary to increase the rotor speed above 60 cycles, and 180 cycles per second was adopted as commercially practical. Several advantages are shown. Due to a smaller drop in speed with this type of motor than with the direct current and the universal motor, greater power is developed. Because of better speed regulation the life of the cutting tools is longer. Less weight and lower maintenance costs result from this application. Several new tools for special work are described. The desirable regulation of the frequency converter or motor-generator is given as not exceeding 8 per cent."
"A new street lighting system has been installed on two converging streets in Cheney, Washington, so as to form an arrowhead of light, pointing in the direction of Spokane. Aviators, when flying at night from the West Coast to Spokane, are able to pick up the lights of Cheney and by following the direction of the guiding arrow, find it a simple matter to locate their destination at the large landing field at Spokane."
"The author of this correspondence wishes to add some further verification to conclusions of the above-named article by M.C. Holmes (A.I.E.E. Journal, March 1929, p. 224). The author states that he and a colleague have made several calorimeter tests on turbine generators and found that the load losses at the normal voltage, zero per cent power factor, overexcited condition were substantially the same as those measured on short-circuit. Recently they have made similar tests on some rather large machines at 80 per cent power factor and found the same conditions. In none of these machines was the pole face loss abnormally high, yet, if anything, the load loss at normal voltage was a little greater than that measured on short circuit. Also, they have made calculations to determine the axial depth of flux penetration in the armature iron near the ends of the machine, and obtained results comparable to those shown in Fig. 8 of Holmes' paper (see \"Iron Losses in Turbine Generators,\" by C.M. Laffoon and J.F. Calvert, A.I.E.E. Quarterly TRANS., 48, Part 3, 1929)."
"Hydrogen is an excellent cooling medium for high-speed rotating electrical machinery. When it is substituted for air, a machine can be operated at a higher load with the same temperature rise and the windage loss is decreased to one-twelfth. Furthermore, since no oxidation can take place in this type of machine, the life of the insulation is increased and short circuit and corona troubles are very materially reduced. The machine is especially quiet, and it can be placed out of doors without increased expense. The first commercial application of hydrogen cooling for electrical machinery was made on a 12,500-kv-a. outdoor synchronous condenser. Another outdoor hydrogen-cooled condenser designed along these lines rated 20,000 kv-a., is also in operation. Both condensers were placed in service in 1928 and their performance has been very satisfactory. This paper describes the construction of the machines and reviews the advantages and disadvantages of hydrogen cooling."
"This paper presents a new general purpose type of hot cathode oscillograph which employs a new electrostatic method of focusing the beam. This oscillograph will operate at any beam potential from 500 to 20,000 volts or more, and at any gas pressure below 30 microns. High photographic sensitivity at medium voltages is attained by the use of a high-intensity beam. A portable form of the oscillograph for recording lightning surges on transmission lines is described, together with circuits by means of which the lightning surge automatically starts the beam in from 1/2 to 1/4 microseconds after the surge voltage begins to rise from zero. This oscillograph was put into operation on one of the 140-kv. transmission lines of the Consumers Power Company of Jackson, Michigan, on August 27, 1928."
"Networks of telephone circuits which are extensively used in the transmission of programs to broadcasting stations are described in this paper. Certain stages in the development of these networks are considered and the general requirements for satisfactory transmission at the present time are enumerated. The arrangements of the networks as well as the procedures used in setting up and maintaining them are discussed."
"Study of transformers has been under way for some time to coordinate the strength of transformers and transmission-line insulation under lightning conditions. This study has taken two forms; first, the transient dielectric strength of the line end of the winding and second, the distribution of transient voltages and therefore the stress caused by them throughout the winding. Theoretical studies and spark-gap tests of transient voltage distribution in transformer windings have been previously published by the Institute. Since then an extensive study of transient voltage phenomena has been made by the cathode ray oscillograph on power transformers connected to a short transmission line and subjected to artificial lightning waves sent along the line. The effects of the transmission line, concentrated inductance, and transformer entrance bushings on traveling waves were studied, as well as the effect of traveling waves of various service conditions in producting internal oscillations in ordinary transformers: The non-resonating transformer was studied under similar conditions. A striking agreement between the oscillographic records and theoretical conclusions previously published was found, sufficient to establish beyond any doubt the following conclusions: 1. Very high-voltage oscillations occur throughout the entire winding of even a grounded neutral transformer. 2. Points of the winding near the grounded neutral may rise to 95 per cent of the crest voltage of a very short traveling wave (three microseconds long). 3. Entrance bushings have a negligible effect on the shape of the incoming traveling wave. 4. In case of sudden voltage changes, concentrated inductance in series with the transformer, unless by-passed by a suitable device, causes rise of voltage across the transformer terminals as well as internally in the windings. 5. Arc-over of line insulators by a traveling wave produces severe oscillations in a transformer the amplitudes of which are roughly proportional to the arc-over voltage of the line insulators. 6. Grading the insulation between high voltage and low voltage and ground in ordinary transformers with grounded neutral is a dangerous practise when the transformers are subject to lightning. 7. All the above conclusions apply to concentric winding core type as well as interleaved and shell type transformers. From theoretical studies the non-resonating type of transformer has been developed and its action checked by tests. This type of transformer eliminates voltage oscillation within the winding and therefore local concentration of transient voltage. An Appendix entitled Present Status of the Cathode Ray Oscillograph on the Measurements of Transients, by H. L. Rorden and J. C. Dowell, both of the General Electric Company, Pittsfield, Mass. is included in the complete paper."
"There have been presented before the Institute numerous papers describing various technical and apparatus developments of value in providing long distance telephone service. Several papers have also appeared covering specific transmission or operating problems, or dealing with the advance planning of the telephone plant. Feeling that it might be of interest, particularly to the young engineering graduates, the writers have prepared this over-all sketch of the general problem of actually providing, year by year, the extensions and additions to a comprehensive network of communication channels necessary to keep pace with a growing public demand for long distance service. Since the writers are most familiar with the area served by the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, the discussion will be restricted to that territory."
"This paper in its complete form presents in brief review the development of the automatic network system in the seven years since its introduction. It covers the interesting features of design found in the different systems, the changes that have been made in the design of the apparatus as a result of experience, some of the problems that have been faced in the application of the system, and finally the lines along which thought is now being directed in the future development of the system."
"The first tube of the Detroit and Canada Tunnel has been sunk to a bed of mud 80 feet below the surface of the Detroit River. This tube is one of ten which will comprise the under-water portion of the US$25,000,000 tunnel project. The ten tubes vary in length from 220 to 250 feet, with an over-all diameter of 35 feet. Their aggregate length is approximately half a mile, constituting the underwater part of the tunnel. The tubes when launched weigh in the neighborhood of 500 tons each. At the time of sinking, each tube after being concreted weighs from 7000 to 8000 tons."
"This paper discusses methods of lighting airports and airways and describes various types of lamps and equipment used for this purpose. In the information on airport illumination are included beacons, obstruction lights, boundary lights, illuminated wind direction indicators, field and building floodlights, signal lights, and ceiling illumination. The portion on airway lighting covers principal and intermediate beacons and emergency field lighting. An extensive bibliography is included in the complete paper."

Formulas for deriving numerical values of the functions are given in the form of series for large and for small values of the argument. The series are complete with their general terms. The application of the tables to the calculation of the skin effect resistance ratio of an isolated tubular conductor is described and an example is given."
"Every automobile passing through the Holland Tunnel under the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey is now registered at the exit by an electric traffic checker. The device works 24 hr a day, never missing the count, which is recorded instantly upon a dial in the administration building of the Tunnel Commission at Varick and Canal Streets in New York City. [Originally reported in \"Telephone and Telegraph Age\"]"
"The American public is rapidly becoming air-minded, and the result is that aviation is advancing faster than any previous method of transportation. Like all other modes of travel, if aviation is to succeed commercially, operations must extend into the night. Night flying necessitates lighted airways and lighted airports. Great progress is being made along those lines. Guided by Government practise, the art of lighting is becoming standardized very rapidly."
"It is quite natural for new schools of thought in design, decoration, and architecture to originate in continental Europe. The atmosphere, background, and tradition of the larger cities are all conducive to this end. Within the last half century, or even since the beginning of the 20th century, our very habits of living have undergone remarkable changes. The mechanical element in the production of all sorts of objects has come to the foreground. Speed of transportation has greatly increased. With mass production, things formerly considered luxuries have become necessities and the spirit of the age such as to make a new school of architecture and decoration come into being. The recent war, demanding practically all the thought and energy of the entire world, made it impossible for even the artist to sit back and dream of his problems. After the close of the war there was a brief period of reconstruction, but by about 1924, clever minds began to evolve a new school of decoration. For want of a better name, this has been termed “art moderne.”"
"The activities of the A. I. E. E. Summer Convention at Swampscott, Mass., start simultaneously with the printing of this issue of the JOURNAL, and the detailed account of this meeting will therefore have to be deferred until the issuance of the August JOURNAL. The plans formulated by the Convention Committee for this occasion, however, have been so comprehensive that there can be no doubt that the traditional success of our Summer Conventions will be maintained. The completed program for the technical sessions is even fuller than usual, necessitating several parallel sessions; and the sports and entertainments offered are more than ample to occupy every moment available for recreation."
"A technical program which will deal with some of the most active problems of electrical engineering is being arranged for the Pacific Coast Convention of the Institute, which will be held September 3–6, at Santa Monica, California, with headquarters at the Hotel Miramar."

It bears the inscription “Award in recognition of a signal public service. Designed to mark the entrance of the American Association of Engineers into the field of welfare.”"
"In April 1929, Doctor Guido Semenza, Local Honorary Secretary of the Institute, Milan, Italy, was made the recipient of the Farraday Medal, an honor of outstanding scientific distinction, conferred by the Institution of Electrical Engineers of Great Britain."
"Report No. 2 in the A. I. E. E. Standard's series was issued in August 1927. This report was made up of all the definitions appearing in the approved sections of the A. I. E. E. Standards of t h a t date. It was issued t a obtain criticisms and suggestions and if possible to eliminate inconsistencies. In a number of cases definitions of the same thing had developed, varying only slightly in wording. Such differences will unquestionably be necessary in some instances due to varying applications but in most cases can be eliminated through agreement of the committees having the standards affected in hand. A new report dated June 1929 is now available in which part of such coordination work has been included. The new report has also been carefully cross-indexed and brought up to date by the insertion of definitions from Standards approved since original date of publication. Copies of this new Report No. 2 may be obtained without charge by writing, H. E. Farrer, Secretary, Standards Committee, A. I. E. E., to whom all criticisms or suggestions should also be addressed."

"A Subcommittee on Abbreviations of the Sectional Committee on Scientific and Engineering Symbols and Abbreviations has been working on the development of American Standards for abbreviations for scientific and engineering terms. The work of the subcommittee has now reached the point where it is possible to print their report as the proposed Tentative American Standard. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers, one of the joint sponsors with the Institute and three other groups, has issued the report in page proof form for the purpose of criticism and comment. Abbreviations of electrical terms form a part of the report. Probably the most notable feature of the proposed abbreviations is the omission of period except where the abbreviation forms a complete word, as (arm. for armature). The Sectional Committee has made∗ the following distinction between symbols and abbreviations: A symbol is a letter or sign used in a formula as a substitute for any numerical value. A shortened expression for a name or a unit is an abbreviation and not a symbol."

Morgan, meeting in Washington, May 24, endorsed the report and recommended that a board of review consisting of non-partisan and competent civilian engineers be appointed with authority to develop the best possible solution of the Mississippi Flood Control Problem."
"The Constitution of the United States requires a census every ten years for the purpose of re-apportioning the membership of the House of Representatives. Although the census has been taken every ten years, the House of Representatives was not re-apportioned after the 1920 census. The technical and political reasons assigned for the failure of Congress to comply with this Constitutional requirement are numerous, but the outstanding fact seems to be that in the last twenty years the large cities and industrial centers have gained very rapidly in population, while the rural sections of the country have gained only slightly. Many of the Members of Congress from states thus adversely affected by a reapportionment have opposed and thus far prevented a reapportionment being made."

"The question as to what can be done to improve still further the Institute publications was discussed at length during the recent meeting of the Publication Committee. The policy in effect since January, 1928, of publishing the TRANSACTIONS quarterly and printing papers in abridged form in the JOURNAL, with complete copies available upon request of those desiring more detailed information, has solved many of the physical problems of the committee. As a further development of the committee's work it is now proposed to consider means of making the contents of the publications more valuable to the membership. It is felt, for example, that the JOURNAL would be more widely read and referred to if in addition to the present contents, special features were added in the hope that they would be of general interest to the entire membership."
"The power dissipated as ionization loss in impregnated-paper-insulated cables is much more harmful than the power dissipated in the solid dielectric. The paper presents methods of separating this ionization loss from the total dielectric loss. This separation is based on the assumption that the power loss in the solid dielectric varies as the square of the voltage, even above ionization. To verify this assumption, samples of wood-pulp paper, impregnated with three different cable compounds under such conditions as to remove nearly all traces of occluded gases, were made up. These tests showed that up to 300 volts per mil, and at room temperature, the power factor and capacitance are substantially constant, and that the power loss varies as the square of the voltage. Measurements of the electrical properties of ionized air films showed that above the ionization voltage the power loss is a linear function of the voltage. Power curves of cables can thus be analyzed into two components; one giving the loss in the solid dielectric and one giving the loss in the ionized air films. This analysis is verified with glass cable models. The power-factor curve and the energy current of the cable can each be analyzed into three simple components and extrapolated if desired. The character of the capacitance curve, which varies in different cables, is determined by the positions and thicknesses of the gas films."

"This paper describes a new carrier telephone system which is designed for use in the telephone plant as a substitute for open-wire line construction for circuits of shorter lengths than could be economically spanned by multi-channel types of carrier systems in use for longer distance transmission. This new system, which is known as the type D carrier telephone system, provides one additional talking circuit per pair of wires. The equipment is adapted to provide facilities quickly, and is capable of being moved readily from one location to another when temporary facilities are desired. The system employs a novel and original modulation circuit which is fully described in the complete paper."
"The use of single-conductor lead-covered cable for high-voltage, three-phase transmission lines results in sheath losses ranging from 25 to 300 per cent of the conductor losses for cables installed in separate ducts, unless special methods for the reduction of the losses are used. Some of these methods, while practically eliminating sheath losses, cause a-c. sheath potentials which may be injurious. In this connection, the authors have developed a new bonding scheme and a new bonding device both of which appear to have marked advantages. This article consists of a general discussion relative to the reduction of sheath losses, with special reference to laboratory tests, and to field work on 132 mi. of single-conductor cable of the Commonwealth Edison Company. The economics of sheath losses and of the methods for their practical elimination are discussed. The theories of sheath losses and induced voltages are outlined and correlated, and new formulas and curves are developed. An analytical and graphical comparison of sheath bonding connections is presented. Investigations are reported on tests regarding the nature and extent of possible corrosion of sheaths caused by a-c. sheath voltages."
"The results of some simple experiments are given to show how the magntic force, acting upon a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field, is affected as the conductor is shielded by surrounding it by a permeable shield. It is shown that the force on the conductor practically disappears if it is put inside of an iron pipe, but that the pipe experiences a force — the sum of the force in the pipe and that in the conductor being the same as that in the unshielded conductor. The idea is extended to the conductors in a slotted armature. It is shown that as the conductor is placed more deeply in the slot the force diminishes to a minimum and then experiences a slight rise at the bottom of the slot."
"CONSIDERING the wide range of types of electric circuit, it is at once evident that an equally wide variety of properties, — electrical, mechanical, and thermal, — is demanded for their insulation. Experiment and research directed toward improvements in insulation, therefore, have an almost unlimited field of opportunity. An enormous mass of experimental data from experienced investigators has already been presented. So wide is the problem, however, that these data have not only failed to place the design of insulation on a satisfactory engineering basis, but still leave it as probably the most important problem confronting the electrical engineer of today. The life of electric equipment is often limiten to that of its insulation, and the consequences of failure are usually disastrous and costly."
"Today it is apparently permitted that one take an occasional glance at the things that have been left behind in the climb up from the past without suffering the penalties imposed upon the ancients. Pillars of salt have given way to a show of reason. Foresight, is, however, denied to an amazing degree."
"This paper sets forth the features of squirrelcage motor design which differentiate it from standard motors. Much of the paper is devoted to the two-speed motor with two separate stator windings having speed ratios of 2/1, 3/1, 4/1 and 6/1. The two-speed motor with a single winding is limited to the 2/1 ratio. Higher ratios are necessary for high elevator speed and low and accurate landing speed. The elevator motor is subjected to continual starting and stopping. The effects of inertia in such service are considered in connection with motor heating. The proper division of slot area between the two stator windings and the problem of building a rotor with proper characteristics on both speeds are explained. Noise elimination is necessary in elevator motors. The effect of this requirement in design is considered. The effect of rotor skew is compared to the effect of distributed winding in the stator. The quantitative effect of skew is embodied in a constant called “skew factor.” The possibility of transformer effects between the windings of a two-speed motor is explained and methods of correcting to eliminate circulating currents are indicated."
"The use of high-voltage power lines for carrier-current communication presents a number of difficulties not met in the use of simple communication circuits. This paper tells how these difficulties may be overcome without resorting to complicated transmitting and receiving equipment. The advantages of employing tuned choke coils are described. These chokes are used to isolate the communication channel from the remainder of the power system which gives in effect a simple communication circuit between communicating points."
"Under modern conditions of operation the ability of the component machines of a power system to hold in step during system disturbances has become of major importance in the choice of system layout and machine design. This situation has greatly stimulated activity in the study of the problems involved. This paper reviews the general problem in the light of recent analytical and experimental studies made by the authors. The subject matter of the paper is grouped according to the following headings; Part I reviews the factors affecting stability, including generator short-circuit ratio, voltage regulators, excitation systems, neutral impedance, governors, amortisseurs, intermediate condensers. Part II gives methods of calculating stability, under the following heads: preliminary calculations, idealized case of two machines, general case of two machines, extension to include more than two machines, simplified method of calculating tie lines. The appendixes include an example illustrating the method of calculation in a particular case."
"Lightning phenomena are analyzed in the light of laboratory experience with high-voltage phenomena in the atmosphere. Special emphasis is placed on the effect of space charges in producing high local stresses when mobilized through channels of high conductivity caused by high temperatures. A detailed analysis is included of the steps through which air at atmospheric pressure passes when, due to applied electric stresses, its electric properties change from those of a non-conductor to those of a highly conducting body, — perhaps many times as conducting as a metallic conductor at ordinary temperature, — and then again resumes its original non-conducting properties."
"The success of the series capacitor in increasing the load capacity, as well as improving the regulation of those a-c. transmission lines on which it has been tried,2 promises to lead to its wide adoption. The high loading and excessive short-circuit currents entailed by the series capacitor have to be cared for by safety devices, and in order to be able to design and properly locate such devices, it becomes essential to predetermine the values of current and voltage at every point along the line. A step-by-step method is described for drawing the complete polar vector diagrams of current and voltage in an a-c. transmission line supplying a given load. Its chief novelty consists in the use of cellophane tissue instead of ordinary drawing paper. Such tissue is easily obtained commercially, as it is used chiefly for wrapping candy boxes. It is transparent, thin and flexible and takes ink well. The usual implements, such as scales, protractors, triangles and compasses, are unnecessary. The required vector scales, impedance triangles, and multiplying triangles are laid out in ink upon a sheet of squared paper mounted on a drawing board, and the vector diagram is produced on the superimposed celophane by tracing, the celophane sheet being shifted as required in determining successive points on the vector diagram. It is true that no step-by-step method is as accurate as the mathematical method, but the method described takes only some one or two per cent as much time as the mathematical method and with practise becomes as accurate as working conditions demand."
"A large amount of research work on high-voltage cable is being carried on throughout the country. It is generally recognized that duplication of effort can be reduced and general progress increased by comparison and common discussion of the independent investigations."
"Calculations and tests on small models have indicated that power systems at or near the theoretical power limit could not be operated safely, since any slight disturbance would cause instability with the resultant separation of the power transmission system. Very often, tests on small models do not closely check the results obtained on the real system; therefore, as a result of certain troubles which occurred on the Southeastern Power & Light Company's system in 1925, apparently due to instability, it was decided to attempt to determine by actual tests the amounts of power which could be safely carried over certain transmission lines, and to compare the results with the calculated values. The General Electric Company offered to cooperate with the engineers of the Southeastern Power & Light Company in conducting such tests, and made them of further value by suggesting experimentation with certain schemes of high-speed excitation which could be applied to the generator excitation systems, in an effort to increase the maximum power limit which could safely be carried over the transmission lines. This paper presents the results of these tests and the conclusions to be drawn from them."

"Charles Waterman Stone, Consulting Engineer for the General Electric Company, a Manager of the Institute 1908–1911, and one of its Vice-Presidents 1911–1913, was born in Providence, Rhode Island, Dec. 24, 1874. He attended the public schools in Providence and the West, and later, the University of Kansas for three and a half years. In 1894 he joined the Franklin Electric Company, of Kansas City, but two years later he returned to the East to become machinist for the W. S. Hill Electric Company, of New Bedford, Massachusetts. Where he was shortly advanced to engineer in charge. In 1899 he was chosen superintendent of construction for the Hancock Equipment Company, of Boston, of which he remained a member until he joined the General Electric Company later in that same year. His advancement was steady; starting in the Drafting Department, he was soon made assistant engineer of the Lighting Department; then engineer in charge of the Consulting Engineering Department, manager of the Lighting Department, and finally, manager of the Central Station Department, leading to his ultimate appointment as consulting engineer, his present capacity with the company. He is also consulting engineer for the RCA Photophone Company, Inc., devoting his time wholly to engineering subjects."

"This paper sets forth the reasons for making short-circuit tests upon the system of the Alabama Power Company and describes the methods of testing. The results of the early tests clearly demonstrated the necessity for making such tests and the need for adequate facilities to gather data essential to a full knowledge of the limitations of electrical equipment under actual operating conditions. A description of the modern test equipment installed in the last two years, and the method of procedure in making tests are given. A discussion of the results obtained brings out the point that the expenditures for complete testing facilities have been fully justified and have resulted in the installation of better equipment, improved protection, and a higher grade of service to customers."
"The function of a broad-band wave filter of the iterative ladder type in the attenuation band, and outside the attenuation band can be explained very simply when expressed in terms of two characteristic vectors Za and Zb. Drawing the diagram of these vectors, it becomes obvious that the angle between them is the phase shift of the filter and that the natural logarithm of the ratio of their magnitudes is the attenuation. The diagram also shows very plainly the relationship between a mid-series and a mid-shunt structure, and the equations for such filters can be derived in a very simple manner from the geometry of one vector triangle. It is hoped that this simplified presentation of types of filters which are so extensively used in radio, acoustical, and mechanical engineering will be helpful in understanding their physical meaning."
"This paper shows how the Heaviside operational methods may be applied to determine the transient currents that are produced in synchronous and induction machines by some sudden alteration of their electric circuits. The observed and computed values of the transient currents have been plotted for a number of cases. There is also a table giving the names of the principal investigators who have written on this subject, and the methods of analysis that they have employed."
"After a brief description of the construction and connections of the condenser motor, the necessity of varying the capacitance is discussed and the performance at start and under load considered. Locus diagrams illustrating the operating performance in detail are given, followed by a more detailed discussion of starting torque. The Appendix gives the mathematical derivation of many of the formulas discussed."
"This paper gives a review of some recent developments in the methods of studying lightning phenomena. The Norinder form of cathode ray oscillograph and its application in Tennessee are discussed, together with the information secured. The second part gives the theory of traveling waves along transmission lines. Reflections at open and grounded ends are considered. A mirror scheme of an infinite series of waves on a double infinite line equivalent to actual waves along a finite line is developed. The third part discusses the manner in which surges are actually produced on lines by lightning and the effect of ground resistance on the protection afforded by ground wires, both with respect to induced and direct strokes."
"The variety of articles to which the process of repair by electrodeposition can be applied has extended rapidly within recent years. This method of repair was employed extensively during the war, and has been since developed to a considerable degree in America. The experience gained by increased practise has certainly resulted in the product of a better repaired article. But it must be remembered that there can be no homogeneity in the metal of the repaired article. It is for the engineer to decide in each particular case whether the absence of homogeneity, with the consequent difference between physical and mechanical properties, is harmful to his purposes. As regards protection by electrodeposition, it should be remembered that, in so far as iron is concerned, zinc is the only really protective covering that is commercially applicable. Cadmium will protect iron almost as well as zinc, but the cost of cadmium restricts its use. Chromium does not protect iron from corrosion, though the deposit of chromium can be useful for other purposes. World Power."
"This paper gives the results of a study of the peculiar variation with temperature and frequency of the dielectric constant and power factor of rosin, rosin oil, and castor oil. It includes data showing, at several frequencies, the relation of dielectric constant and power factor to the composition of vulcanized rubber. Electrical double refraction in rosin at different frequencies and temperatures is discussed in relation to its behavior as a dielectric. It is shown that the viscosity is decisive factor controlling both the electrical and optical behavior The facts are important in themselves but it is possible to interpret them by a modern physical theory, the Debye1 dipole theory, which it is believed has not hitherto been applied to commercial dielectrics. On this theory, the anomalous change of dielectric constant and power factor with temperature and frequency is attributed not to impurities or heterogeneity of structure but to molecules containing electric doublets which try to orient themselves in an electric field. The rotation of the dipole molecules in a viscous medium gives rise to frictional heat loss expressed as power factor, and also to a contribution to the dielectric constant which vanishes when the dipoles are prevented from responding by too great viscosity or too high frequency. For the sake of intelligibility, first an outline of the dipole theory is presented and then the experimental results are discussed on the basis of that theory."
"Excerpts from letters of appreciation."
"A detailed method of calculating the no-load core losses of induction motors is presented, whereby each loss component is estimated separately. There is included a discussion of extra losses due to imperfection in workmanship. Calculated and test results on a few commercial machines are given as an indication of the reliability of this method."
"The insulating qualities of textiles vary with the amount of moisture present in them from hour to hour and are also strongly influenced by the amount of electrolytic material (salts, etc.) which the textiles contain. Electrolytic material may be washed out producing a commercially realizable increase in insulation resistance of the order of 50 times the original value. The resistance of the animal fibers, silk and wool, is far greater for a given moisture content than that of cotton or of cellulose acetate, a derivative of cotton. It appears probable that the distribution of water as well as the quantity is important and that the two classes of fibers are characterized by different space patterns according to which the water is distributed. It is suggested that the space distribution patterns are associated with the colloidal structures of the materials and in turn with their chemical classification as proteins and cellulose respectively. Cellulose acetate absorbs little water as compared with cotton and is correspondingly superior electrically. However its resistance varies with moisture content in the sam way as that of cotton."
"A baffling case of radio interference caused much distress to the citizens of Albert Lea, Minn., some time ago. The interference manifested itself as a continuous sound, obviously caused by a maintained arc. It was finally located by means of a portable set inside of a sleeve clamp connecting an aluminum to a copper conductor on a transmission line on the outskirts of the city. The hole in the connector for the reception of the aluminum conductor was fined with aluminum and the hole for the copper conductor was lined with copper. The man who installed the connector reversed it so that the contacts were between unlike, instead of like, metals. Corrosion occurred in the course of time, until finally an arcing contact was established. When the connector was replaced the interference ceased, thus terminating a prolific source of radio complaints. — Electrical World."
"The rapid growth of the Southeastern Power & Light system is noted. Long forecasts, operating methods and new plant designs are discussed briefly."
"High-speed circuit breakers have been used in both feeder and machine circuits of railway substations. It is the purpose of this paper to point out some of the advantages gained by placing this type of breaker in the feeder circuit and also to describe some of the more common types of feeder equipment using a well-known form of high-speed circuit breaker. A brief summary of the breaker characteristics is given, together with the results of short-circuit tests made on 600-volt reclosing feeders employing this type of breaker. The reclosing action is ordinarily obtained by means of a relay which, in conjunction with a load indicating resistor, measures the resistance of the external circuit. In order to permit feeder conditions to reach a stable value and particularly to enable all transient and counter e. m. f. effects to disappear before the reclosing devices are given control after the opening of the breaker, the action of this relay is purposely delayed. The latter effects usually disappear within a few seconds of the opening of the breaker on the usual type of railway circuits. In a majority of cases a time delay of 10 to SO seconds (after the opening of the breaker) elapses before the reclosing devices are given the control of the breaker. After this time delay has expired and load conditions have reached the desired value, the circuit breaker is reclosed. In some cases, especially for sectionalizing purposes, it has been found satisfactory to take the reclosing indication and control from the load side of the breaker. This feature requires that some other breaker undertake the reestablishment of voltage on the load circuit. By means of supervisory control the range of such equipment can be extended so as to pick up a dead section during abnormal operating conditions. A majority of 3000-volt installations has been made in connection with main line electrification where the desired reclosing operation is a combination of load-indicating and load-limiting functions. Voltage increments on the load of too large a value may increase the tractive effort to such values as to cause wheel slippage of the locomotive, or snapping of draw-bars; consequently the load voltage is raised in graduated steps by progressively short-circuiting portions of load-limiting resistors placed in the feeder circuit."
"Two automatic mercury-vapor rectifier substations having 3000-kw. 5000-ampere, 600-volt rectifiers are described in this paper. These rectifiers are the largest installed in this country. The reasons for the selection of this type of converting equipment instead of the rotary converter are enumerated. Information is given on the auxiliary apparatus and the control arrangement."
"WHILE there is still much to learn, lightning may be said to be now at least on an engineering basis since it is expressed numerically in volts and amperes. It has been removed from the realm of the “medicine man.”"
"Preliminary plans for the celebration of the centenary in 1931 of Faraday's epoch-making discoveries are reported by the Electrical World to have been made in London at a meeting of representatives of scientific, electrical and other societies held at the Royal Institution under the presidency of Sir Arthur Keith. The time chosen provisionally for the celebrations was the third week in September, 1931, and it was decided to set up two small committees, representing the scientific and industrial interests, to make the necessary plans and to insure that the celebrations shall be attended by interested persons from all parts of the world."
"This paper describes a new development in connection with bushing type current-transformer metering circuits, While this development utilizes the two-stage principle and has the same order of accuracy as that of two-stage current transformers, it is different from the conventional two-stage current transformers in that it does not require two-stage wattmeters and watthour meters, but may be used with any wattmeter or watthour meter. The principle and connections of the transformer are explained, and performance curves of a typical unit are given."
"IN the fact-finding stage of the studied movement to “develop, broaden, and enrich engineering education” which has been sponsored by the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education, the experiences and opinions of practising engineers have been an essential and an important contribution to the study. The study has resulted in a wealth of carefully analyzed information pertaining to the objectives of engineering education, to educational practises and results, and to the possible methods of broadening and enriching educational procedures."
"The potentiometer principle is well understood. Its application to the determination of the ratio and phase-angle accuracy of potential transformers is not new, but in unshielded form has been limited to about 66 kv. and in shielded form to about 33 kv. The paper describes a shielded potentiometer for 132 kv., which is designed for ultimate extension to 220 kv."

"The new Code for Standardization of Street Traffic Signs, Signals and Markings built up by a Sectional Committee wherein the American Institute of Electrical Engineers was represented has now been completed. It has been accepted by the American Engineering Council which participated during the past several years in the national conferences on street and highway safety inaugurated by Herbert Hoover when Secretary of Commerce. He cystallized consideration of the subject in a national conference on street and highway safety, in an effort to minimize the possibility of accidents and reduce the numerous loss of life and injuries resulting from accidents on the public streets and highways throughout the country. Surveys were made in 35 states and returns analyzed were collected in more than 100 cities and it is believed that the returns covering all conditions and methods of traffic control and regulation will show that this survey has been of great benefit. The final report of the Committee is now in circulation throughout the country by the American Engineering Council and efforts are being made to have the Standard Code inaugurated into laws in every state in the Union to standardize devices of every description for the regulation of traffic and safety on the public highways."
"The better types of industrial lighting installations today are characterized especially by two things; much higher levels of intensity, and reflecting equipment better suited to individual lighting problems so that glare is practically eliminated."
"In a recent address before the Boston Chamber of Commerce, President Atterbury, of the Pennsylvania Railroad strongly indorsed the purchase of electrical power for the use of electrified railroads rather than entering the power business for supplying their own properties. Speaking of the magnitude of the work of changing the motive power of the railroad, he said: “We worked out a jointly owned power-plant scheme with the United Gas Improvement Company and the Philadelphia Electric Company but decided not to go into it. Why should we enter the power business? We have no warrant to go into that business which is an industry by itself. By the time we are ready to use it we shall be buying power cheaper than we can make it ourselves and thereby saving a capital investment of from $20,000,000 to $30,000,000 over a great number of years.”"
"Engineering topics of live interest are on the program of the Regional Meeting of the South West District of the Institute in Dallas, Texas, May 7–9. Headquarters will be in the Adolphus Hotel. Four technical sessions are planned and there will also be two student sessions. Inspection trips, a most interesting lecture, a dinner-dance, etc., are other attractive events on the program."
"A Summer Convention which promises to equal any past Institute convention in excellence of technical discussion and in pleasurable entertainment is being planned for this year's meeting at Swampscott, Mass., June 24 to 28. The New Ocean House will be headquarters for the meeting. During the past six years, the progress of the electrical development in New England has made remarkable strides; the electrification of industry has created a multiplicity of opportunities for the study of advanced and diversified practise in the application of motors and control, modern lighting facilities, and industrial heating. Interconnection of tidewater steam paints and interior hydro plants by transmission lines has established a network of power supply; a pioneer rotary condenser operating in an atmosphere of hydrogen is in service in Pawtucket; the radio broadcasting stations, universities, colleges, and communication companies are preparing for engineering and historic trips which this richly developed region affords. In the technical will include tournaments for golf and tennis, a dinner, a reception, dancing, and a day's trip to York Beach."

"In the JOURNAL for January the proposal to establish test codes for electrical apparatus was mentioned. A further step has now been taken in this connection as the Standards Committee of the Institute at its meeting of February 27th directed that a committee should be appointed to make a survey of the situation. This action was taken following a report from the Electrical Machinery Committee expressing an opinion that the development of such electrical test codes would be a very valuable and desirable activity of the Institute. Chairman Newbury of the Standards Committee has appointed the special committee with the following personnel: F. M. Farmer, chairman and W. J. Foster, A. M. MacCutcheon, W. I. Slichter and E. C. Stone. This committee will report on the desirability, scope, general methods of work, probable expense and time involved in preparation of such codes."
"In the 1922 Edition of the A. I. E. E. Standards, Rule 16,000 “Values of A-C. Test Voltage for Household Devices” specifies a test of 500 volts at operating temperature for heating devices taking not over 660 watts and intended solely for operation on supply currents not exceeding 275 volts. This rule has never been replaced in the work of revision and in accordance with Standards procedure is therefore still applicable. In the opinion of the Standards Committee, because of the low value of test specified, the rule should be cancelled. An action recommending such action to the Board of Directors was taken and will come before the Board at its meeting of March 21."
"Following the cancellation of Rule 16,000, mentioned previously, the Standards Committee directed that a committee be appointed to investigate the field of both household and industrial electrical heating devices. The committee will report whether the Institute should undertake to develop such standards."
"Action was taken by the Standards Committee on February 27th recommending the publication as a Report on A. I. E. E. Standards of the report of the subcommittee of the Sectional Committee on Radio on “Graphical Symbols for Radio.” This report is now in preparation and will be available shortly."

"The report of the Council's Committee on Street Traffic Signs, Signals, and Markings is now off the press and is causing widespread interest and favorable comment. Many requests for copies are being received by L. W. Wallace, Executive Secretary. It is the ambition of the committee to have its recommendations carefully considered and adopted as a part of all national municipalities and in order to accomplish this the suggestions are made (a) that in each locality where there is a local engineering section, the president be supplied with a copy of the report with a recommendation that he in turn, through a local committee of his own, disseminate the information contained in the report; in communities where there is no local society, the local section of the national society would exercise this same method of information; in municipalities where there is neither local society nor local section, that there be an endeavor to organize a local section through some local engineer or civic organization. The Council offers to supply such local committee with a necessary number of reports and such other guidance as is required. It would appear that now, when traffic matters are so ultra important every community would benefit greatly by organizing to avail itself of this offer of the Council."

"A movement is now under way within the New York Section to divide the section membership into groups according to the field in which they are interested. At the present time four such groups are in view, namely; the Power group, the Communication, Transportation and Illumination groups. It is proposed that these individual groups will each hold a number of meetings during each administrative year for the presentation and discussion of papers of particular interest to them. The groups will be so arranged and divided into committees as to be able to handle completely their own meetings and affairs in general. This will provide an opportunity for a large number of Section members to take part in Section affairs, and permit also for wider discussion participated in by men who ordinarily do not get such opportunity at the large general monthly meetings. The monthly meetings on subjects of general interest to the entire Section membership will be continued. The Power group has set the date for its first meeting for April 10th and a program is being prepared. This group is under the chairmanship of George Sutherland of the New York and Queens Electric Light and Power Company. The chairman of the other three groups are as follows: H. S. Sheppard, Communication; T. R. Langan, Transportation; E. E. Dorting, Illumination."

"Continuing their plan of holding an annual joint meeting with a program supplied by students, the Los Angeles Section and California Institute of Technology and University of Southern California Branches met at the California Institute of Technology on the evening of March 5, 1929. During the early part of the evening, music was furnished by members of the Branches. After a dinner, the following program was presented:"
"Matt Pakkala, senior in electrical engineering at Montana State College, has been awarded the Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University, England. He was selected from a group of ten candidates from the colleges in the state of Montana, and will begin his work at Oxford next October to read for a degree in mathematics which he expects to receive after three years' study. Mr. Pakkala is the first student of Montana State College to receive the Rhodes Scholarship, and is considered to be the most brilliant mathematician who ever attended that school. The authorities at Oxford have granted him senior standing without examination."
"It is generally recognized that the great problem in the conduct of A. I. E. E. Student Branches is to secure a larger participation in the Branch affairs by the student members. The real solution is, doubtless, to make the meetings of sufficient interest to all the members that they will voluntarily be active. But how can the interest of the individual student be increased? How can meetings be conducted so that the members will derive the maximum benefit?"

"Severn D. Sprong, Manager of the Institute 1909–1912 and one of its Vice-Presidents 1912–14, is a native of Renssalaer County, New York. After completing the work of the common schools, he continued his studies for several years under special tutors. In 1893 he finished the General Electric Test and from then until 1898 served in various subordinate capacities in utility and special work. He then became Superintendent of the Electric Department of the Consolidated Gas Company of New Jersey at Long Branch, holding this position until 1900, when he was made Chief Engineer of the Central Electric Company, covering erection of central high-tension generating stations, transmission lines and four substations, — at Rahway, Perth Amboy, New Brunswick and Bound Brook, — replacing steam generating stations. Two years later he was chosen Assistant Chief Electrical Engineer of the New York Edison Company, remaining there until 1906, in responsible capacity engaged on the design of Waterside Station No. 2, numerous substations and transmission and distribution systems; also in the Williamsburgh Generating Station and several substations of the B. R. T. System, Brooklyn. From 1906 to 1909 he was associated with the design and construction of substations, transmission and distribution, and in charge of operations as Assistant Electrical Engineer for the United Electric Light & Power Company. Then for three years he was Chief Electrical and Mechanical Engineer for J. G. White & Company in charge of responsible direction of design and construction of numerous steam, hydro and transmission and distribution systems in the United States and Canada, also acting as advisor on various other projects along these lines. From the completion of this service until 1922 he was Chief Electrical Engineer for the Brooklyn Edison Company, in responsible charge of electrical engineering stations, substations, transmission and distribution, and all electrical construction of stations, substations, and street transmission and distribution; he was also in charge of the Meter Department and the purchase of all electrical machinery and equipment. From 1922 until 1925 he was Vice-President and General Manager of the Orange County Public Service Corporation, the Orange County Hydro Electric Corporation, Pike County Light & Power Company, and the Cape May Illuminating Company, in executive control of these properties including their development and operation, as well as the construction of hydroelectric plants. He was also President of the Port Jervis Traction Company during this period. This entire group of properties included also three gas plants and the distribution systems."

"This paper briefly reviews the history of electricity as motive power for oil pipe line operation and notes some of the reasons for, and the results of, its rapid development in the Southwest. Some attention is paid to the method of serving these loads from transmission lines and the tendency of modern pipe line practise is shown. The last five years have seen rapid advances in the methods of underground transportation of petroleum and the paper reviews some of the present tendencies in design of the modern oil pipe line station."
"The object of this paper is to present a description of the Dallas, (Texas,) underground network system. This system is of interest since it is directly opposed to the general trend of furnishing non-standard voltages in underground systems. The reasons for its selection and its advantages over the three-phase four-wire system are presented. A brief description of the installation of equipment in vaults and manholes is given. Another feature of this system is the use of standard reactance transformers together with an external reactor, shunted by a fuse, for purposes of overload protection to the transformers. In addition to the regular network this system has a single-wire manhole and vault lighting network which is also used as as a control wire for turning on and off multiple street lamps. Another feature of this system is a complete underground telephone system with a telephone outlet in each manhole and transformer vault. This telephone system is also connected to float switches in transformer vaults which automatically notify the trouble office in the event of high water in a transformer vault. The routine tests made in connection with the operation of the network system are described and the method of locating primary faults is given in detail. Complete records are kept of the installation of conduit and cable. Photographic records of construction, operation, and cable failures, etc., are also kept. The record of this network system both as to efficiency and as to continuity of service is excellent."

"The Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Boston has adopted a policy of numerous relatively small automatic a-c. substations located at the various individual load centers, this policy being enhanced by the development of a new method of automatic control and by the standardization of the station design. The rating of a substation is based on the sum of three specially designed transformers each having an inherent 50 per cent overload capacity. Thus, the maximum load is normally carried by the three units operating at their nominal 100 per cent rating, but in emergencies the load can be handled by two banks, the transformer out of service, representing only 33 per cent of the station capacity instead of 50 per cent as in the usual case. The automatic control consists essentially of load-current relays which switch in or out the follow-up transformers as needed. This operating point for maximum station efficiency equals $\\sqrt {{2 \\times core\\ losses\\ per\\ bank \\over copper\\ losses}}$. Serious trouble on any bank will bring in the succeeding transformer. Each transformer has its own sequence switch so that it may be made leading, follow-up, second following, or manual, irrespective of the set-up for the remaining units. The simplicity of this control equipment is particularly interesting, in fact only the current control and one auxiliary relay are directly chargeable to the automatic control. The circuits and apparatus have several special features promoting safety and reliability. The construction of these stations has been standardized by the development of standard “blocks” complete in themselves and suitable for being arranged or added, as desired. Thus, for each transformer section there are four types of blocks — high-tension, low-tension, regulator and switchboard. Such an arrangement offers the advantages of complete segregation of equipment, flexibility in station layout, efficient provision for growth, standardization of engineering and construction, and the satisfactory use of complete bills of material. This system of control and standardization of construction has been applied to five new automatic transformer substations in the last two years, and the results have been very satisfactory."
"This paper presents the results of investigations made to explain the wide differences found between dielectric loss measurements made on full-reel lengths of cable and on samples (10 ft. net length) removed from these reels. At least one source of such differences is found in losses occurring at the ends of the cable, these losses being insignificant in the case of the full reel but amounting to as much as 100 per cent of the loss in the normal sample. Methods of determining, controlling and eliminating these end losses are described."
"A new method of radio-telephonic conversation between a moving train and a stationary instrument is announced from Canada, where it has been successfully carried out on the Canadian National Railway lines. The new device throws the voice from the train to the telegraph wires which line the right-of-way of every railroad. It is then carried to the terminal point and there connected with the ordinary telephone lines. This process is reversed as regards the other participant in the conversation. As the system now stands, the terminal points must be not more than about 150 miles apart or the voice is lost. A two-hour conversation was held in this way on May 5, and several points of advantage over the German system are claimed. Experiments in perfecting the system were carried on by J. C. Burkholder, formerly with the Bell laboratory at Newark, N. J. Electrical World."
"In electric power stations it is often necessary to make accurate measurements of current or power when the instruments are located near to the cables carrying large alternating currents. The magnetic field produced by these currents may constitute a serious source of error in the measurements unless careful precautions are taken to guard against such disturbing effects. This paper summarizes the various principles and methods for detecting and minimizing the errors which may arise from this source. The principal methods are: (1) To so arrange the cables carrying the large currents that they produce as little stray magnetic effect as possible; (2) to use instruments of the shielded or of the astatic type; (3) to repeat readings with the instrument connections reversed; and (4) to avoid all loops in the connecting leads."
"The measurement of dielectric loss in high-voltage cables presents many problems which are not simple, and their solution is obtained only after considerable effort and research. This paper presents some of the problems that the authors have encountered in this type of work, together with the methods used for their solution. The bridge method, which is used for the measurement of dielectric loss, is described in some detail. Details of the auxiliary equipment, such as galvanometer, amplifier, air condenser, shielding and special methods of bringing the shielding to the proper potential are also given. If accurate results are to be had in dielectric-loss measurements, the entire bridge, including cable, air condenser, and leads must be properly shielded, and the capacitance between leads and shielding should be made small. It is entirely insufficient to shield the bridge and ground the shielding directly. At times, shielding cables may increase the measured losses. In measuring the capacitance of the air condenser, all stray capacitance to its guard rings and to surroundings must be eliminated. The voltage across the voltmeter coil of a high-voltage transformer is frequently taken as a measure of the voltage across its secondary. In some methods of measurement, this voltmeter-coil circuit is an integral part of the measuring circuits. Methods of measuring the ratio of primary to secondary voltage and the phase angle between them are described, and in the complete paper considerable quantitative data are given for typical testing transformers under various conditions of load. The accuracy of the bridge as a power-measuring device may be determined by inserting known resistances into its arms and comparing computed results with observed results. Due to unsuspected leakage and stray-capacitance currents, however, the introduction of such resistances may cause large errors. Methods of minimizing such currents are given, as are analyses of proper and improper methods of making such measurements and observed data and results. Harmonics probably do not introduce error in this type of measurement, but at times they are troublesome in that they produce anomalous effects in the measuring apparatus."
"Electrical measuring apparatus is shielded and guarded to protect it from the following external influences; namely, leakage currents, electrostatic fields, magnetic fields, and electromagnetic waves. Apparatus is guarded against leakage currents which may flow over or through the solid insulators on which the apparatus is supported. It is shielded against leakage currents which flow through the fluid in which the instrument is immersed. By a proper arrangement of guards and shields any apparatus can be completely protected against leakage currents. Any apparatus can be completely shielded from electrostatic fields by placing it in a metallic case. However, there may be electrostatic reactions between the apparatus and the shield, thus introducing errors in the measuring apparatus. Shielding apparatus from magnetic fields requires that the apparatus be surrounded by a thick enclosure of magnetic material. The theory of this magnetic shielding has been developed and formulas for producing the most satisfactory shielding are given. The shielding of an apparatus from electromagnetic waves is largely accomplished by means of eddy currents which these waves set up in the shield. The theory for the production of these eddy currents has been developed and the best location of shields is discussed. Some attention is given to the errors which may be introduced by shielding and some methods are outlined for obviating the necessity of shielding."
"This is a description of an automatic block signal system used on single track. Signals are located over or to right of track governed. Cab signals are a development of recent years. Indications must be easy to read. Three colors are used — red, yellow, and green. Signals are dependent upon track circuits for proper control and operation. Energy for operation is supplied by storage batteries trickle charged from commercial sources of alternating current. Current for lamps is taken directly from a-c. lines with automatic cut over to storage batteries in case of failure of supply line. Lens unit of light signal is a doublet combination with a special lens for use on curves. Absolute permissive block system provides head-on protection from station to station and permits following movements with clear signals with intermediate blocks between stations. Tonnage markers permit heavy trains to pass red signals on grades where, if stopped, these trains could not be started. Signal circuits are designed on the closed circuit principle. An organization for construction and maintenance of a Signal Department is outlined."
"This paper describes two types of electrical analyzers which have been developed for the direct measurement of harmonic components of voltage and current on power and telephone systems. These devices are assembled mechanically in a form suitable for use in either the laboratory or in the field. Both instruments, which differ chiefly with respect to sensitivity and input circuit arrangement, employ multistage vacuum tube amplifiers and two duplicate interstage selective circuits. The power circuit analyzer is designed to measure harmonic voltages in the frequency range from 75 to 3000 cycles, and over a voltage range from 0.5 millivolt to 50 volts. The telephone circuit analyzer operates over the same frequency range and measures harmonic currents as low as 0.05 microampere and voltages as small as 0.005 millivolt. Both analyzers are adapted to measure small harmonic voltages and currents in the presence of the fundamental component and other harmonics relatively large in magnitude. A number of devices are described which have been adopted for eliminating various sources of error. The paper presents in detail the characteristics of both instruments with respect to selectivity, sensitivity, linearity, balance of input with respect to ground, generation of harmonics and susceptiveness to stray fields."

"Interconnected electric service in the Southwest has kept pace with the country as a whole. Eight states are now connected by a continuous transmission system, operated at a voltage of 60,000 volts or more. This system extends 720 mi. from East to West and 810 mi. from North to South. A description of the system is given in this paper."
"An appreciable saving may be made in construction of overhead distribution systems by the use of bare conductors in the place of weatherproof conductors. The reliability of the system will be considerably increased with lower maintenance and operation costs. Bare conductors have practically unlimited life and when removed can be reinstalled as new wire resulting in a reduction of depreciation. This paper outlines the advantages of using bare wires and gives also advantages of medium-hard-drawn as compared with annealed conductors."
"The paper discusses the operating characteristics of large commutators. It is pointed out that initially many cases of blackened and burned bars are caused by a slight roughness which causes irregular commutation and a slight sparking which when once started gradually becomes worse. The requirements of the surface of a high-speed commutator are discussed, showing that radial variations of the order of one ten-thousandth of an inch between adjacent bars may give serious trouble. Some causes of roughness are discussed, showing that temperature is a major factor, but that redesigning the commutator to reduce the temperature does not necessarily cure the trouble, and may actually give poorer performance. Some methods of commutator testing are described with typical records showing the performance of various types of construction. The question of safe temperature limits is then discussed. It is maintained that the question of the permissible temperature limits is entirely unlike that of insulated windings, since the materials used are not injured by temperatures considerably above the present limits. The permissible limit of a commutator is determined by its mechanical construction. Low temperature limits may lead to illogical designs, since large heat dissipating surfaces are required which may give higher stresses and larger expansion effects, which may be more harmful than higher temperatures. A temperature limit based on operating characteristics would be more satisfactory."
"Light therapy, or more properly speaking, radiation therapy, has for some years been a useful tool in the hands of physicians. It is rapidly coming into popular favor. Countless home treatment devices have been placed on the market and are in use. The effectiveness of radiation therapy, when intelligently used, has been demonstrated by a vast accumulation of evidence."
"A census taken about the first of February 1929 shows that of some 60 or more pictures in the process of being photographed, approximately 60 per cent were being made with incandescent lamps, an increase from 25 per cent as of July 1, 1928. The general practise of the studios has been to make their sound pictures entirely with incandescent lamps and to use the former illuminants for the silent pictures."

"An outstanding success among regional meetings of the In stitute was the meeting, held under the auspices of District No. 7 at the Adolphus Hotel, Dallas, Texas, May 7–9. The registered attendance of 541 is remarkable in a locality where travel distances are great, where the total membership of the District, which includes six states, is only 630 and the membership of the Dallas Section is only about 100. The interest of those attending was maintained throughout the meeting as indicated by the fact that the attendance at the technical sessions was never less than 325. At an address on the evening of May 7, there were 750 present, many of whom were not registered in the regular attendance records. One noteworthy feature was that about 200 members of Branches were present to take part in the Student division of the program."

"In 1923 the “mile of standard cable” was replaced in the Bell System by a new unit for expressing telephone transmission efficiencies and levels. At that time, the generic term “transmission unit” was taken to designate this new unit, since it was considered desirable to defer the adoption of a more distinctive name until this unit had been given further consideration by others who would have use for a unit of this type. This new unit is defined by the statement that two amounts of power differ by one transmission unit when they are in the ratio of 10.1, and any two amounts of power differ by N transmission units when they are in the ratio of 10N(.1). In accordance with this, the number of transmission units corresponding to the ratio of any two powers is ten times the common logarithm of that ratio."
"This paper discusses the method of presenting in the curricula of engineering schools the fundamental electrical principles, emphasizing the desirability of presenting them as far as practical in a general way and of making clear the relations of specific applications, such as the relation between circuit theory equations as applied to power systems and to telephone systems, and the relation between ordinary circuit theory and the generalized electromagnetic equations. An outline is given of some interesting problems arising and results obtained in the application of electric principles to telephone systems."
"This paper describes the magnetic properties of a group of iron-nickel-cobalt alloys, named “perminvar.” With certain heat treatments these alloys have unusual constancy of permeability and extremely small hysteresis losses at low flux densities, and peculiarly shaped hysteresis loops constricted in the middle as the maximum flux densities of the loops are increased. Methods of preparing and heat treating the alloys are described, limits of composition, and changes in the magnetic properties with composition and with different heat treatments are illustrated. A theory of constitutional changes effected by heat treatment and responsible for the unusual magnetic properties is suggested."
"In this paper the anodic film-forming properties of aluminum are discussed and the unique electrical qualities of film-coated aluminum anodes are described. Special reference is made to an aluminum electrolytic condenser of the type used in low pass electric wave-filters of direct-current telephone power plant equipment. Electrical characteristics of condensers are given and the manner is described in which the operation and life of the units are influenced by variations in composition of the electrodes and the electrolyte."
"Scattering of light is one of the commonest of all phenomena, which does not in the least imply that it is one of the most commonplace. Even its practical importance entitles it to high respect. We are often told that were it not for scattering, the sky would not be blue; the sun and the stars would stand out amazingly brilliant against a background black as coal. It is probable, however, that if scattering were suddenly to be suspended, the disappearance of the sky would be one of the least of our worries. Everything else would disappear, except what was self-luminous. The visible world would consist of the sun, the other stars, and flames, some electrical discharges, the filaments of incandescent lamps, and some substances glowing feebly with fluorescence or phosphorescence. Nothing else could be seen except as a silhouette, apart from objects so translucent that they could be viewed as a stereopticon slide against a flame. Happily no such calamity impends; and we may unconcernedly consider the theoretical importance of the process, which is great. As some might say, the scattering of light is one of the battlegrounds between the undulatory and the corpuscular theories. Metaphors of combat are however not appropriate; it is necessary to reconcile the theories, not to smash one or the other. Now it happens that some of the phenomena of scattering may be interpreted by the one theory, and some by the other; and some can be explained by either, which is most auspicious; for if this can some day be said of all the phenomena of light, the goal of our desires will have been attained."
"In certain transmission problems principally those relating to induction and interference phenomena, it is necessary to know the transmission characteristics of a circuit composed of an underground wire with earth return. These can be evaluated by well known engineering formulas provided the ground return impedance is known. The present paper gives the mathematical solution of this problem and shows that the ground return impedance is substantially independent of the depth of the wire below the surface."
"The numerical evaluation of the incomplete Binomial Summation, a problem of major importance for many statistical and engineering applications of the Theory of Probability, is a question for which a satisfactory solution has not as yet been obtained. Several approximation formulas have been presented.2 each of which gives good results for some limited range of values of the variables involved; but a formula of wide applicability is still a desideratum."
"A new method for obtaining transient solutions of electrical networks is developed in this paper which depends upon the fact that a distortionless line can be made to approach as a limit all three of the circuit elements, resistance, inductance and capacity. The process of solution consists in solving for the current in a distortionless line — which is ordinarily a simple process — and then proceeding to the limiting case of the distortionless line which approaches the element or elements of interest. Some examples are worked out and a derivation of the Laplacian integral solution is given. It is interesting to note that this method gives a formal solution of the Laplacian integral equation."
"Certain difficulties encountered in acoustic measurements of the performance of loud speakers are described. Because of the nature of these difficulties it has not yet been possible to specify a complete and simple set of measurements or conditions which will completely express the performance of a loud speaker. Data are given showing the performance of two representative types of loud speakers both when measured in outdoor space free from reflections and when measured under varying conditions in a specially treated acoustic laboratory. The differences serve to emphasize the importance of certain precautions in the making of indoor acoustic measurements."
"This paper considers chiefly the frequency-response characteristics and limitations of the lateral cut “wax” record. It shows that the frequency range from 30 to 8,000 cycles can be recorded and reproduced from the record with practically negligible deviation from a flat frequency-response characteristic. The paper brings out the ease with which the record can immediately be replayed from the “wax” as an aid in assisting the artist to obtain the best results. A brief description is given of commercial processing methods including both plating and pressing. These methods give essentially a perfect copy of the original “wax.” The time required far this work has been considerably reduced of late so that a test pressing can be obtained within three hours of the cutting of the original “wax.”"
"The light valve developed by Bell Telephone Laboratories is an electromagnetic shutter consisting of a loop of duralumin tape formed into a slit at right angles to a magnetic field. Sound currents from the microphone and amplifier flow in this loop causing it to open and close in accordance with the current variations."
"The reproduction of the synchronized sound picture of today presents no serious problem of synchronization, for this factor has been practically eliminated by the perfection of electrical means for reproducing sound with equipment which may be coupled mechanically to the picture projector."
"The general problem involved in the design of a system suitable to be used to record and reproduce sounds such as are required for “talking” motion pictures is outlined. The general method of attack is indicated. There follows a description of the several pieces of apparatus which comprise the theatre equipment, including a discussion of some of their salient features and of the part each plays in the sound projector system."

"The experiments by the author and L. H. Germer, by G. P. Thomson and by others from which the wave properties of electrons are adduced are briefly described. The agreement between the results of these experiments and the prediction of L. de Broglie is pointed out. The wave and corpuscular properties of electrons are compared with the similar properties of light quanta."
"The insulating qualities of textiles vary with the amount of moisture present in them from hour to hour and are also strongly influenced by the amount of electrolytic material (salts, etc.) which the textiles contain. Electrolytic material may be washed out producing a commercially realizable increase in insulation resistance of the order of 50 times the original value."
"This paper outlines methods by which silk and cotton insulation can be purified and improved. It gives the results of tests on the insulation properties of these materials before and after purification and explains the testing procedures. One of the findings is that the purified cotton may be substituted for ordinary commercial silk."
"This article describes the types of springs employed in telephone apparatus and enumerates the engineering requirements both from the standpoint of mechanics and the quality of materials desired. The chemical and physical requirements of the spring materials are given. The importance of fatigue is emphasized and the endurance limit is given for spring brass, nickel silver and phosphor bronze."
"In applying telegraph transmission measuring apparatus to the development and maintenance of telegraph circuits, it is desirable to correlate quantitative measurements of telegraph signal distortion with quality of telegraph transmission. Accordingly, a series of tests has been carried out in order to determine this relationship for the case of manual operation using the American Morse Code. These tests are described and the results, together with the conclusions reached, are given in summarized form."
"In this paper apparatus for observing hysteresis loops of magnetic materials is described. It combines a cathode ray oscillograph with a vacuum tube amplifier and an electrical integrating circuit consisting of condenser and resistance. The device describes the B-H curve for alternating magnetization in the frequency range of five to perhaps several thousand periods per second. The specimens may be either long strips or closed rings. Alternating flux as low as one maxwell may be readily observed."
"Transmission considerations and practical limitations indicate that in the lower frequency range, frequencies near 60 kc are best suited for transatlantic radio-telephone transmission. A radio receiving location in Maine gives a signal-to-noise ratio improvement over a New York location equivalent to increasing the power of the British transmitter about 50 times."
"In this paper, oscillographs developed for recording transient phenomena are described which obtain automatically records of amplitude, wave form, frequency, duration, and time of any electrical disturbance for which they are adapted. Two instruments are described for recording very short or very long transients: these may be used in combination. At power frequencies satisfactory records may be made on film or sensitized paper with a two-watt lamp. The instruments and their performance are illustrated by photographs and oscillograms."
"This is an elementary introduction to the phenomena of diffraction of waves by crystals, one of the most striking and important discoveries of the last twenty years of physics. These phenomena have proved that X-rays and electrons are partly of the nature of waves, and have supplied the best available methods of measuring their wave-lengths; while on the other hand, the study of the diffraction-pattern of a crystalline substance makes it possible to determine the arrangement and the interrelations of the atoms with a precision and fullness heretofore unimagined, which has already yielded knowledge of great value in all the fields of science and promises immeasurably more."
"Scattering of Quanta with Diminution of Frequency1 Karl K. Darrow. In this article the author points out that certain phenomena of X-rays recently reported were illustrations of the general process of scattering of light with change in frequency, which had just begun to attract attention owing to important observations made by Raman and others with visible and ultra-violet light. The can tent was amplified and restated in Dr. Darrow's article entitled “Contemporary Advances in Physics, XVII-The Scattering of Light with Change of Frequency,” which appeared in the January, 1929, issue of the Bell System Technical Journal."
"This paper outlines some of the general considerations which must be taken into account in setting up any practical sampling inspection plan. An economical method of inspection is developed in detail for the case where the purpose of the inspection is to determine the acceptability of discrete lots of a product submitted by a producer. By employing probability theory, the method places a definite barrier in the path of material of defective quality and gives this protection to the consumer with a minimum of inspection expense."
"In drawing conclusions as to the reliability of the mean of a sample it is important that all relevant information be taken into consideration. The mathematical analysis in this paper is based on the Laplacian Bayes Theorem which implicitly comprehends the results of a sample together with the a priori knowledge available concerning the parameters of the universe."
"The paper is chiefly concerned with the important speech power quantities — frequency spectra, distributions of instantaneous, average, syllabic and peak amplitudes, etc. — as they obtain in actual speech for a large range of voices, talking levels, and subject matters. The analysis is not nearly so complete nor so fine-grained as that which, in principle, can be derived from oscillographic records of individual speech sounds. Its advantage is in the speed with which data can be secured, under widely varying conditions and on a scale which warrants statistical conclusions. Some of the methods in use for measurements of this type are described. A “level analyzer” has been developed, primarily for the measurement of average and peak pressure amplitudes in speech and music, both as to magnitude and as to position in the frequency spectrum. Illustrative results are given for samples of speech, music and noise."
"The analysis of the radiation from dipoles as given hy Sommerfeld and by von Hoerschelmann is deficient in one respect: it does not give the true1 asymptotic expressions for the radiation leaving at a considerable angle from the horizontal. The correct asymptotic formulas have already heen easily supplied by an appeal to the Reciprocal Theorem; lately M. J. O. Strutt2 has got them directly from the boundary conditions and H. Weyl3 has derived the correct asymptotic formula for a vertical dipole at the surface of the earth by a method quite different from Sommerfeld's. In the present paper it is shown how they can be got by merely improving the rigor of Sommerfeld's analysis."
"The atomic or “kinetic” theory of gases, with its interpretations of such qualities as temperature, pressure, viscosity and conductivity, has ranked for more than half a century as a very important part of theoretical physics. A corresponding theory for radiation and for negative electricity is much to be desired, since it is known that in many ways each of these entities behaves as though it were atomic. There are, however, differences among the three, and only within the last five years have these been formulated suitably. This article is devoted to the resulting statistical theories."
"This paper covers an investigation which was undertaken to secure a simple and reliable method of test for sheet non-ferrous metals. An account of the early development work leading to the adoption of the Rockwell hardness tester for a preliminary inspection of sheet metals and the tensile test as the basic test to be referred to in case the Rockwell test results were near to or outside the established Rockwell limits for a given lot of material was published in 1927.1 The continuation of this work including establishment of test limits for four grades of brass and for two grades each of nickel silver and phosphor bronze will be published this year.2"
"This paper is chiefly concerned with the technique of making articulation tests. The construction of a syllabic testing list, the selection of a testing crew, the methods of comparing articulation data for various crews, and the significance of the test as a measure of the speech capabilities of a system are discussed. Various types of lists for different uses are also discussed."
"Reciprocal Theorems in Radio Communication.1 JOHN R. CARSON. Two reciprocal theorems, the generalized Rayleigh theorem and the Sommerfeld-Pfrang theorem, are of great theoretical importance in radio communication. A careful analysis of these theorems and their mathematical derivations shows that they are quite distinct and their practical fields of application different. In particular it shows that the Sommerfeld-Pfrang theorem labors under restrictions, implicit in its mathematical derivation, which seriously limit its field of practical applicability."
"Recent investigations of magnetic properties of alloys of iron, nickel and cobalt have resulted in the discovery of materials of remarkable magnetic properties previously unknown. In a brief review, early experiments that led to the discovery of these materials and the magnetic properties of the entire field are discussed. Those groups of alloys of outstanding scientific and technical importance such as the permalloys and the perminvars and special heat treatment required for development of special magnetic properties are taken up in detail. A theory is suggested to account for some of the magnetic characteristics, and a few of the practical applications of these materials are described."
"A homogeneous beam of electrons is directed at 45° incidence against a {111}-face of a nickel crystal. The beam regularly reflected from this face impinges upon a second similar face at the same incidence angle. A Faraday collector is set to receive electrons regularly reflected from the second crystal, but only such electrons are accepted into the collector as have survived the two reflections without appreciable loss of kinetic energy. The collector and second crystal are rigidly joined, and may be rotated about the axis of the beam proceeding from the first to the second crystal. Measurements of the intensity of the twice reflected beam have been made at bombarding potentials from 10 to 160 volts. Within this range selective reflections (intensity maxima) are observed at 20, 55, 77, 103 and 120 volts."
"The expansion theorem is one of the most frequently used methods of evaluating operational Forms arising from the operational calculus developed by Heaviside. The original theorem, however, is applicable, in general, only to expressions containing integral powers of the operator d/dt. This paper describes an extension to, or a generalization of the original expansion theorem whereby, in general, operational forms with either fractional or integral powers of the operator can be evaluated. A number of operational equivalents are given to be used with the theorem, one of which is the equivalent used by Heaviside. Examples of the application of the theorem to electric circuit problems are shown."
"A new standard of frequency is described in which three 100,000 cycle quartz crystal-controlled oscillators of very high constancy are employed. These are interchecked automatically and continuously with a precision of about one part in one hundred million. They are checked daily in terms of radio time signals by the usual method employing a clock controlled by current maintained at a submultiple of the crystal frequency. Specially shaped crystals are used which have been adjusted to have temperature coefficients less than 0.0001 per cent per degree C."
"The characteristics of piezoelectric quartz crystal plates of the perpendicular or Curie cut are compared with parallel or 30-degree cut plates with reference to the type of vibration of the most active modes, the frequency of these modes as a function of the dimensions, and the magnitude and sign of the temperature coefficients of these frequencies."
"The telephone transmission system described here is the Master Reference System of the Bell System for the expression of transmission standards and the ratings of the transmission performance of telephone circuits. The transmitter and receiver elements of this system are reference standards for the ratings of the transmitting and receiving performance of terminal station sets."
"In this paper the purpose and usefulness of shielding in high-frequency measurement are outlined. General principles of electrostatic shielding are developed as applied to simple impedances and to networks of impedances, particularly to bridge networks. Practical applications of these principles to the shielding of adjustable impedances, and in the construction of actual bridge circuits, are described."
"The paper describes the development of a fatigue test machine for sheet metals and gives results of fatigue tests on five alloys of alpha brass, one alloy of nickel silver, one alloy of phosphor bronze and Everdur. The results indicate that cold work raises the endurance limit but not proportionally to the increase in tensile strength produced by the same cause."
"Under appropriate experimental conditions, electron scattering by a single crystal of nickel can give rise to diffraction patterns of four quite distinct types. We attribute one of these patterns to the space lattice of the nickel crystal, one to the topmost layer of nickel atoms, one to a monatomic layer of adsorbed gas atoms, and one to a thick layer of gas atoms. From these phenomena some conclusions concerning gas adsorption have been drawn. We have at hand a new and important method of crystal analysis."
"Relation of Nitrogen to Blue Heat Phenomena in Iron Gild Dispersion-Hardening in the System Iron-Nitrogen.1 R. S. DEAN. R. O. DAY and J. L GREGG. It has been generally observed that iron, as an outstanding exception among metals, increases its hardness and strength by low-temperature annealing after cold work. and also by increase of testing temperature to the range of 150° C. to 300° C. This investigation was made with the object of ascertaining if similar phenomena were observed in high purity iron and. if not, to the presence of which impurities these phenomena could he traced, After describing the tests made and giving the results. the authors come to the conclusion that commercial irons owe their property of hardening hy reheating after cold work, as well as their increase in tensile strength in the range 100° C. to 300° C., to the solution of small amounts of iron-nitride present."
"Actinic—Having the property, possessed especially by the shorter wave lengths of the spectrum, of effecting chemical changes as in photography."
"Section 5 of the Constitution and By-Laws, which was revised to read as follows, and which was circularized in printed form to members before the Spring Convention, was voted upon and ratified at the business session on Monday, May 6, 1929, of the Spring Convention of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers."
"The old road has been electrified and it is not, paradoxically, as easy to travel as it was when steam was the rule. With the dawn really coming up like thunder and with ham and eggs sizzling on the Transvox screen of the Roxy, the press agent has his troubles. He is asked,—and the answer must be ready,—“Was that really Rin-Tin-Tin that barked?” He coins names like “talkies”, “audible cinema” and “non-sinks”, and he does not always pick the term that is most descriptive. He must decide whether to publicize the fact that those swords didn't clash in the reconstructed palace of Louis but that Hugo Reisenfeld's musicians tapped some teacups with spoons inside the Trinity Baptist Church in Camden, N. J. He must take the blame for making audiences conscious of mechanical contrivances while they are seeing and hearing productions that aim to achieve an emotional effect; it is undoubtedly true that in the magnificent job of publicizing sound devices publicity departments went beyond the life lines and planted the whirling discs and the tiny sound tracks in the mind's eye of every moviegoer."
"The necessity of eliminating all extraneous noises in sound recording Cinematographic work is self evident and too well known to warrant the entering into any discussion on it."
"The printing of sound pictures on a rapid basis is, of course, only possible by a continuous machine, and the possibility of a rapid continuous machine being used has been greatly enhanced by having a suitable automatic light control. This, we believe, is the advantage of the machine we are trying to develop over a slower method of manual control or a limited automatic control. The fact that both sound tract and picture printing light, should be controlled by automatic means gives our very large capacity, automatic control a chance to demonstrate its worth in the art."
"In this age of diversification it is to be expected that different individuals and different groups will have different ideas regarding the methods which should be followed to produce the results they have in mind. This condition exists to an unusual degree in the motion picture industry, and it may, therefore, be presumptuous on my part to attempt a description of a typical sound studio recording installation. I shall, however, attempt to place before you not only some typical studio layouts but to bring also to your attention a few of the factors which have influenced the design of these layouts."
"The qualifications of a monitor man are far greater in scope than is generally conceded. They include practical experience and a generous knowledge of subjects never touched upon when this individual is discussed openly or otherwise around the movie lots. His work has a definite relation to engineering, yet he is not wholly engineer; it has a perpetual relation to photography, yet surely he is not a photographer; most certainly it has an inseparable relation to acting, and just as certainly he is not an actor, though directors frequently call him a bad actor. He is not a mechanic. He is not a freak. He is merely a human being with a past—that is to say, his past experience makes him what he is today and fits him for his job. In fact, the value of a monitor is determined by his training prior to the advent of the Talkies plus his ability to apply himself. The man under discussion cannot be born over night nor can he be developed in a week or a month."
"At the risk of boring you, if you know more about my subject than the usual gathering, even of engineers, I will approach my subject from a historical standpoint. How frequently we hear of businesses and industries which have been founded on patents. They range from telephones to safety razors, from air brakes to garment fasteners. In countless industries patents have been an important factor, if not the most important factor, in determining the growth and success of the business."
"In the days of Pharoah in the making of brick, straw was necessary and when straw was denied the Hebrews, they could not make brick, not withstanding the demands of the King. Today many exhibitors of motion pictures are demanding high grade results upon the screens of their theatres, and at the same time failing or refusing to keep their projection equipment either up to date or in a good state of repair. They apparently do not know that it is just as impossible to produce high grade projection results with old equipment in a poor state of repair, or even with up to date equipment in poor condition, as it was for the men of the time of King Pharoah to produce bricks without the necessary straw to bind the clay together."
"Positive motion picture film on tinted support has been available for many years. It has been used extensively; in fact during some periods within the past few years eighty to ninety per cent of the total production has been printed on tinted positive film. There is little doubt that the employment of material which imparts a pleasing and variable color to the screen adds to the beauty of the production, breaks the monotony of looking for long periods at a plain black and white picture, and softens harsh outlines which otherwise may produce unpleasant impressions. But of much greater importance than these rather incidental aesthetic contributions of color is its great potential power to enhance, by either objective or subjective association, the emotional significance of the scene with which it is associated. It must be admitted that the language of color—the more or less precise evaluation of the emotional value of the various hues, tints, and shades—is at present in a very rudimentary stage, of evolution. Correlations are in many cases subconsciously felt without being consciously defined. It is entirely possible, and in fact probable, that careful study and experimentation may lead to the development of this language or symbolism into a powerful emotional tool in the hands of the master motion picture dramatist."
"The machine used in recording sounds on phonograph discs synchronously with associated pictures consists essentially of a turntable, bearing the “wax” and rotated by a synchronous motor of constant speed, and an electricity driven stylus cutting the word. In the design of this machine the primary aim is to ensure that the record is both faithful to the original sounds and synchronous with the pictures. Fidelity in the performance of the stylus would be vitiated by departures from uniformity in the speed of the turntable while sounds were being recorded or reproduced. Although a constant speed motor is used, its value would be destroyed if the machinery transmitting the drive motor to turntable were not equally free of velocity variations. Thus the problem of fidelity involves not only the motor and the stylus but all the moving parts of the machine."
"The Western Electric theatre reproducing machine provides for reproducing sound from both disc and film records in synchronism with the showing of motion pictures."
"Motion picture engineers will understand better perhaps than electrical engineers the necessity for what has been termed “dubbing.” The entire realm of trick photography and duping as a necessary adjunct to editing of the silent motion picture now has its counterpart in sound production in this process. Dubbing may be subdivided and classified as follows: (1) “Scoring,” or adding music to a picture that may or may not already have dialogue or sound; (2) “Synchronizing,” or adding new sound effects or dialogue in synchronism with a picture which has previously been photographed with or without sound. (3) “Re-recording,” or transferring a film or disc record to a new film or disc record by the electrical process originally used."
"With the introduction into theatres of equipment for reproducing sound in conjunction with the presentation of motion pictures, it was evident that the sound projector system might also be used for other purposes. Some of these special uses were referred to in Part No. 1 of a paper by Seriven and Santee, entitled “Western Electric Sound Projector Systems for Use in Motion Picture Theatres,” which was presented before this Society at Lake Placid last September. It is the purpose of this paper to outline these special applications in more detail and to describe briefly the apparatus which is furnished with Western Electric Sound Projector Systems for adapting them to these special uses."
"The problems met in installing sound picture projection equipment in theatres have been covered in a previous paper presented before this society. Upon completion of a theatre installation the question of maintenance or service comes to the fore. As in other industries, an up-to-date service policy contemplates the maintenance by periodical inspection of all parts of the system in the best possible condition. Most troubles are, through the intelligent application of the service policy, detected and remedied before becoming sufficiently advanced to seriously effect reproduction or result in a shut down."
"One of the early motion picture spectacles was created by buying two old locomotives and having them crash together in a head-on collision. The engineers had pulled open the throttles and jumped prior to the impact. A couple of empty engines butting each other will not suffice today. The human element must be included in the shot. You must appear to maim at least one engineer and strew the track with the injured, or the option on your employment contract will not be renewed."
"The filming of a successful photoplay calls for mechanical skill of the highest order, not only in the picture itself, but in equipment used in conjunction with it. This equipment the public seldom sees, the effects only being shown on the screen; but without such equipment, the photoplay could not possibly be the finished product exhibited in theatres today."
"Television requires apparatus for picking up the scene which is to be transmitted; converting the scene into electrical signals; transmitting these signals to receiving equipment and there optical1y recreating the scene by developing points of light corresponding in intensity and in position to the points of the original scene. The apparatus for accomplishing this, as developed in Bell Telephone Laboratories, was originally demonstrated by transmission over telephone wires from Washington, D. C., to New York, and by radio from an experimental radio station in New Jersey to New York, in April, 1927. The same receiving apparatus and equivalent transmitting apparatus were set up in the auditorium of Bell Telephone Laboratories for demonstration to the Society of Motion Picture Engineers. Transmission took place from one end of the auditorium to the other. The details of both transmitting and receiving apparatus were thus available for inspection by the audience. The operation was described and demonstrated by Dr. Ives, a member of the research department of the Laboratories who has been responsible for the co-ordination of the research and development work which led to the original accomplishment and to its subsequent advances."
"There is really no paper to be presented. Only a Few remarks will be made in connection with the showing of a short length of sound film."
"This paper describes a small sized sound recording adapter designed to fit a standard Mitchell moving picture camera. The need for apparatus which is fairly light and portable has been felt for some time. Devices have already been designed which record sound on the same negative as the picture arid these have proven a valuable supplement to recording apparatus using a separate film. This is especially true in portable work where small space is available and where quick setups have to be made."
"This device is designed to extinguish automatically fire originating in the projector or aperture head and to simultaneously cut off the motor. The latter action of course prevents further film being fed into the head. While extinguishing fire in the aperture head, Pyrene extinguishing liquid is sprayed into the upper and lower magazines in sufficient quantities to create an air dilution or atmosphere incapable of supporting combustion. With upper and lower magazines closed it is then impossible to ignite film contained therein."
"At a meeting of this Association, held at Lake Placid in September, 1927, I had the privilege of presenting a general outline of the plan and scope of an experiment in classroom films which had been undertaken by the Eastman Kodak Company in cooperation with the National Education Association. Today I am to present the results of that experiment."
"The object of this paper as its title suggests is to give you some idea of the organization of the electrical department of a studio and its functions."
"The history of incandescent lighting has been characterized by a succession of advances in the efficiency of light production. Through various steps in development from the early carbon lamps to the gas-filled MAZDA types of today, efficiency increases have come one after another. There have been major improvements in filament materials as when tantalum and tungsten were introduced, and minor changes which produced less spectacular increases. Neglecting the lower cost of electrical energy, and taking all sizes of lamps into consideration, the public receives over ten times as much light for the same power as it did when incandescent lighting was first introduced. The highest wattage lamps regularly used today give seventeen times as much light per watt as did the early carbon lamps. Electrical energy costs much less today than in past decades and lamp prices are but a fraction of what they once were. The effect of all these factors is that on the average, electric lighting costs but one-sixteenth as much as in 1890, and for the largest lamp the cost is only one-nineteenth."
"The first interest displayed by the United States Army in motion pictures was in the field which, at the time, it shared in common with the rest of the world, the field of amusement. During the early history of the motion picture, the Army was concerned solely with the entertainment value of pictures and motion picture shows were to be found in every Army post. Even under canvas in the field, the troops had picture shows. They were welcomed by officers and enlisted men alike. I doubt if there has ever been devised a method of entertainment that more perfectly meets the demand of the military for sane and wholesome recreation than the motion picture. In most commands, a bugle call announced the hour of pictures. In my experience only one other call awakened more general interest, in the command—the one known to all soldiers as “Pay Day”, announcing the presence of the paymaster in camp."
"Off the various types of fixing baths available, the potassium alum acetic-acid-sulfite fixing bath is employed to the greatest extent in modern motion picture film laboratories. Fixing baths containing chrome alum and, to a lesser extent, formaldehyde are also employed, but a description of the properties of such baths will be reserved for a future communication."
"Since the publication of the Kodak fine-grain developer formula for motion picture film1 many requests have been received for further details pertaining to its use, and for methods of altering its photographic characteristics. Experience has shown that the developer cannot be exhausted to the same degree as many developers which have been used previously because it is more sensitive to the retarding action of the products of development. Also a black sludge of metallic silver forms in the developer during its use, and with an exhausted developer an excess of sludge is present which tends to deposit on the negative."
"This study of borax developers was undertaken because their wide use emphasized the importance of detailed knowledge of their action. The results of the study not only permit the selection of a developer formula which seems very satisfactory, but also points out the sort of variations that will either increase or decrease the activity of the developer, to meet any special needs that may occur."
"From inquiries received from sound-picture engineers and sound studios, we know that dry cell batteries are being used to a certain extent in recording and projecting. The details of why and how these batteries are used are not always available, probably, because the art is still experimental and perhaps also because some of the methods are being held secret. At any rate the interest in dry batteries indicates that they are becoming a standard part of the equipment. This being the case, a few words concerning dry cell batteries and their characteristic might be of interest to the motion picture engineers."
"Motion pictures have been used frequently in science and education. Their greatest value for scientific investigations lies in their domination of time. Very rapid movements photographed with the slow motion camera, and very slow movements taken with the time lapse camera are translated into perceptible speeds."
"In the development and growth of a great industry there is often an element or factor whose importance is at first overlooked, or if taken into account at all is considered of small relative value, but which later proves to be one of the real essentials."
"Important events have occurred in the history of the Academy's progress since the last information conveyed to your distinguished Society. These events may be summarized under the following heading: 1. Installation of sound equipment. 2. College Cultural course. 3. Bestowal of Merit Awards. 4. Stanford-Muybridge Memorial."
"In presenting this paper, I wish you all to thoroughly understand that I am not an Astronomer; in fact, I had never given Astronomy much thought until a Charles F. McManus came to me with several pages of data he had secured, dealing very technically with Astronomy, and asked me to read them over and let him know if there were any possible picture material in it. I started to read, but before very long I found myself millions of miles away from this little Earth of ours with very little chance of getting closer as I read further."
"In Photographing dialogue or talking pictures, there are various methods in use, depending mostly on the type of story being filmed. In this article we will discuss only the method that was used in picturizing “Coquette,” on which four cameras were used for most of the sequences. Previous to the actual photographing, two weeks were spent in rehearsals of all the characters having speaking parts, and at the last rehearsal, the camera positions were determined with the co-operation of the director, Sam Taylor."
"The definitions assembled in this revised Report have been taken largely from the latest approved sections of the A. I. E. E. Standards. In some cases several similar definitions are listed, these differing from each other in varying degrees. It was deemed desirable to again call attention to these inconsistencies in this way in order to expedite the work of standardization of the definitions. Many definitions are now included which were not in the August 1927 edition, as they been taken from Sections of the Standards approved since that time. Sections of the Standards approved since that time."
