"The value of any water-power plant is due primarily to its earnings, with earnings dependent on the market for its output, and secondarily to the type and quality of the apparatus installed and of the development as a whole. In the case of plants that are in process of development, or that are only partly loaded, the value is, of course, more or less of a speculative nature, and is estimated on the basis of possible and probable income. Prospective earnings as well as actual earnings necessarily rely on selling an amount of power equal to the maximum or the ultimate capacity of the development; and the number of hours per day during which the maximum capacity can be utilized is a definite factor in deciding the price at which the power is sold. This is equivalent to saying that earnings depend on the load-factor, where that is considered as the ratio between the average output of the station and its rated capacity. Carried to the extreme, zero load-factor means no market for the power and consequently no value to the plant. The type or class of installation, whether good, bad, or indifferent, does not affect such valuation, for the reason that the plant represents nothing as to earning power."
"Hydroelectric power plants are designed with the ultimate object of being producers of wealth. All factors which have any bearing on fixed charges, cost of operation, or sale of power, must be considered. At the time of designing, operating conditions cannot be known definitely and such factors as amount and distribution of load can be considered only in a general way. This is one difference between most water-power and steam stations. When the plant is in operation, conditions of load are constantly undergoing change. It is therefore generally impossible to design a system for fixed conditions, and provision must be made for a certain flexibility of operation and for future growth. Also, costs vary widely in different places and are confidential."
"The effect of the tendency toward high electrical pressures is nowhere more severely felt than in the requirement for insulated wires and cables, for insulation practically controls this feature of electrical distribution. Electrical pressures can, to be sure, be increased to almost any extent, and electrical energy be transmitted to almost any distance; but to control its pathway, to regulate its course, to prevent waste, and maintain safety, this is the problem — the big underlying problem — of all electrical distributions of to-day. Five hundred volts and under are easily controlled; but pressures of 5 000, 10 000, or 20 000 volts introduce new problems, problems that were not even thought of in the days when 110 volts were considered standard practice."
"There are certain practices now so general in underground cable work for light and power in America as to be almost standard. Some of these practices may be examined with advantage."
"Thomas D. Lockwood: In the early years of the telephone exchange, when the telephone engineers of the present time — yes, and the telephone business managers of the present time — were learning their business by hard knocks, we all thought, having no idea of course of what the telephone exchange would grow to, that the greatest and most wonderful feature of telephony was the invention of the telephone itself; and of course in a sense that was so and is so. But when all is said and done, and we have given to the telephone and its inventor all of the credit, honor, and glory to which it and he are unquestionably entitled, I think we should still have enough to spare for the men who have built and perfected the telephone business, who have constructed and perfected the telephone exchange, and who have designed and organized the art of telephone engineering, as expounded in the paper we have just heard."

"In bringing to your notice a new method of turbine control which will presently be explained, it is necessary to discuss, briefly, the theoretical conditions and from them derive a knowledge of the relative importance of the various factors involved. With this knowledge it is easy to deduce the necessity for certain features of design which have, in this method, been provided."
"What percentage of water will it generally require to flow through the by-pass valve in the operation, under one-half open valve, as described?"
"While I have prepared in writing something of an annual address, as required by the Constitution, I shall try to express the substance of my theme to you directly, because I attach some importance to the emphasis that can be given only in this way. All that I would say has been summarized by Francis Bacon in the preface to his “Maxims of the Law” where he says:"
"In the manufacture of induction motors considerations of cost make it advisable to build both two- and three-phase motors on the same size of frame. The questions then arise, given two similar frames without windings, how shall the two-and three-phase windings differ in order to secure proper operation? What will be the comparative losses if both machines are given the same rating, or, if not rated the same, how shall their ratings differ?"
"Every electrical factory occasionally produces an alternator of a size that does not admit of a heat-test under normal conditions of operation, unless there happens to be another alternator of about the same capacity and voltage entering the testing floor at the same time."
"The advent of the inter-pole is due to the demand for motors which operate under conditions so severe that perfect results can not be obtained with those of the standard design. The machine-tool builders quickly saw the advantages of the individual motor drive, largely on account of the possibility of obtaining speed variations, but the 33% increase in speed which the standard constant-speed motor would allow was not sufficient for their requirements. As it seemed evident that the motor builders could furnish motors of special design that would satisfy almost any demand they might make in the way of speed changes, the tool builders have adapted their machines to this form of drive, and call for motors that will operate at from 100% to 500% above minimum speed."
"In this paper will be related the actions of the multigap series resistance type of arrester unit, and the multigap type of arrester unit without the series resistance, experienced during the years 1904 and 1905 on a 33 000-volt transmission system operated by the New Milford Power Company, of New Milford, Connecticut."
"This paper treats of the methods of testing arresters and dielectrics, and presents most of the conditions and precautions the writer has found necessary to observe to obtain useful results. A second paper will include more details of insulation tests, and will describe the application of tests to some new and some old types of arresters."
"There seems to be a diversity of opinion in the operation of transmission systems regarding lightning effects A committee of the National Electric Light Association made a report to the association last year regarding the operation of protective devices. The committee has been continued and will make another report this year. This indicates that electric service is interrupted by lightning, and a desire for improvement in protective devices. The published accounts of protective devices usually contain little regarding actual operating results. Each account is generally a description of the arrester and the principle of operation as regards extinguishing the dynamic arc which follows the lightning discharge. Information that would be of great value to operating engineers is the result secured from arresters in actual service. But little has been published in this regard."
"The dexterity required for successfully connecting in parallel two synchronous machines, and the apprehension that is felt by the operator lest disaster result from the slightest inaccuracy of manipulation, have suggested a study of methods of synchronizing in the hope of diminishing the hazard involved."

"In the death of Theodore Spencer, which occurred at Philadelphia on Sunday, January 28, 1906, after a very brief illness, the telephone interests at large have suffered an irreparable loss."
"Of late the attention of electrical engineers has been frequently called to types of single-phase commutator motors combining the good characteristics of a repulsion motor at starting with the characteristics of a single-phase induction motor near synchronism; the idea being to produce a motor with good starting torque and limited speed, such as would be preeminently suited for tool, elevator, and similar work. In all these cases the combination mentioned has been brought about by a mechanical change, either gradual or sudden, in the armature circuits, this change being effected either by hand or by automatically operating centrifugal devices; in short, by means not inherent to the motor."
"H. A. Lardner: Among the disadvantages of the method of starting synchronous converters from the direct-current side not noted by Mr. Ashe may be included the fact that direct current is not always available. For instance, the converter sub-stations of the majority of interurban railways are shut down at night; and unless storage-batteries are included in their equipment direct current is not available for starting the converters in the morning. Therefore, it becomes necessary to include another method of starting them."

"It is well known that in a circuit containing no iron an impressed sinusoidal electromotive force will cause a sinusoidal current to flow, the current lagging behind the impressed electromotive force by an amount depending upon the relative values of the resistance and inductance, which in this case is constant. Assuming inductance alone in the circuit, the sine current which flows lags 90° behind the sine electromotive force and represents no power, the power-factor (cos 90°) being zero."
"H. F. T. Erben: About fourteen or fifteen years ago I was interested in trying the effect of commutating the poles of a 500-kw. machine. The results were not satisfactory. In looking over the old data, I see now how close we came to attaining success: the pole Was properly proportioned, but we did not provide a sufficiently large magnetizing force for the commutating field. Wethen turned our attention to other matters, and did not renew our experiments on this kind of motor until two or three years ago, when the need of motors for machine-tool work, and generators for direct connection to high-speed steam-turbines, made it necessary to take up again the developing of the commutating-pole machine."
"H. C. Wirt: Line to line discharges have not been admitted by some authorities, and for that reason I present additional data to that presented by me three or four years ago, in a paper before the Institute. In Fig. 21, the four papers represent the arrangement of the arresters; the lower one, the multiplex connection. You will notice the lower one is not punctured. The other punctures were made by voltage effects from line to line. As Mr. Osgood has said, the consensus of opinion expressed here to-day is that the very severe discharges are from line to ground; that wherever the record-pipers show a large hole, the voltage stress was between line and ground. Whether this was part of the actual lightning stroke going into the station and then to ground, we do not know. In order to limit the dynamic effect the gaps might be increased or the character of the metal improved, and therefore a great many tests were made on non-arcing metal."
"C. P. Steinmetz: The day before yesterday we listened to a very interesting dissertation by our worthy President on engineering ethics. I have in the last few days thought over this matter considerably. There is a code of ethics in all other professions. The high standing of the medical profession and of the profession of law is, in my mind, undoubtedly due to their strict code of ethics. Other branches of engineering also have some more or less universally recognized code of ethics. Our profession is the youngest one. There are still amongst us some of the early pioneers, who have seen the beginning of electrical engineering, and they are not so very old yet, either; even in our worthy Secretary we have one — and he is not so old, because as he tells me he is still riding a bicycle — men whose activity began during the times when electrical engineering consisted of telegraphy and nothing else."
"J. B. Taylor: Mr Waters' statement of the tendency to leave off the series field windings of synchronous converters for railway work is either in the nature of a prophecy, or else he has not compared the number of plants operating with compound windings with those operating without them."
"F. F. Schuetz: I must take exception to several of the statements regarding the thermo-electric pyrometer. The author says:"
"E. F. Northrup: It is well known that if aluminum has alloyed with it a small per cent. of copper the electrical conductivity of the aluminum is lowered; the addition of a metal of better conductivity to aluminum thus reducing instead of increasing its conductivity. I would like to ask if Professor Burgess has found an analagous effect in which the permeability of pure nickel is decreased by the addition to it of a small per cent. of pure electrolytic iron, or, on the contrary, does the addition of iron to nickel increase the permeability of the nickel?"
"P. M. Lincoln: What degree of accuracy can be obtained from the accelerometer? The accelerometer, as I understand it, operates from a change of voltage in the transformer, which is caused by a change in current, which in turn is caused by a change in speed. It seems to me that the magnetic lag of the transformer would cause a considerable error in regard to the change in voltage and change in current. Just how much that amounts to, and how an accurate result could be obtained is the question."
"C. P. Steinmetz: I do not quite agree with the author of this paper, or rather, I do not believe that there is such a thing as an art of inventing. I consider inventing as a part of the regular work of the engineer. The engineer has before him a problem to solve, whether it be a problem of design, installation, or operation. He has at his disposition a vast amount of experience, his own and others, and if he is successful he solves the problem in a number of successive steps. Some of these steps are old, and have been taken by others under similar conditions. One, or several, may be new, have never been taken by anybody before; that is, are invention, and as such are covered by patent. These new steps may not necessarily be the most important, the most difficult or ingenious ones, but they are new and as such are invention. But without being put in the position where the problem calls for just such a step, without having at his disposition the vast amount of preceding experience, the engineer would never have made that invention — perhaps he may have invented something else."
"C. P. Steinmetz: As stated in the concluding sentence, this paper is not confined to new matter, it is also somewhat historical in that it reviews in part much of the work that has been done with mercury arc apparatus. As regards the statement of facts contained in the paper, in general I agree with the author; but with his interpretations and explanations of facts I must disagree to a considerable extent, partly for the reason that the paper describes as features of a special class of phenomena features which are characteristic of a far more general class of phenomena; that is, characteristics of arcs in general, the common carbon arc, well known to us for a century, as well as the mercury arc. Furthermore, well-known features are re-explained in connection with the mercury arc by the introduction of new terms; for instance, the so-called cathode or negative resistance, which is nothing more than a reiteration of the fact that an electric arc does not start itself, but must be started. That was known a century ago by Davy, when he drew the first powerful arc by putting battery terminals together and then separating them. But Davy did not introduce the term “negative resistance,” he merely stated the phenomena, which since that time has been used by every designer and operator of arc lamps, though I do not think many of the designers and operators have ever heard anything about negative resistance."
"President Wheeler: The Institute has given a great deal of attention to the interests of the members who are located at a distance from New York. The proposed revised Constitution which was recently put before you, and which was not adopted, principally because a large proportion of the members did not think to send in their ballots, made some additional provisions for local organizations. I hope that in another year or two this Constitution, or something similar to it, will be adopted by the Institute. The summer conventions of the Institute are, as you know, held outside of New York, to bring us into closer contact with the members who live at a distance from that city. Our meeting held in Milwaukee this week is with that object."
