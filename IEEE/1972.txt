"A class of quasi-cyclic multiple-burst-error-correcting codes are constructed in which threshold decoding is used. These codes resemble the interlaced self-orthogonal quasi-cyclic random-error-correcting codes constructed by Townsend and Weldon, but the interlacing depends on the parity-check equations used. These parity-check equations are based on difference triangles that were introduced by Robinson and Bernstein in connection with convolutional codes. A restriction on these codes is that the maximum error burst length allowable is a multiple of a subperiodn_oof the codes. It is shown that in many cases these codes have shorter length than the equivalent interlaced random-error-correcting quasi-cyclic codes."
"Let(X_1,Y_1), \\cdots ,(X_N, Y_N)beNindependent pairs of circularly symmetric random variables, A simple expression is derived for the even moments of the (Euclidean) norm of the vector sum(X_1, Y_1)+\\cdots + (X_N, Y_N)in terms of the moments of(X_i ^2 + Y_i ^2)^{1/2}, i = 1,\\cdots,N. As an application of our results we find an expression for the moments of the \"envelope\" of a sum of randomly phased cosinusoids."
"Given an observation vectory = Ax + \\nu, estimate the parameter vectorxsubject to the known constraint relationshipKx = 0. The covariance matrixRof the measurement error\\nuandAare known block diagonal matrices. The best linear unbiased estimate ofxand its covariance is obtained and compared with a sequential suboptimal estimate."
"It is shown that the mixture of two codes of block lengthncan have a distortion strictly less than the distortion of the best possible code of block lengthnhaving the same rate. The seeming contradiction is explained by offering two interpretations for the mixture of two codes and then explaining why the bound for the performance of the best code cannot be applied directly to the mixture."
"An algorithm is presented for the generation of finite binary sequences having an odd number of terms of value + 1 or -1, whose autocorrelation values are zero for odd shifts."
        "The use of explicit forms for Walsh functions removes much of the confusion surrounding these interesting functions and permits simple proofs of their properties. Thus, for example, their period is far easier to determine than Alexandridis found, but their Fourier spectra are more complex than Schreiber's approximation suggests. For wave-form analysis, certain Walsh functions--the regular symmetric square waves--are more useful than are the others."
"It is shown that any decoding function for a linear binary code can be realized as a weighted majority of nonorthogonal parity checks. An example is given of a four-error-correcting code that is neither L-step orthogonalizable nor one-step majority decodable using non-orthogonal parity checks and yet is one-step weighted-majority decodable using only ten nonorthogonal parity checks."
"Sullivan's recent extension of Gallager's time diversity encoding scheme for combating bursts when there are errors in the guard space is based on the concept of one convolutional code that is contained in another. This paper shows that Sullivan's necessary and sufficient conditions for containment imply a simple factorization of the contained code. Implications for code design, encoders, and decoders for burst- and random-error channels are noted."
"A further modification to Cover and Hart's nearest neighbor decision rule, the reduced nearest neighbor rule, is introduced. Experimental results demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency."
"This paper is primarily tutorial in nature and presents an alternative derivation of the Barankin estimator. The approach presented here places clearly in evidence the significance of the choice of parameter points that one must make in obtaining a Barankin lower bound. Specifically, for any finite set of parameter points, the corresponding Barankin bound is the variance of the locally best estimator that is constrained to be unbiased at the chosen parameter points. In addition, the derivation of the Barankin theory presented here provides a new interpretation of the Cramér-Rao and Bhattacharyya bounds."
 "In a recent note [1] an analysis of certain binary double-error-correcting cyclic codes was made from the point of view of permutation decodability. Specifically, upper bounds on the rates of these codes were established so that the codes would be permutation decodable. The object of the present correspondence is to give corresponding results for binary triple-error-correcting cyclic codes of certain lengths."
  "A number of theorems are given, which give insight into the algebraic structure of group codes for the Gaussian channel, as defined by Slepian. The problem of the existence of group codes for a given pair of defining parameters (i.e., number of codewordsM, and dimension of the signal spacen) is partially solved."
"This paper presents a number of interesting results relating to the determination of actual minimum distance of cyclic codes. Codes with multiple sets of consecutive roots are constructed. A bound on the minimum weight of odd-weight codewords is determined. Relations on the distribution of roots of the generator polynomial are investigated. Location polynomials of reversible codes are examined. These results are used to obtain better estimates of the minimum distance of many new cyclic codes."
"The weight enumerator of a code is the polynomial \\begin{equation} W(x,y)= \\sum_{r=0}^n A_r x^{n-r} y^r, \\end{equation} wherendenotes the block length andA_r, denotes the number of codewords of weightr. LetCbe a self-dual code overGF(q)in which every weight is divisible byc. Then Gleason's theorem states that 1) ifq= 2 andc= 2, the weight enumerator ofCis a sum of products of the polynomialsx^2 + y^2andx^2y^2 (x^2 - y^2 )^2ifq= 2 andc= 4, the weight enumerator is a sum of products ofx^8 + 14x^4 y^4 + y^8andx^4 y^4 (x^4 - y^4)^4; and 3) ifq= 3 andc= 3, the weight enumerator is a sum of products ofx^4 + 8xy^3andy^3(x^3 - y^3)^3. In this paper we give several proofs of Gleason's theorem."
"In this paper, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the designed and actual distances of any sequence of extended primitive BCH codes of increasing lengthsnand fixed rateR. The results of this paper are based on [1, ch. 12], which gives an exact expression for the rates of any sequence of extended primitive BCH codes of increasing length and fixed ratio of distance/length."
"An upper bound on the probability of misrecognition is obtained in terms of Patrick and Fischer's measure of distance and its maximization is shown to minimize the upper bound on the probability of error."
"The hypothesis-testing problem has recently been studied under a finite-memory constraint. However, most work has been concerned with the large-sample theory. Here we study the small-sample theory for binary-valued observations."
"An efficient bidirectional search algorithm for computing the free distance of convolutional codes is described."
"In this correspondence the Mattson-Solomon formulation is applied to cyclic codes with multiple sets of consecutive roots of the generator polynomial and better estimates of the minimum distance of many cyclic codes are obtained."
"A lower boundR_L (D)is obtained to the rate-distortion functionR(D)of a finite-alphabet stationary source with respect to a context-dependent fidelity criterion. For equiprobable memoryless sources and modular distortion measures,R(D) = R_L (D)for allD. It is conjectured that, for a broad class of finite-alphabet sources and context-dependent fidelity criteria, there exists a critical distortionD_c > 0such thatR(D) = R_L (D)forD \\leq D_{c^\\cdot}. The case of a binary source and span-2 distortion measure is treated in detail. Among other results a coding theorem is proved that establishes thatR(0) = \\log (2/r_g), wherer_gis the golden ratio,(1 + \\sqrt{5})/2."
"In this correspondence, a decoding algorithm to decode beyond the BCH bound is introduced. It gives a complete minimum distance decoding for any cyclic code. A comparison between this decoding algorithm and previously existing ones is also given."
"The optimal nonlinear filtering of certain vector-valued diffusion processes embedded in white noise is considered. We derive upper and lower bounds on the minimal causal mean-square error. The derivation of the lower bound is based on information-theoretic considerations, namely the rate-distortion function (\\varepsilon-entropy). The upper bounds are based on linear-filtering arguments. It is demonstrated that for a wide class of high-precision systems, the upper and lower bounds are tight within a factor of 2 or better."
"The effect of ideal bandpass limiting on a signal lying in narrowband Gaussian noise is analyzed. General analytic expressions for the limiter output components are derived using an integral representation for the limiter characteristic. This method allows retention of the phases of all the signals and the intermodulation products at the limiter output, which are destroyed in the characteristic-function method generally used in limiter studies. Expressions for the desired signals and intermodulation product amplitudes are obtained for the case when the limiter input consists of three angle-modulated sinusoids and noise. The analysis is extended tonmodulated sinusoids plus noise, and approximate expressions for the signal, intermodulation product, and noise terms are derived. Numerical results are presented for the signal suppression and the limiter output signal amplitudes for the case of three input signals, two of equal amplitude."
"We first show how reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norms can be determined for a large class of covariance functions by methods based on the solution of a Riccati differential equation or a Wiener-Hopf integral equation. Efficient numerical algorithms for such equations have been extensively studied, especially in the control literature. The innovations representations enter in that it is they that suggest the form of the RKHS norms. From the RKHS norms, we show how recursive solutions can be obtained for certain Fredholm equations of the first kind that are widely used in certain approaches to detection theory. Our approach specifies a unique solution: moreover, the algorithms used are well suited to the treatment of increasing observation intervals."
"An upper bound on the probability of error due to intersymbol interference in a baseband digital communication system for both correlated and uncorrelated digital signals is derived. Examples of the bound are presented for common data communication systems, and in the uncorrelated case, comparison is made with other published results. The bound is computationally simple to apply and in most cases is sufficiently tight to provide a useful design tool."
"A maximum-likelihood sequence estimator for a digital pulse-amplitude-modulated sequence in the presence of finite intersymbol interference and white Gaussian noise is developed, The structure comprises a sampled linear filter, called a whitened matched filter, and a recursive nonlinear processor, called the Viterbi algorithm. The outputs of the whitened matched filter, sampled once for each input symbol, are shown to form a set of sufficient statistics for estimation of the input sequence, a fact that makes obvious some earlier results on optimum linear processors. The Viterbi algorithm is easier to implement than earlier optimum nonlinear processors and its performance can be straightforwardly and accurately estimated. It is shown that performance (by whatever criterion) is effectively as good as could be attained by any receiver structure and in many cases is as good as if intersymbol interference were absent. Finally, a simplified but effectively optimum algorithm suitable for the most popular partial-response schemes is described."
"It is well known that it is often possible to obtain considerable data compression by encoding messages in long blocks. Usually the coding scheme for a specific source depends parametrically on the statistics of the source. Universal codes which are independent of the source statistics are introduced. These codes are shown to be asymptotically optimal in the sense that the probability of encoding error can be made vanishingly small for output rates no larger than those of optimal codes that do in fact depend on the statistics of the source. A particular universal coding scheme is introduced for which the encoding complexity increases no faster than the second power of the block lengthnand for which the encoding error vanishes exponentially withn. The discussion is limited to discrete-time finite-alphabet sources."
"The encoding of sources with unknown statistics is considered. The average distortion that is obtained with universal coding schemes that are independent of the source statistics is shown to be asymptotically identical to the smallest average distortion that can be achieved with the best individual coding scheme (i.e., a code that is based on the specific statistics of the source). This result is shown to hold for any stationary source, as well as for a class of nonstationary sources. The discussion is limited to a certain important class of metric spaces."
"We derive a simple algorithm for the ranking of binary sequences of lengthnand weightw. This algorithm is then used for source encoding a memoryless binary source that generates O's with probabilityqand l's with probabilityp = 1 - q."
"In this paper constructions are given for combining two, three, or four codes to obtain new codes. The Andryanov-Saskovets construction is generalized. It is shown that the Preparata double-error-correcting codes may be extended by about (block length)^{1/2}symbols, of which only one is a check symbol, and thate-error-correcting BCH codes may sometimes be extended by (block !ength)^{1/e}symbols, of which only one is a check symbol. Several new families of linear and nonlinear double-error-correcting codes are obtained. Finally, an infinite family of linear codes is given withd/n = \\frac{1}{3}, the first three being the(24,2^12, 8)Golay code, a(48,2^15, 16)code, and a(96,2^18, 32)code. Most of the codes given have more codewords than any comparable code previously known to us."
    "A new proof has been found to establish the BCH bound, which relates the minimum distance of a cyclic code to the number of consecutive roots its generator polynomial possesses in a certain field. This new proof is recursive in nature and is very simple in structure. It makes no use of the Van der Monde determinant while it unifies the concepts of distance, estimation, and decoding."
"Results useful in the calculation of the exact closed-form expression for the minimum average probability of errorP_eof a binary pulse linear communication system with2Nintersymbol interferences and additive colored Gaussian noise are given. By first performing statistical averaging and then using the variational method, a compact form ofP_ethat depends only on the overall system impulse response taken overNtime instants is obtained. TheseNunknowns are given as the solution ofNsimultaneous nonlinear equations. Specific examples illustrating this approach are considered."
"This correspondence describes the construction of complex codes of the form expi \\alpha_kwhose discrete circular autocorrelations are zero for all nonzero lags. There is no restriction on code lengths."
"A stochastic model is described for the decoder of an optimal burst-correcting convolutional code. From this model, an upper bound is obtained for\\bar{p}, the error probability per word after decoding."
"It is shown that the numberMof binary-valuedn-tuples having fractional weight\\deltaor less,0 < \\delta \\leq \\frac{1}{3}, such that no twon-tuples agree in anyLconsecutive positions, is bounded by2^{2LH(\\delta)+1}. A set ofn-tuples is constructed to show that this bound is not likely to be improved upon by any significant factor. This bound is used to show that the ratiod_{DD}/n_{DD}of definite-decoding minimum distance to definite-decoding constraint length is lower bounded byH^{-l}[\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot (1 - R)/ (1+R)]asn_{DD}grows without bound."
"In a recent paper [1], techniques for reducing the number of majority-logic decoding steps for finite geometry codes have been proposed. However, the lower bound of [1, lemma 4] is incorrect; finite geometry codes, in general, cannot be decoded in less than or equal to three steps of orthogonalization, as was claimed. This correspondence presents a decoding procedure for finite geometry codes that requires as few decoding steps as possible. It is shown that the minimum number of steps is a logarithmic function of the dimension of the associated geometry."
  "This paper is concerned with the differences between deterministic and randomized finite-memory decision rules. It is shown that for any hypothesis-testing problem there exists ab < \\inftysuch that, for anyB, the optimal deterministic rule withB + bbits in memory has a lower error probability than the optimal randomized rule withBbits in memory. Suboptimal deterministic rules with this property are demonstrated. These deterministic rules lose at mostbbits. Thus for large memories the fraction of memory, measured in bits, lost by deterministic rules is negligible."
"We define continuous incrementally stationary channels with finite incremental input- and output-memories and prove the coding theorem and its converse for such channels. These channels include, as special cases, stationary channels with finite input- and output-memories and incrementally stationary and memoryless channels. The former is defined here and the latter has been defined previously. It is emphasized that, with an elementary measure-theoretic formulation, the standard method of proving the coding theorem for discrete channels becomes directly applicable for continuous channels. Consequently, the tedious step of representing a continuous channel by an infinite series of discrete channels can be avoided entirely."
"This correspondence generalizes some recent results on relations between minimum-variance estimates of random signals in Gaussian noise and likelihood ratios."
"Finite mixtures of Laguerre distribution are identifiable."
"Utilizing the theory of invariant imbedding, a Cauchy system suitable for real-time calculation is presented for the solution of the basic Fredholm integral equation of linear least squares filtering theory when the signal process is stationary. Extensions are also mentioned for more general nonstationary processes."
"This correspondence is concerned with a stochastic approximation algorithm having a nonstationary regression function. Convergence conditions and a mean-square error bound are presented. Its possible application to feedback communication is discussed briefly."
"Series representations, as well as exact expressions, are obtained for correlation functions and power density spectra of quantized Gaussian signals transmitted over discrete memoryless channels. The mean-square reconstruction error that results from linear filtering the received samples is expressed in terms of these power density spectra and is then examined."
"LetX_1,X_2,\\cdotsbe a sequence of independent identically distributed observations with a common mean\\mu. Assume that0 \\leq X_i \\leq 1with probability 1. We show that for each\\varepsilon > 0there exists an integerm, a finite-valued statisticT_n = T_n(X_1, \\cdots , X_n) \\in \\{t_1,\\cdots,t_m\\}and a real-valued functionddefined on\\{t_1,\\cdots,t_m\\}such thati)T_{n+1} = f_n(T_n,X_{n+1}); ii)P[\\lim \\sup \\mid d(T_n) - \\mu \\mid \\leq \\varepsilon] = 1. Thus we have a recursive-like estimate of\\mu, for which the data are summarized for eachnby one ofmstates and which converges to within\\varepsilonof\\muwith probability 1. The constraint on memory here is time varying as contrasted to the time-invariant constraint that would haveT_{n+1} = f(T_n, X_{n+1})for alln."
"Several expressions are derived for the probability of error of a binary coherent phase-shift keyed communication system in the presence of interference due to discrete multipath propagation."
"By defining mutual information as a maximum over an appropriate space, channel capacities can be defined as double maxima and rate-distortion functions as double minima. This approach yields valuable new insights regarding the computation of channel capacities and rate-distortion functions. In particular, it suggests a simple algorithm for computing channel capacity that consists of a mapping from the set of channel input probability vectors into itself such that the sequence of probability vectors generated by successive applications of the mapping converges to the vector that achieves the capacity of the given channel. Analogous algorithms then are provided for computing rate-distortion functions and constrained channel capacities. The algorithms apply both to discrete and to continuous alphabet channels or sources. In addition, a formalization of the theory of channel capacity in the presence of constraints is included. Among the examples is the calculation of close upper and lower bounds to the rate-distortion function of a binary symmetric Markov source."
"In analogy to the orthogonal functionals of the Brownian-motion process developed by Wiener, ltô, and others, a theory of the orthogonal functionals of the Poisson process is presented making use of the concept of multivariate orthogonal polynomials. Following a brief discussion of Charlier polynomials of a single variable, multivariate Charlier polynomials are introduced. An explicit representation as well as an orthogonality property are given. A multiple stochastic integral of a multivariate function with respect to the Poisson process, called the multiple Poisson-Wiener integral, is defined using the multivariate Charlier polynomials. A multiple Poisson-Wiener integral, which gives a polynomial functional of the Poisson process, is orthogonal to any other of different degree. Several explicit forms are given for the sake of application. It is shown that any nonlinear functional of the Poisson process with finite variance can be developed in terms of these orthogonal functionals, corresponding to the Cameron-Martin theorem in the case of the Brownian-motion process. Finally, some possible applications to nonlinear problems associated with the Poisson process are briefly discussed."
"This paper deals with the problem of selecting optimum probing signals for identifying multiple-input multiple-output time-varying linearM-ary channels in the presence of colored Gaussian noise. Unequal emission and observation intervals are considered and necessary and sufficient conditions for nonsingular identification are established. Hilbert-space methods are used for unifying many seemingly different problems in a single framework."
"Nonlinear stochastic estimation theory is applied to the problem of obtaining discrete-time demodulator structures for the common types of analog communication signals. A stochastic communication model is presented that can be treated with current results in estimation theory. Approximate algorithms are developed for the estimation problem that yield mathematically realizable receiver structures for the cases of AM, PM, and FM. The digital receivers yield performance characteristics that compare favorably with those of their analog counterparts."
"The detection problem arises due to the false-alarm vulnerability of remote unmanned, signal detectors, typical in current wildlife-tracking studies. Some rather old theory is modified to overcome the effects of transient noise sources such as automobile engines or lightning. The resulting equipment is a simple up-down counter, tending to advance in the presence of large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and down-count otherwise. Probability of error for various situations is derived, wherein it is shown that false-alarm probability will be upper bounded and then decrease as noise increases above its quiescent level. The cost of the noise protection in terms of probabilities of error versus SNR is indicated by an example."
"A set of equally long finite sequences, the elements of which are either + 1 or - 1, is said to be a complementary set of sequences if the sum of autocorrelation functions of the sequences in that set is zero except for a zero-shift term. A complementary set of sequences is said to be a mate of another set if the sum of the cross-correlation functions of the corresponding sequences in these two sets is zero everywhere. Complementary sets of sequences are said to be mutually orthogonal complementary sets if any two of them are mates to each other. In this paper we discuss the properties of such complementary sets of sequences. Algorithms for synthesizing new sets from a given set are given. Recursive formulas for constructing mutually orthogonal complementary sets are presented. It is shown that matrices consisting of mutually orthogonal complementary sets of sequences can be used as operators so as to per form transformations and inverse transformations on a one- or two-dimensional array of real time or spatial functions. The similarity between such new transformations and the Hadamard transformation suggests applications of such new transformations to signal processing and image coding."
"A method is presented that decreases the number of instructions needed to decode a pseudorandom phase-coded radar signal. The efficiency of this method increases exponentially as a function of the code length."
"A method of shortening finite analytic geometry codes, projective-geometry (PG) codes, Euclidean-geometry (EG) codes, and 2-fold EG codes is presented. The shortened codes preserve the feature of being majority-logic decodable and they have the same error-correcting capability as the original codes. Combinatorial expressions for the parity-check symbols of the shortened codes are derived."
"In many practical pattern-classification problems the underlying probability distributions are not completely known. Consequently, the classification logic must be determined on the basis of vector samples gathered for each class. Although it is common knowledge that the error rate on the design set is a biased estimate of the true error rate of the classifier, the amount of bias as a function of sample size per class and feature size has been an open question. In this paper, the design-set error rate for a two-class problem with multivariate normal distributions is derived as a function of the sample size per class(N)and dimensionality(L). The design-set error rate is compared to both the corresponding Bayes error rate and the test-set error rate. It is demonstrated that the design-set error rate is an extremely biased estimate of either the Bayes or test-set error rate if the ratio of samples per class to dimensions(N/L)is less than three. Also the variance of the design-set error rate is approximated by a function that is bounded by1/8N."
     "This correspondence presents a new class of cyclic majority-logic decodable codes. The codes provide unequal error protection for the information digits, i.e., some decoded digits are guaranteed to be correct despitet_1or fewer channel errors even though the minimum distance of the code guarantees protection from onlyt_0errors andt_1 > t_0."
"In this correspondence some classes of unequal protection codes are constructed utilizing difference sets or triangles. These codes use threshold decoding."
"The burst-bdistance between two binary vectors is defined and shown to be a metric. This definition is applied to a binary-input,Q-ary output channel where errors occur in bursts. A decoding algorithm is presented for such a channel that is an extension of Weldon's [2] weighted erasure decoding. Examples are presented illustrating the techniques."
"At each step in Berlekamp's iterative algorithm for BCH codes, the decoder follows one of two possible branches. This correspondence presents a slight rephrasing of the algorithm for binary codes, which results in a very simple circuit for controlling the branching process. This circuit also performs all necessary tests on the validity of the resulting error-locator polynomial."
 "The analysis of an arbitrary number of signals plus noise passed through a nonlinearity is extended to the general class of\\nuth-law devices. Closed-form approximations to a number of special cases of interest are obtained from the general result. Using the approximations a method for suppressing undesired intermodulation terms is suggested; it is confirmed by laboratory measurements."
"Recently Mazo and Salz proved that if\\{ Y(t), t \\in T \\}is a stationary random process with mean-square derivative\\{ \\dot{Y}(t), t \\in T \\}, then the conditional expectation of\\dot{Y} (t)givenY(t)is zero almost everywhere with respect to the distribution ofY(t). We extend this property and obtain a characterization of stationary processes differentiable in mean square."
"Without special assumptions as to the values of coefficients, the simplifications due to central symmetry in worst case estimation, for linear systems with convex constraints, can be obtained only in the case of (generalized) energy constraints."
"Forx(t)either a deterministic or stochastic signal band-limited to the normalized frequency interval\\mid\\omega\\mid \\leq \\pi, explicit coefficients\\{ a_{kn} \\}are exhibited that have the property that \\begin{equation} lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\parallel x(t) - \\sum_{1}^n a_{kn} x(t - kT) \\parallel = 0 \\end{equation} in an appropriate norm and for any constant intersample spacingTsatisfying0 < T < \\fac{1}{2}; that is,x(t)may be approximated arbitrarily well by a linear combination of past samples taken at any constant rate that exceeds twice the associated Nyquist rate. Moreover, the approximation ofx(t)is uniform in the sense that the coefficients\\{ a_{kn} \\}do not depend on the detailed structure ofx(t)but are absolute constants for any choice ofT. The coefficients that are obtained provide a sharpening of a previous result by Wainstein and Zubakov where a rate in excess of three times the Nyquist rate was required."
"The problem of reconstructing a finite-duration finite-energy signal that has been band limited and sampled is considered. An interpolation formula is derived that, in principle, permits perfect signal reconstruction in the noiseless case provided only that the sampling frequency exceeds the cutoff frequency of the band-limiting filter. The degradation introduced by measurement noise on the samples is evaluated."
"Two adaptations of the nonparametric Wilcoxon test for use in detecting a coherent train of narrow-band signal pulses with unknown starting phase in a background of statistically undefined noise have been proposed in the literature. The performance of these detectors when the noise is stationary Gaussian is determined and compared. For a finite train of signal pulses, results were obtained by Monte Carlo simulation using the variance-reducing technique of importance sampling. For the best of the two narrow-band Wilcoxon detectors a comparison with the optimum parametric detector shows that for a train of 30 signal pulses and a false-alarm probability ofP_f = 10^{-6}the loss is about 2 dB, while for 50 signal pulses the loss is reduced to 1 dB. The theoretical asymptotic loss is 0.2 dB."
"The well-known error formula for Lagrange interpolation is used to derive an expression for a truncation error bound in terms of the sampling rate and Nyquist frequency for regular samples and central interpolation. The proof is restricted to pulse-type functions possessing a Fourier transform. The formula finds application to the estimation of convergence rate in iterative interpolation, thus providing a criterion for the choice of sampling rate to achieve a specified truncation error level in a given number of steps. The formula can also be used as a guide when the samples are not regular but fairly evenly distributed."
"A decision-directed scheme for estimating the mean is expressed as a stochastic approximation algorithm. The algorithm is shown to converge, but not to the true value, by means of the theory of stochastic approximation. A modification of the algorithm that converges to the true value is presented."
"A nonparametric sequential pattern classifier called a linear sequential classifier (LSC) is presented. The pattern components are measured sequentially and the decisions either to measure the next component or to stop and classify the pattern are made using linear functions derived from sample patterns based on the least mean-square error criterion. The required linear functions are computed using an adaption of Greville's recursive algorithm for computing the generalized inverse of a matrix. A recursive algorithm for computing the least mean-square error is given and is used to determine the order in which the pattern components are measured. Under the assumption of two equiprobable classes that are normally distributed with equal covariance matrices, it is shown that the LSC is equivalent to Wald's sequential probability ratio test. Computer-simulated experiments indicate that the LSC is more effective than existing nonparametric sequential classifiers."
"This correspondence derives an upper bound on the probability of error of them-class Bayes decision process when the patterns observed have first-order stochastic dependence. The bound is derived by applying an information-theoretic approach in which both the equivocation and the Bhattacharyya coefficient play a role."
"In this correspondence we analyze the error-propagation problem that is encountered in decoding noncatastrophic codes with feedback decoders. We show that if thc decoding depth is too short, unlimited error propagation will occur and that the depth can be chosen long enough so that unlimited error propagation does not occur when minimum-distance feedback decoders are used."
"The filtering problem of a system with linear dynamics and non-Gaussian a priori distribution is investigated. A closed-form exact solution to the problem is presented along with an approximation scheme. The approximation is made in the construction of a mathematical model. It reduces optimal estimation to a combination of linear estimations. The asymptotic behavior of the filter is examined. The limiting distributions of the conditional mean and the conditional-error covariance exist as the time interval of observation becomes infinite. In the autonomous case, the estimate for the Wiener problem satisfies a linear stochastic differential equation. A large class of nonlinear problems with more nonlinear features than the one discussed above can be reduced to it through the idea of finite-dimensional sensor orbits. The general idea and a number of examples are discussed briefly."
"We are interested in estimating the moments of the spectral density of a comp[ex Gaussian signal process\\{ q^{(1)} (t) \\}when the signal process is immersed in independent additive complex Gaussian noise\\{q^{(2)} (t) \\}. Using vector samplesQ = \\{ q(t_1),\\cdots ,q(t_m)\\}, whereq(t) = q^{(1)}(t) + q^{(2)}(t), estimators for determining the spectral moments or parameters of the signal-process power spectrum may be constructed. These estimators depend upon estimates of the covariance functionR_1 (h)of the signal process at only one value ofh \\neq 0. In particular, ifm = 2, these estimators are maximum-likelihood solutions. (The explicit solution of the likelihood equations form > 2is still an unsolved problem.) using these solutions, asymptotic (with sample size) formulas for the means and variances of the spectral mean frequency and spectral width are derived. It is shown that the leading term in the variance computations is identical with the Cramér-Rao lower bound calculated using the Fisher information matrix. Also considered is the case Where the data set consists ofNsamples Of continuous data, each of finite duration. In this case asymptotic (withN) formulas are also derived for the means and variances of the spectral mean frequency and spectral width."
"Simultaneous detection and estimation under multiple hypotheses when data from only one observation interval are available, are treated on the basis of statistical decision theory. Estimation is carried out under the assumption that the signal of interest is not present with probability 1, which is necessary if detection is to be a meaningful operation. Also, we consider the case where the operations of detection and estimation are coupled. Specific detector and estimator structures are determined for the case of strong coupling when the cost of estimation error is given by a quadratic function. The detector structures are in general complex nonlinear functions of the received data. However, a detailed analysis of the Gaussian case resulted in a type of correlation detector, which correlates the received data with the least square estimators of the possible signals in the absence of uncertainty. The associated optimum estimator structure is found to be a weighted sum of least square estimators in the absence of uncertainty. Also, joint detection and estimation under multiple hypotheses is discussed for the case of a simple cost function. The estimators that result can be interpreted as generalized maximum-likelihood estimators. Finally, optimum prediction and filtering are briefly considered."
"Thek_nnearest neighbor classification rule is a nonparametric classification procedure that assigns a random vectorZto one of two populations\\pi_1, \\pi_2. Samples of equal sizenare taken from\\pi_1and\\pi_2and are ordered separately with respect to their distance fromZ = z. The rule assignsZto\\pi_1if the distance of thek_nth sample observation from\\pi_1tozis less than the distance of thek_nth sample observation from\\pi_2toz; otherwiseZis assigned to\\pi_2. This rule is equivalent to the Fix and Hodges, \"majority rule\" [4] or the nearest neighbor rule of Cover and Hart [3]. This paper studies some asymptotic properties of this rule including an expression for a consistent upper bound on the probability of misclassification."
"When a given statistical decision problem occurs repeatedly, there is interest in the strategy that plays Bayes versus the empirical distribution of past parameter values. We point out some implications that some previously investigated continuity conditions have on the stability of average loss, risk, and average risk across the sequence of decision problems. This is done first for arbitrary parameter sequences and then in the context of independent and identically distributed parameters."
"An iterative estimation procedure involving the use of a light limiter is proposed for obtaining robust estimates of the amplitude of a signal of known form in additive nearly Gaussian noise. In the case of a constant signal the procedure, referred to as the iterative limiter estimator (ILE), is exhibited as a form of stochastic approximation and the procedure is shown to be robust in a well-defined asymptotically min-max sense. The ILE is also shown to be asymptotically robust in terms of efficiency relative to the sample mean. in the case of a time-varying signal the procedure is referred to as an iterative limiter-correlator estimator (ILCE). Simulation results show that both the ILE and the ILCE possess a high degree of robustness for seemingly mild, but potent, deviations from the Gaussian model. This robustness is obtained at the expense of a relatively small loss in efficiency when the noise is actually Gaussian."
"This paper deals with the classification of signals in terms of their autocorrelation functions. For each of two classes the eigenfunctions of the autocorrelation function are found, and a proper subset of each one is chosen. An unknown signal is classified by comparing the norms of its projections on the two subsets of eigenfunctions. By working with the eigenfunctions corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues, the method approximates singular detection. An application of this technique is shown for the classification of engine-vibration records as a basis for automatic mechanical fault diagnosis."
"This paper considers the effects of channel errors on the digital transmission of color images. In the transmission system analyzed, each picture element of a color image is represented by three color components. Two cases are considered: the tristimulus representation and the luminance and chromaticity representation. Each color component is coded with a constant-word-length PCM code and passed through a binary symmetric channel. Channel errors are related to chromaticity and luminance errors in a reconstructed image by the use of color space diagrams. Statistical characteristics of image errors are determined for various color representations. It has been found that if the tristimulus values of a color are transmitted over the channel, the effects of channel errors are to desaturate ali colors toward a mid-gray. For luminance/chromaticity representations, channel errors tend to shift the hue of transmitted colors toward cyan, magenta, or yellow."
"For any rateR, 0 < R < 1, a sequence of specific(n,k)binary codes with rateR_n > Rand minimum distancedis constructed such that \\begin{equation} \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\inf \\frac{d}{n} \\geq (1 - r ^{-1} R)H^{-1} (1 - r)> 0 \\end{equation} (and hence the codes are asymptotically good), whereris the maximum of\\frac{1}{2}and the solution of \\begin{equation} R = \\frac{r^2}{1 + \\log_2 [1 - H^{-1}(1 - r)]}. \\end{equation} The codes are extensions of the Reed-Solomon codes overGF(2^m)With a simple algebraic description of the added digits. Alternatively, the codes are the concatenation of a Reed-Solomon outer code of lengthN = 2^m - 1withNdistinct inner codes, namely all the codes in Wozeneraft's ensemble of randomly shifted codes. A decoding procedure is given that corrects all errors guaranteed correctable by the asymptotic lower bound ond. This procedure can be carried out by a simple decoder which performs approximatelyn^2 \\log ncomputations."
"Some general equations are derived for the smoothing density of a Markov process that modulates the intensity of an observed doubly stochastic Poisson process. The equations are in terms of filtering densities that are specified by recursive equations."
"In this paper we consider the problem of estimation and detection of Weak optical signals formulated as a problem in point process theory. Indeed at very low light intensity the only information available from an intensity detector is the random distribution of time instants\\{t_i \\}at which photons of the field are absorbed and photoelectrons emitted. There is also a noise due to thermoelectrons or to a background optical field. Starting from the statistical properties of the point process\\{t_i\\}, we formulate for various kinds of optical fields the problem of estimation of the light intensity of a modulated beam. We show that in some cases the number of photoelectrons is a sufficient statistic. In general, theoretical results are complex and we formulate the problem in the case of linear estimation, which is solved by means of the resolvent of an integral equation using the covariance function of the field. Some detection problems are also considered."
"Error expressions for optimal linear causal filtering of second-order stationary processes are derived by a method based on Hardy space theory. This method is applicable when one of the spectral densities is rational with a known structure. The operations involved in the computation of error expressions are mainly simple residue evaluations. Several examples are given."
"A class of point processes that possess intensity functions are studied. The processes of this class, which seem to include most point processes of practical interest, are called regular point processes (RPP's). Expressions for the evolution of these processes and especially for their joint occurrence statistics are derived. Compound RPP's, which are RPP's whose intensity functions are themselves stochastic processes, are shown to be RPP's whose intensity functions are given as the causal minimum mean-squared-error (MMSE) estimates of the given intensity functions. The superposition of two independent RPP's is shown to yield an RPP whose intensity is given as a causal least squares estimate of the appropriate combination of the two given intensity functions. A general likelihood-ratio formula for the detection of compound RPP's is obtained. Singular detection cases are characterized. Detection procedures thai use only the total number of counts are discussed. As an example, the optimal detection scheme for signals of the random-telegraph type with unknown transition intensities is derived."
"Gleason has recently shown that the weight enumerators of binary and ternary self-dual codes are polynomials in two given polynomials. In this paper it is shown that classical invariant theory permits a straightforward and systematic proof of Gleason's theorems and their generalizations. The joint weight enumerator of two codes (analogous to the joint density function of two random variables) is defined and shown to satisfy a MacWilliams theorem. Invariant theory is then applied to generalize Gleason's theorem to the complete weight enumerator of self-dual codes overGF(3), the Lee metric enumerator overGF(5)(given by Klein in 1884!) and overGF(7)(given by Maschke in 1893!), the Hamming enumerator overGF(q), and overGF(4)with all weights divisible by 2, the joint enumerator of two self-dual codes overGF(2), and a number of other results."
"Variable-length-to-block codes are a generalization of run-length codes. A coding theorem is first proved. When the codes are used to transmit information from fixed-rate sources through fixed-rate noiseless channels, buffer overflow results. The latter phenomenon is an important consideration in the retrieval of compressed data from storage. The probability of buffer overflow decreases exponentially with buffer length and we determine the relation between rate and exponent size for memoryless sources. We obtain codes that maximize the overflow exponent for any given transmission rate exceeding the source entropy and present asymptotically optimal coding algorithms whose complexity grows linearly with codeword length. It turns out that the optimum error exponents of variable-length-to-block coding are identical with those of block-to-variable-length coding and are related in an interesting way to Renyi's generalized entropy function."
"Polynomial codes and their dual codes as introduced by Kasami, Lin, and Peterson have considerable algebraic and geometric structure. It has been shown that these codes contain many well-known classes of cyclic codes as subclasses, such as BCH codes, projective geometry codes (PG codes), Euclidean geometry codes (EG codes), and generalized Reed-Muller codes (GRM codes). In this paper, combinatorial expressions for the number of information symbols and parity-check symbols in polynomial codes are derived. The results are applied to two important subclasses of codes, the PG codes and EG codes."
 "A new class of block codes with specified length and maximum Hamming distance between the codewords is given. It is also shown that the proposed codes have the largest number of words when the maximum Hamming distance specified is 1, 2, or 3."
"For1 \\leq i \\leq m - s- 2and0 \\leq s \\leq m -2i, the intersection of the binary BCH code of designed distance2 ^{m-s-1} - 2 ^{m-s-t-1} - 1and length2^m - 1with the shortened(s + 2)th-order Reed-Muller code of length2^m -- 1has codewords of weight2^{m-s-1} - 2^{m-s-t-1} - 1."
"A binary code of length 12 and minimum distance 5 with 32 words was discovered by Nadler in 1961. Systematic descriptions of this code given later use larger codes. This correspondence gives a direct construction of Nadler's code."
 "Amplitude quantization and permutation encoding are two of the many approaches to efficient digitization of analog data. It is shown in this paper that these seemingly different approaches actually are equivalent in the sense that their optimum rate versus distortion performances are identical. Although this equivalence becomes exact only when the quantizer output is perfectly entropy coded and the permutation code block length is infinite, it nonetheless has practical consequences both for quantization and for permutation encoding. In particular, this equivalence permits us to deduce that permutation codes provide a readily implementable block-coding alternative to buffer-instrumented variable-length codes. Moreover, the abundance of methods in the literature for optimizing quantizers with respect to various criteria can be translated directly into algorithms for generating source permutation codes that are optimum for the same purposes. The optimum performance attainable with quantizers (hence, permutation codes) of a fixed entropy rate is explored too. The investigation reveals that quantizers with uniformly spaced thresholds are quasi-optimum with considerable generality, and are truly optimum in the mean-squared sense for data having either an exponential or a Laplacian distribution. An attempt is made to provide some analytical insight into why simple uniform quantization is so good so generally."
       "In this paper, two-dimensional arrays of elements of an arbitrary finite field are examined, especially arrays having maximum-area matrices. We first define two-dimensional linear recurring arrays. In order to study the characteristics of two-dimensional linear recurring arrays, we also define two-dimensional linear cyclic codes. A systematic method of constructing two-dimensional linear recurring arrays having maximum-area matrices is given using the theory of two-dimensional cyclic codes. These arrays, here called\\gamma \\beta-arrays, may be said to be two-dimensional analogs ofM-sequences. A\\gamma \\beta-array of areaN_x \\times N_yexists overGF(q)if and only ifN_x N_yis equal toq^N _ 1for some positive integerN. Many interesting characteristics of the\\gamma \\beta-array, such as the properties of its autocorrelation function and the properties of the characteristic arrays, are deduced and explained."
"In the fields of communication and control there sometimes arises the problem of determining the characteristics of a time-invariant system from discrete records of its input and output during a limited interval of time, where the output data are contaminated with random noise. When this system is linear, we can use the convolution sum to obtain a characterization of the output as a linear combination of past inputs. Hill and McMurtry [4] showed that if we choose a Legendre binary noise sequence as input to a linear system, then the least squares approximation to the characterizing coefficients is expressible in a computationally feasible form, even when a large number of coefficients is involved. In this correspondence we characterize a nonlinear system by a generalization of the convolution sum and show that if we choose Golomb's maximal linear recurring binary-noise sequence [2] as input, then the least squares approximation to the characterizing coefficients is expressible in a computationally feasible form. Thus, the maximal linear recurring sequence occupies the same role in investigating certain nonlinear systems that the Legendre sequence occupies in investigating linear systems."
"An experimental study is reported of the correlation properties of the intervals between zero crossings of a Gaussian process. The validity of an assumption under which McFadden derived certain theoretical results is examined. It is found that the assumption is valid only for processes with narrow-band spectra. For broad-band spectra, the correlation coefficients of the intervals decay slowly and oscillate with increasing separation between intervals."
"The well-known sampling theorem for wide-sense stationary random processes is generalized to the class of nonstationary random processes."
"A confidence model for finite-memory learning systems is advanced in this correspondence. The primary difference between this and the previously used probability-of-error model is that a measure of confidence is associated with each decision and any incorrect decisions are weighted according to their confidence measure in figuring total loss. The optimal rule for this model is deterministic, whereas the previous model required randomized rules to achieve minimum error probability."
"In an optimum pattern-recognition system the error rate is determined by the reject function. This correspondence describes how this property may be exploited to provide quantitative tests of model validity using unclassified test samples. These tests are basically goodness-of-fit tests for a function of the observations. One of these tests is shown to provide an improved estimate of error in Monte Carlo studies of complex systems. Results are given for normal distributions when parameters are estimated. In this case error estimates obtained from the empirical reject rate underestimate the actual error and performance depends on the ratio of design samples to dimension."
"A published expression for the mean-square error arising in PCM transmission is shown to be exact for uniform but not for all symmetrical distributions."
"A class of high-speed decodable burst-correcting codes is presented. This class of codes is obtained by modifying burst-correcting convolutional codes into block codes and does not require any cyclic shifts in the decoding process. With the appropriate choices of parameters, the codes can approximate minimum-redundancy codes. The high-speed decodability is expected to make these codes suitable for application to computer systems."
"Two error-erasure decoding algorithms for product codes that correct all the error-erasure patterns guaranteed correctable by the minimum Hamming distance of the product code are given. The first algorithm works when at least one of the component codes is majority-logic decodable. The second algorithm works for any product code. Both algorithms use the decoders of the component codes."
"The purpose of this survey is to describe the results of research in information theory in the USSR, from the beginning of such research through the recent past."
"Since covariance matrices of weakly stationary random processes are Toeplitz, much of the theory involving asymptotic results for such processes is simply the theory of the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz forms. The fundamental theorem of this type is the Szegö theorem on the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of Toeplitz matrices. This theorem is often quoted but relatively little understood in the engineering literature. In this tutorial paper we prove the Szegiö theorem for the special case of finite-order Toeplitz matrices. In this setting the mathematical sophistication of the classical proofs is not required and the proof is both simple and intuitive--yet it contains the important concepts involved in the most general case."
"The concept of a white Gaussian noise (WGN) innovations process has been used in a number of detection and estimation problems. However, there is fundamentally no special reason why WGN should be preferred over any other process, say, for example, an nth-order stationary autoregressive process. In this paper, we show that by working with the proper metric, any Gaussian process can be used as the innovations process. The proper metric is that of the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This is not unexpected, but what is unexpected is that in this metric some basic concepts, like that of a causal operator and the distinction between a causal and a Volterra operator, have to be carefully reexamined and defined more precisely and more generally. It is shown that if the problem of deciding between two Gaussian processes is nonsingular, then there exists a causal (properly defined) and causally invertible transformation between them. Thus either process can be regarded as a generalized innovations process. As an application, it is shown that the likelihood ratio (LR) for two arbitrary Gaussian processes can, when it exists, be written in the same form as the LR for a known signal in colored Gaussian noise. This generalizes a similar result obtained earlier for white noise. The methods of Gohberg and Krein, as specialized to reproducing kernel spaces, are heavily used."
"A technique for decomposing a composite signal of unknown multiple wavelets overlapping in time is described. The computation algorithm incorporates the power cepstrum and complex cepstrum techniques. It has been found that the power cepstrum is most efficient in recognizing wavelet arrival times and amplitudes while the complex cepstrum is invaluable in estimating the form of the basic wavelet and its echoes, even if the latter are distorted. Digital data-processing problems such as the detection of multiple echoes, various methods of linear filtering the complex cepstrum, the picket-fence phenomenon, minimum-maximum phase situations, and amplitude- versus phase-smoothing for the additive-noise case are examined empirically and where possible theoretically, and are discussed. A similar investigation is performed for some of the preceding problems when the echo or echoes are distorted versions of the wavelet, thereby giving some insight into the complex problem of separating a composite signal composed of several additive stochastic processes. The threshold results are still empirical and the results should be extended to multi-dimensional data. Applications are the decomposition or resolution of signals (e.g., echoes) in radar and sonar, seismology, speech, brain waves, and neuroelectric spike data. Examples of results are presented for decomposition in the absence and presence of noise for specified signals. Results are tendered for the decomposition of pulse-type data appropriate to many systems and for the decomposition of brain waves evoked by visual stimulation."

"Co-Fe-Cu-Ce permanent-magnet alloys have been prepared by directional solidification using a modified Bridgman technique. Samples melted at low superheat temperatures (\\DeltaT \\sim 20\\degC above the melting point of about 1100°C) and solidified at moderate rates (∼2.3 cm/h) resulted in a reasonably homogeneous columnar grain structure with a preferred crystallographic orientation. Thecaxis is generally aligned within 15° of the growth axis. Increasing the speed of solidification led to a fine-grained structure with no texture, while decreasing the speed led to coarse columnar grains with erratic orientation. A large superheat temperature (\\DeltaT \\sim 300-400\\degC resulted in a reaction of the liquid with the alumina crucible wall and led to the formation of face-centered cubic Co-rich dendrites. With the modified Bridgman technique, oriented samples 8 cm long and 2.54 cm in diameter have been prepared with good magnetic properties. After annealing at 1000°C followed by aging at 400°C, a Co3.5Fe0.5CuCe alloy exhibited values ofiHc= 7000 Oe, Br= 6100 G, and(BH)_{\\max} = 9.2MG.Oe. A Co3.6Fe0.5Cu0.9Ce alloy exhibited values ofiHc= 6000 Oe,B_{r} = 6250G, aud(BH)_{\\max} = 9.5MG.Oe after similar treatment."
"The tangential force in overlapped-pole and attracted-slab geometries typical of electromechanical devices is examined for the case of magnetic or dielectric material having an ideally square saturation characteristic. Simple force expressions for large overlap are presented, these indicating in general a doubling of force as compared with the linear case, and a linear rather than square-law variation of force with driving potential difference (magnetic or electric). The approach for the overlapped-pole geometry, based on the physically nonrealizable idealization of ideally squareB-Hmaterial characteristic, yields results correlating remarkably well with experimental measurements."
"The transient magnetic field of a strip line in a memory device with a finite conductivity ground plane and a finite permeability magnetic keeper is studied. The driving source consists of a line current or a uniform current sheet. The waveform of the current is assumed to be piecewise linear. Laplace and Fourier transform methods are used to obtain the field."
"A clear-view display and printing device is proposed utilizing a new bubble-domain shift register which has triangular patterns etched into the surface of a magnetic crystal. The geometrical and materials requirements for the clear-view shift register are analyzed. The etched-out triangular pattern is shown to provide the unidirectionality of bubble motion under an oscillating bias field just as the triangular Permalloy overlay does. An etched depth of one-tenth of the plate thickness and an etched gradient of about unity are shown to be sufficient for the expected shift-register operation."
"The electrochemical properties of the Alnico alloys are shown to be sensitive to their state of precipitation. These properties thus are used as an indirect means for evaluating the individual properties of the ferromagnetic phases in these alloys. Results are then compared with recent findings and are shown to agree reasonably well, particularly in the case of Alnico 5."
"Present-day resonance magnetometers form a very broad class of instruments capable of almost any magnetic-field measurement, especially since the advent of new types having a sensitivity of some 10-10G. However, the wide variety of existing devices makes any comparison between them difficult. This review will therefore put emphasis on the principles of operation and general properties of resonance magnetometers, rather than give many details on models already described in previous surveys such as the one (1967) by Grivet and Malnar [1]. The background thus provided will be applied to a more specific study of existing types."
"Magnetometers of remarkable sensitivity utilizing superconducting quantum flux detectors have recently become available. The mechanisms of operation and the present capabilities of these magnetometers and related instruments are described from an elementary viewpoint."
 "The feasibility of a low-temperature beam-addressable memory utilizing EuO films doped with iron and excess europium as the storage medium is dependent upon the chemical stability of the divalent state of europium. The stability of such EuO films covered with a protective layer of Eu2O3has been examined as a function of temperature in various oxidizing atmospheres. The degradation of the films was monitored by measuring optical absorption and transmission, Faraday rotation, coercive force, hysteresis loop squareness, Curie temperature, and lattice constant as the films were progressively aged. The results show that these protected EuO films are stable even in oxidizing atmospheres and at high temperatures relative to the operating temperatures which would be required for a beam-addressable file based on this material."
"This paper introduces the following group of four papers, which review recent advances in selected areas of magnetometry: superconducting, thin film, resonance, and fluxgate. In addition, it refers to several other methods for measuring the magnetic field, pointing out their special utilities and any recent developments. A comparison of some of the performance characteristics of most types of magnetometers in use today is also presented."
"The magnetic properties of the rare-earth metals and a number of the alloy and compound systems formed with rare earths are discussed. Emphasis is placed on current experimental results of bulk magnetic measurements and related transport phenomena and their bearing on theoretical studies. Topics covered include exchange interactions, magnetization processes, crystal field effects and anisotropy, magnetostriction, spin structures and their field dependence, specific heat, optical effects, resistivity, magnetoresistivity, and other transport properties affected by the magnetic order. Examples are drawn from a number of material systems including ionic compounds, solid solution compounds (e.g., rare-earth magnetic semiconductors), intermetallic compounds (permanent magnet materials, etc.), and bubble domain materials in addition to the rare-earth elements and intra-rare-earth alloys. Tables are presented giving the spin structures, ordering temperatures, saturation and effective moments, and other properties of the elements and specific compounds."
"Fluxgate magnetometers, introduced in the 1930's, continue to be used in a variety of applications, such as magnetic air-borne detection, search and surveillance operations, nondestructive testing of materials, palaeomagnetism, and exploration of magnetic fields in space. This paper discusses recent analyses of fluxgate operation, the development of highly stable sensors for absolute measurement of weak fields, and the development of compact inexpensive low-power devices for various search and surveillance operations and for aspect sensing."
"Lithium ferrites are low-cost materials which are attractive for microwave device applications. For a number of years these materials have been prominent in the computer core industry because of excellent temperature performance and the squareness of their hysteresis loops. Previous attempts at exploiting lithium ferrites for microwave applications have met with limited success. Properties which required further improvements were the dielectric and magnetic loss tangents, anisotropy, coercive force, and density. This paper reports primarily the development of microwaveS- andC-band lithium ferrites with substantially improved properties, comparable to those of the more expensive ferrimagnetic garnets currently in use. Extensive applications are also expected for higher frequencies up to and including Kuband. Because a number of factors can affect the performance of microwave devices, the lithium ferrites reported herein are heavily doped to optimize the numerous properties of interest. The following additives were employed: 1) Ti-to tailor saturation magnetization for various frequencies; 2) Zn-for its beneficial effects on coercive force, magnetic loss, and densification; 3) Mn-to decrease the dielectric loss, improve the remanence, and reduce the stress sensitivity of the remanence; 4) Co-to provide a range of spinwave linewidths ; 5) Ni-for increased remanence ; and 6) Bi (the most important additive)-to increase the densification at low firing temperatures and thereby provide low dielectric loss and low coercive force. The microwave lithium ferrites offer a high degree of latitude for tailoring various parameters for special device requirements. However, the optimization of selected properties is sometimes accomplished at the expense of other properties. Although this investigation was directed mainly toward applications for latching devices, lithium ferrites have been altered for use in a variety of devices such as limiters and circulators. The requirements for ferrite materials in latching phasers are reviewed, the compositional factors which result in useful properties are discussed, and performance in circulators and latching phasers is reported."
"Some recent work on the magnetooptical properties of magnetic insulators and semiconductors is reviewed. Emphasis is placed on understanding the atomic origin of the Faraday and Kerr effects in terms of molecular-orbital energy levels. The classes of materials discussed are chromium trihalides, orthoferrites, garnets, ferrites, chromium spinels, and divalent europium compounds."
"Thin magnetic-film magnetometers used for magnetic-field measurement are reviewed and compared. A large variety of magnetic thin-film magnetometers have been constructed, and in some cases their properties are unique. A summary of thin-film magnetometers and their performance is provided."
"A brief review of magnetic structures determined by neutron-diffraction techniques is presented with particular emphasis on developments in the past few years. A number of recent experimental advances are described, including improvements in monochromators, the technique of neutron polarization analysis, and the profile-fitting method for analysis of neutron powder data. Theoretical aspects discussed are the application of magnetic symmetry and representation theory to the determination of magnetic structures. Magnetic structures of a wide range of materials of general interest are described. These include transition metal compounds with rock-salt, rutile, and hematite-type structures, spinels, perovskites, transition metals and alloys, rare-earth metals and alloys, actinide compounds, and compounds with one- and two-dimensional magnetic properties. Up-to-date data for about 200 of these compounds are summarized in tabular form."
"Recent advances in the theory and application of dynamic magnetoelastic coupling in single-crystal ferromagnets and antiferromagnets are reviewed. As background, a linear model of a magnetoelastic ferromagnet is constructed by demanding that the small-signal equations lead to small-signal power-energy and stress-momentum conservation. Self-consistent boundary conditions are also discussed. Magnetoelastic excitations are reviewed both as waves and quasiparticles and coupled-mode analysis is used to describe the propagation of spin-elastic waves in a crystal subjected to time-varying and/or space-varying magnetic bias fields. In such cases, the character of a wave packet can change. This is especially true for longitudinal-elastic/spin waves propagating in yttrium iron garnet (YIG). Microwave and optical experiments dealing with this important case are recounted; the latter demonstrates that strong Bragg scattering of coherent 1150-nm wavelength laser radiation can be used to allow one to \"see\" the microwave (1.5 GHz) spin/elastic conversion in detail."
"In recent years, optical methods have been accepted as a useful means for studying the magnetic properties in solids. In this paper it will be shown, from an introductory point of view, what kind of information optical studies can provide. The most numerous investigations have been performed with insulating materials. The observed phenomena can be divided into four types: first those where spectra can be described by a simple molecular field picture; second those where one incorporates small quantities of magnetic ions into a diamagnetic host and studies the spectra of various neighbour configurations; third those where one deals with the simultaneous excitation of states in the electronic system (excitons) and the spin system (magnons) which gives rise to the so-called magnon sidebands in absorption and emission spectra; and fourth those which deal with the exchange of energy between various magnetic sublattices by the magnetic interactions. Much less information is available on magnetic semiconductors. Yet here a very striking and perhaps technologically important effect has been observed, namely a considerable red shift of the absorption edge in going through the magnetic transition temperature, e.g., in EuO and EuS. In metals, so far only a few experiments have been performed, and only those on Ni and MnAg are mentioned here. In addition, the question of short-range correlations, which can be observed via optical spectra will be discussed. Finally, recent reviews in this field will be compiled to facilitate a deeper understanding."
"Two equivalent theoretical models of permanent magnets are used to develop algorithms for numerically computing the magnetic scalar potential and the magnetic vector potential in the vicinity of an axially symmetric array of pole pieces and permanent magnets. A computer program based on these algorithms calculates equipotential surfaces and flux lines in and around the magnets and pole pieces. In deriving the algorithm for numerically calculating the vector potential a relationship between the magnetic scalar potential and the vector potential was found which enables the program to calculate the vector potential from the scalar potential distribution and thus generate equipotentials and flux lines with only one iterative calculation. An algorithm which calculates the scalar potential of a \"floating\" pole piece, that is, one on which the scalar potential has not been specified, is developed. The vector potential around the pole piece is determined from the scalar potential calculation, and this information is used to calculate the vector potential and the flux lines within the pole piece. The computer program calculates the coordinates of all points at which the equipotential lines and flux lines cross the Liebmann net. This information is fed to a cathode ray tube plotter which generates a field plot. To deal with systems in which macroscopic currents are present as well as permanent magnets, the iterative Liebmann net calculation of the vector potential is developed, and a method of applying Neumann boundary conditions to the vector potential at high-permeability surfaces is described."
"Changes in magnetization with temperature are of concern to the engineer designing permanent magnet devices. Of particular interest are the reversible and irreversible losses which occur when a magnet is heated to a slightly elevated temperature. In this paper the nature of the irreversible magnetization losses which occur when Co-Sm and other cobalt-rare-earth permanent magnets are heated above room temperature are discussed. It is shown that the losses are dependent upon the operating point of the demagnetization curve, and also that post-sintering thermal processing can play a significant role in controlling the changes in magnetization with temperature. Data are given on the effect of composition and high-temperature aging and cooling rate on the irreversible losses. Measurements of demagnetization curves at temperatures up to 200°C are given for a Co-Sm magnet and the data is related to the irreversible losses."
"Single-crystal manganese zinc ferrites containing excess Fe2O3were prepared by a modified Verneuil method. The magnetic properties measured on single-crystal"
"Thinner media yield narrower output pulses, and in many low density digital recorders this leads to better performance. In high density applications, however, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is of greater importance than pulsewidth. The SNR depends on both the write process and the origin of the dominant noises. Several types of media noise, reproduce head, and electronic noises are discussed. A method of determining the media thickness yielding the highest SNR is outlined. The results are dependent upon the noise sources and we conclude that a generally valid rule cannot be given. In some cases a thicker medium may be preferable to a thinner one and vice versa."
"A model for low frequency rotational switching of the magnetization in magnetic materials, leading to individualM-Hcurves, is given. Magnetocrystalline and stress induced anisotropy energies are averaged under the assumption of strong intergranular interaction. Consideration is given to the manner in whichM-Hcurve characteristics are related to such factors as crystallite orientation, mechanical stresses, and material constantsK_{1}, \\lambda_{100}, and λ111."
"Magnetic repulsion is currently under active consideration as a means for providing quiet, frictionless suspension for future tracked ground transportation vehicles and for providing high-reliability, long-lived, friction-free bearings for unique new devices and components. Analytical and experimental results indicate that the superior intrinsic magnetic properties of certain members of a new class of permanent magnet materials, the rare-earth-cobalts (including PrCo5and SmCo5), have intrinsic magnetic properties that make them outstanding candidates for such applications. Experimental results verify analytical predictions that repulsive force characteristics of permanent magnet pairs are critically dependent on intrinsic magnetic properties. The repulsive force is shown to be proportional to the product of the magnetizationsMM'of the opposing magnets, which, in turn, depend on the magnetization versus demagnetizing field (MversusH) characteristics of the magnets. It is predicted that magnets will produce repulsive force in total demagnetizing fields less than their intrinsic coercive force |HT|<MHc; i.e., their intrinsic coercive force can be considered the limiting field value for repulsion operation. Permanent magnet materials suitable for repulsion applications include the barium ferrites and platinum cobalt as well as the rare-earth-cobalts. The intrinsic characteristics of the Alnicos make them unsuitable for repulsion applications. Experiments show that PrCo5magnets having twice the residual magnetization Mrof oriented barium ferrite magnets of similar size and shape produce four times the repulsive force. PrCo5magnets with maximum theoretical magnetization would provide about eleven times the repulsive force of similar barium ferrite magnets."
"A new group of magnetic circuits that can count the number of magnetic bubbles and display them in any binary, ternary, ..., decimal basis is proposed. Feasibility of the concept was demonstrated by successful operation of a binary counter circuit. A design of a decimal counter is given."
"Single-current propagation circuits cause circular magnetic domains in a uniaxial ferrimagnetic wafer to move continuously by properly combining dynamic and static forces which vary periodically with distance. The dynamic force is due to a current and varies periodically with time at a frequencyf. The static force has a spatial period one-half the period of the dynamic force. The static force may be produced by a periodic array of Permalloy elements or by a periodic modulation of wafer thickness. The general principle is discussed and a simple mathematical model is used to indicate the optimum amplitude and phase of the static force relative to the dynamic force. Single-current propagation circuits [1] cause circular magnetic domains in a uniaxial ferrimagnetic wafer to move continuously by properly combining dynamic and static forces which vary periodically with distance and have an average value of zero. The dynamic force is due to a current and varies periodically with time at a frequencyf. The second is static and has a spatial period one-half the period of the dynamic force. The static force may be produced by a periodic array of Permalloy elements [2], [3] or by a periodic modulation of wafer thickness [4]. The general principle is outlined in Figs. 1 and 2."
"This paper presents the results of an investigation of a high density magnetic recording technique utilizing a thin film recording head and a transverse mode of recording on thin media. The significant results of this investigation are as follows. 1) Densities as high as 18 500 transitions per inch were experimentally written in a 300-Å thick FeCr medium having an Hcof 70 oersteds. 2) These densities were written with a thin film, vapor-deposited, recording head having a MATED-FILM® structure with a 0.4-mil etched gap. 3) Track widths of 1-mil on 2-mil centers were experimentally achieved. 4) Optical readout of a 0.2-mil wide transition (width of beam) region corresponding to 5000 transitions per inch was achieved using a laser beam and a linear motion transport system under ideal experimental conditions. 5) The magnetic field from the Néel wall separating recording domains was detected using a MATED-FILM Etched Gap head making this a possible readout method. Maximum achieved linear bit densities as a function of recording media coercivities are given."
"The noise mechanism in a well-designed magnetometer is shown to be due to small-scale magnetic moments which are probably small volumes of the core material that are not oriented by the drive field. Design developments include the sense coil radius and the development of a drive waveform which yields considerably improved performance over the commonly used sine wave drive."
"All the functions essential for the operation of a memory (viz., storage, access, write, read, and detection) can be performed within a bubble-domain memory chip. This enables the design of a memory with a minimum number of peripheral circuits and interconnections, and a short access time. It is conceivable to achieve a 106-bit memory with fewer than 20 circuits (and interconnections), and with a few hundreds of microseconds access time. The present paper describes the devices required to implement such a memory, experimental data to demonstrate the operability of such devices, and the design criteria."
"The low-field anhysteresis of small equidimensional multidomain particles of Fe3O4is found to be surprisingly large. For particle sizes below about 0.075 μm the anhysteretic susceptibility equals or surpasses that of elongated or doped equidimensional single-domain γFe2O3particles used in conventional recording tapes."
"Samples of Epstein size (305 mm × 30mm × 0.3 mm) of Goss-oriented silicon-iron sheet have been subjected to static bending sufficient to cause longitudinal curvature of up to 4 m-1. The relationship between bending moment and curvature, expressed in terms of a so-called bending modulus with the dimensions of Young's modulus, is shown to be nonlinear. The nonlinearity is due to a combination of a) the interaction between magnetostrictive and elastic effects in the material (ΔE effect), and b) the effect of anticlastic curvature, which depends on the dimensions of the sheet. Both effects are examined theoretically. Changes of bending modulus of up to about ±16% were measured on the small samples, in agreement with theory; and changes of up to + 29% are tentatively predicted for large sheets."

"An ac bias operated multivibrator for dc to polyphase conversion is presented. The multivibrator introduced here is of multicore construction, having the number of saturable cores equal to the number of phases. It has several common windings wound through all the cores and two or more separate windings wound on each of the cores. A multivibrator is constructed with the common windings and two transistors. Of the separate windings, one, acting as a bias winding, is connected to one of the common windings to receive ac bias mmf, and the others are used as output windings. By keeping the proper distribution of mmf's among the bias windings, the proper sequence is kept among the induced emf's in the output windings, and hence the polyphase voltages are produced. The same principle can be applied to a polyphase multivibrator with a multiaperture core."
"A series resonantL-Ccircuit connected in series with the SCR provides a simple and reliable means of commutating the thyristor in a dc-dc chopper. By having the load connected in parallel with the resonant circuit and a diode shunting the capacitor, a Fixed SCR commutating voltage is maintained over a wide range of loads. An experimental model circuit was successfully operated withL-R, dc motor, and battery loads. In addition, the actual observed waveforms correspond closely with waveforms plotted with a digital computer simulation of the circuit."
"The exciting current characteristic is suggested as a new method of evaluating the core characteristic. The phase shifting characteristic and the difference between a positive and negative waveform of a balanced half-wave type magnetic phase shifter are calculated by using the exciting current characteristics of cores employed in it. From these theoretical analyses, it can be determined that the difference of a positive and negative waveform is caused by a difference of exciting current characteristics of two cores used in it, and it becomes larger in proportion to larger control-circuit resistance. An experiment was performed using two pairs of cores, in which one pair of exciting currents are identical and the other pair differ. Theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental results."
"A flyback step-up dc-to-dc power converter is modeled utilizing a linear magnetic core, transistor switch, diode, filter capacitance, and load resistance. Assuming constant voltage drops across the semiconductor elements when conducting, the circuit is analyzed to obtain an equation for the required number of turns, subject to the constraints of specified output voltage, operating frequency, maximum winding factor, maximum and minimum input voltage, output power, and flux density. Using an interpretive language, a program has been written to run on a minicomputer which searches a data base of magnetic core characteristics obtained from commercial core catalogs and prints a list of windable cores. In an evaluation section of the program, a core from the windable core list is selected by the designer and the losses in the various elements, along with maximum and minimum transistor current are computed. Another program is used to display on a computer graphics device the loci of maximum and minimum flux density in a selected core as functions of input voltage and output power in a perspective plot. Converter circuits derived from this computer-aided design procedure when tested in the laboratory have yielded data in close agreement with that predicted by the program."
"Some general properties and limits of regulator technology are examined independent of circuit topology or device physics. As foundation, the work of Moore and Wilson on DC-DC conversion circuits is used. Their work showed the need for some intermediate DC-AC inversion in the converter. These findings are extended and applied to a dc-dc regulator, defined as a special network deriving all its power from a bulk source and supplying regulated DC to a load. It is subject to changes in environment bulk voltage fluctuations, load changes, etc. A dc-dc regulation can be performed with maximum efficiency and without circuit redundancy by two classes of regulators. They are the modulated source and modulated transmission regulators. The operating frequency of the modulated source regulator is established via sampled-data theory. A similar constraint on the modulated transmission regulator is governed indirectly, by the Manley-Rowe type power gain relationship."

"The use of X-ray topography to characterize magnetic bubble materials is discussed. By mapping the crystal strains, the technique reveals defects which can influence the bubble domains and which are not easily observed by other methods. Examples of topographs are given for flux grown iron garnets, Czochralski grown Gd3Ga5O12substrate crystals, and LPE iron garnet layers. The influence of substrate defects on the magnetic film is demonstrated. Transmission topographs of substrate-film combinations have not revealed an intermediate layer of misfit dislocations. The application of X-ray topography to a study of the growth induced anisotropy in magnetic garnets is also described. The topographs reveal a correlation between regions having a particular growth band symmetry and those having a particular noncubic anisotropy."
"We have studied the symmetry properties of the in-plane induced magnetic anisotropy in {100} and {110} disks of single crystal YIG epitaxially grown on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates. The ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) technique was used to determine the values of the cubic and induced magnetic anisotropies. The induced anisotropy is interpreted in terms of a magnetostrictive magnetic potential energy. We find that the effective field induced in the plane of the film is isotropic for {100} disks but for {110} disks the induced anisotropy is uniaxial within the plane."
"Magnetic bubble domain films of nominal composition EuEr2 Ga0.7 Fe4.3 O12 have been successfully grown on (111) GGG substrate by the modified dipping technique. [1] Levinstein et al. [1] have reported that Ga/Fe decreases with the temperature of growth of the films. Quantitative results are reported here for the variation of 4πMS, Tc, and the Ga/Fe ratio of the film with the temperature of LPE growth within the supercooled region. A series of films has been grown under identical conditions except for the temperature of the melt, which can be varied within a 45°C range. The thickness, magnetization, and Curie temperature [2] were measured. The Ga/Fe ratio of the films analyzed by the electron microprobe technique varied almost 25% with the change of temperature of the melt. A plot of 4πMS versus Ga/Fe shows nearly linear variation."
"The Seebeck coefficient, or thermoelectric power (TEP), couples the fluctuations in electric current with those of heat transport. We derive a new relationship between the thermoelectric power and the thermal conductivity using the generalized theory of Brownian motion. The TEP temperature derivative in ferromagnets has a singular behavior like that of the specific heat. In antiferromagnets, the singularities in the TEP and in the electrical resistivity temperature derivatives are similar."
"The structure of moving domain walls is obtained by maximizing a Lagrange function, assuming that the film has a uniaxial anisotropy axis in the plane of the film. The variational calculation is based on a class of trial functions previously used for the static case of Dietze and Thomas. The solution applies for wall velocities smaller than a certain critical velocity. At the critical velocity the derivative of the wall energy with respect to velocity becomes infinite and the energy remains finite. For very thick and very thin films the critical velocity calculated with the chosen trial function approaches the critical velocity for bulk material to within one percent. At intermediate film thicknesses, near the transition from a Bloch to a Néel wall, the critical velocity is much smaller (approximately 1/20 of the bulk value in the case of Permalloy). The effective mass per unit area of the wall increases with increasing film thickness for Néel walls and decreases for Bloch walls. This dependence is qualitatively similar to that of the inverse (static) wall width on film thickness, but considerably stronger. Néel walls and Bloch walls in thick films contract with increasing velocity. At intermediate film thicknesses a region exists in which Bloch walls expand slightly with increasing velocity."
"Damped free oscillations of the magnetization have been clearly observed at the completion of 180° flux reversal along both the easy and the hard axis in Ni-Fe thin films. The frequency of these oscillations, as well as their damping, was studied as a function of the applied pulse field and compared to the results obtained by ferromagnetic resonance. Excellent agreement was found for oscillations excited by reversals along the hard axis when the frequency was measured after the amplitude had damped to small amplitudes. Along the easy axis, the free precession frequency was higher than the resonance frequency. An inconclusive attempt was made to associate the strength of the free precession signal with dispersion."
"The rare earth gallium garnets Dy3Ga5O12, Gd3Ga5O12, Sm3Ga5O12, and Nd3Ga5O12used as substrate materials and the magnetic film materials EuEr2GaxFe5-xO12(0 \\leq x \\leq 5) and EuxEr3-xGa0.7Fe4.3O12(0 \\leq x \\leq 3) have been prepared and their lattice parameters measured between room temperature and 1200°C. In the series R3Ga5O12, the room temperature lattice constant decreases linearly in the order Nd>Sm>Gd>Dy. The curve\\Deltaa/a_{0}(a0= lattice constant at 25°C,\\Deltaa= lattice constant - a0versusTshows a very slight concavity over the whole temperature interval with higher values of\\Deltaa/a_{0}in the same order as the room temperature lattice constants. The lattice constants follow Vegard's law with the substitution of europium for erbium in the series EuxEr3-xGa0.7Fe4.3O12and decrease with decreasing europium content. The curves of\\Deltaa/a_{0}have the same shape as the rare earth gallium garnets, but with higher values of\\Deltaa/a_{0}in the opposite order to the room temperature lattice constants. Substitution of gallium for iron in the series EuEr2GaxFe5-xO12caused positive deviation from Vegard's law and a decrease in the room temperature lattice constants. The values of\\Deltaa/a_{0}increase with increasing iron content. The implications of these observations on the properties of magnetic films for bubble domain applications are discussed."
"The pyromagnetic response has been measured for the CoS2-xSexfamily over a selenium concentrationxvarying from 0 to 0.15. As the concentration is initially increased from 0, the pyromagnetic peak increases in height and narrows, which is consistant with a sharpening of the second-order transition. Nearx = 0.1, the response suddenly drops in magnitude by a factor of 15 or so and continues to become narrower. This pyromagnetic behavior appears to be consistant with the onset of thermal hysteresis and a first-order transition nearx = 0.1."
"There have been many studies on the magnetic semiconductor CdCr2Se4which report the large effect of magnetic ordering on its transport properties in the Ga- or In-substituted material. The substituted material shows N-type conduction compared to P-type conduction in the unsubstituted. The electrical resistivity has a maximum near its Curie point, and then decreases with a further increase of temperature. The material has a large negative magnetoresistance effect at its Curie temperature. The present paper reports the transport properties of the material with greater substitution than the previous works. The purpose of this work is to provide the necessary information for the application of the combined effect of magnetism and conduction in ferromagnetic semiconductors. For additional details, see Digests of the 1972 Intermag Conference (available from IEEE Headquarters)."
"Single crystals of CdCr2Se4undergo a transition (\"switching\") from a low conductivity to a high conductivity state at a certain threshold electric field strength, as in Si-doped YIG. The appearing IV characteristics are similar to those of amorphous semiconductors. However, for the crystalline ferri-and ferromagnetic materials this switching is induced by well-defined transitions of electrons from narrowdand forpbands and/or doping levels into an initially unfilled broad conduction band by means of field ionization. In CdCr2Se4this is concluded from the characteristic temperature and magnetic field dependence of all critical electric values for the switching and instabilities which are causing negative resistance slopes. With an electrical field strength kept close to the critical value for switching, pure and doped magnetic semiconducting crystals could be switched to the high conductivity state by an applied magnetic field of less than 1 Vs/m2."
"Domain wall motion in Permalloy films was experimentally studied in pulsed magnetic fields of various pulselength, and it was found that the Bloch-wall displacement is not proportional to the pulselength in the nanoseconds region. The results suggest that the instantaneous wall velocity is not constant for high field, and that the fast wall motion just after the field starts is damped rapidly and then relaxes to steady slow wall motion. This is discussed from the damped and clamping-free domain wall motion theory."
"Domain wall motion excited by slow rise-time, bipolar, hard-axis pulses in vacuum deposited CoNiFe films 1500 Å - 2000 Å thick is studied. The results are consistent with those of comparable NiFe films. Furthermore, the wall coercivity is found to be the most significant sample property correlated to the low-frequency creep properties of all the samples."
"Some aspects of the physics of the recording process of an amorphous semiconductor target in an electron beam memory are described. The fundamental speed-density limitation for this form of memory is given."
"Data illustrating the read-write disturb problem in plated wire memories are reported. It is shown that the application of a dc hard axis field of the order of 1 Oe acting in the same direction as the word pulse can alleviate the disturb. Read-write disturb threshold curves are presented for a variety of pulse sequences incorporating either unipolar or bipolar bit currents. It is found that the second pulse of a bipolar disturb bit current is, for long pulse widths, the most influential. A model, which is based upon an extension of the modified lever mechanism used to explain conventional creep, is proposed. This model can explain all the data. In addition, it predicts that as the bit pulse length is decreased, the bipolar disturb sequence should become less severe. This is observed and, for a pulse width of 50 ns, the disturb threshold moves well above the wall motion current. Finally, a number of methods for increasing operating margins is presented."
"The instrument described here displays in a matter of seconds the real write threshold, creep, and adjacent bit disturb curves of plated wires. The observed curves are the true representation of a dynamic magnetic element affected by its environment. That means one can study the combined effects that keeper, strap configuration, tunnel structure, etc. have on a magnetic element."

"A new technique for the preparation of very homogeneous ferrite powders of compositions in the MgMnZn system is described. It is based on decomposition of a solidified concentrated solution of organometallic salts. During this process no segregation of the components occurs. The benefits resulting from the new process are as follows: 1) Highly rectangular loops with low switching coefficients are obtained. 2) As a result, greater amounts of zinc than heretofore employed can be incorporated into the ferrite before the rectangularity falls to unusable values. 3) Therefore, lower drive currents are made possible without drastic increases in switching time (an 18 mil core with a drive current of 300 mA under the 0.61 disturb condition and a switching time of 280 ns can be produced). 4) Further reductions in switching time can be made by decreasing the rise time and using partial switching. 5) The poorer temperature coefficients that always result with incorporation of zinc can be offset by the inclusion of a small amount of cobalt."
"Mutual interaction of domains in bubble materials causes new types of domain structure. These structures, which are observed in an orthoferrite platelet, are classified into five categories: 1) periodic bubble domains in the valleys of a wavy wall; 2) coexistence of positive and negative bubbles on both sides of a wavy wall; 3) bubbles within a ring domain; 4) concentric ring domains; and 5) coexistence of positive and negative bubbles. Experimental observations by means of magnetooptical effect were performed to investigate the stabilities, controllabilities, and physical properties of the domains. The domain structures 3), 4), 5) are stable even in zero bias field and the structures 1), 2), 3), 5) can be transferred without changing the configuration."
"Epitaxial garnet films containing many different mixtures of the rare earths have been prepared for materials and device characterization. In addition, several different types of circuits for propagating and manipulating bubble domains have been proposed and demonstrated. This paper reviews some of the recent progress in characterizing these circuits and materials with respect to mass memory applications. The approach under consideration utilizes a rotating magnetic field for bubble propagation and pulsed-current conductors for certain control functions, such as bubble generation, bubble annihilation, and bubble transfer from one propagation loop to another. The detection function is done with magnetoresistive elements. Operation at frequencies of at least 100 kHz is desired and has been obtained separately for each of the required functions, using particular combinations of circuits and materials. More detailed characterizations of the materials, the circuits, and their combinations are presently in progress in order to achieve all required functions simultaneously with a single material-circuit combination."
"The dependence of the magnetic properties of iron whiskers upon field, time, and temperature have been determined experimentally using transformer circuits with whiskers as cores. A procedure for obtaining, recognizing, and maintaining the simple Landau domain structure has been found. A mathematical model has been developed which adequately describes most of the experimental observations. Some applications of the understanding gained are mentioned."
"Polycrystalline garnets of the composition Ca3-yYyFe2-xSnxFe1.5+0.5x+0.5y-0.5zGezV1.5-0.5x-0.5y-0.5zO12with0 \\leq x \\leq 1.0, 0 \\leq y \\leq 2.2, and0 \\leq z \\leq 1.0were studied. Narrow linewidth (\\Delta H \\leq 10Oe) could be obtained within the composition range of0.3 \\leq x \\leq 0.4, 1.2 \\leq y \\leq 1.6, and0 \\leq z \\leq 0.8, where the materials had low saturation magnetization and relatively high Curie temperature. From the field dependence of effective linewidth, it was confirmed that the materials with\\Delta H \\leq 10Oe had very high density and small anisotropy field."
"The effect of changes in remanent magnetization on the performance of microwave ferrites employed in latching phase shifter applications has been a serious problem for many years. Reductions in the remanence ratio R are caused both by increases in temperature and by stresses which arise from thermal or mechanical origins. Recently, the molecular field theory developed by Néel has been modified to account for the effects of possible sublattice canting on the magnetization-temperature curves of substituted microwave garnets. The results of this work have made it possible to compute magnetization-temperature characteristics for a wide range of substituted iron garnets. The problem of the stress sensitivity of R has also been examined theoretically, and it has been concluded that the ratio of the magnetostriction constant to the first-order anisotropy constant is the important variable. The magnetostriction constant involved depends on the relationship of the stress direction to the applied magnetic field. In comparison with experimental results for Y3MnxFe5-xO12in both single crystal and polycrystalline forms, the theory was shown to give at least qualitative agreement. This paper will serve as an up-to-date review of this work."
"A small twinned crystal of tetragonal phase CuFe24was obtained, in which tetragonal c axes are almost equally distributed along only two perpendicular directions (taken as Y and Z axes of the crystal). Magnetic torque measurements were made on a small spherical sample (0.63 mm in diameter) at room temperature, 77 K and 4.2 K, and in magnetic fields up to 21 kG. Expressing the uniaxial anisotropy energy (Eu) asE_{u} = K_{1} \\cos^{2} \\theta + K_{2} \\cos^{4} \\theta + K_{3}\\sin^{4} \\theta \\cos^{2} \\phi \\sin^{2} \\phi, K_{1}, K_{2}, and K3were found to equal -8.9 × 105, 11.4 × 105and -8.5 × 105ergs/cc, respectively, at 4.2 K. Their absolute values decrease linearly with temperature. The direction of easy magnetization is not parallel to the c axis but is inclined at about 60°. This inclination is almost independent of temperature."
"To study the mechanism of oxygen binding of hemoglobin and myoglobin the electronic state of the central Fe2+ion was determined by means of magnetic susceptibility measurements. The paramagnetic saturation under high magnetic field of a superconducting magnet and the torque of a single crystal of hemoglobin were also studied. It was found that the fine structure of the lowest ground-state energy level (5B2) of ferrous ion in hemoglobin and myoglobin could be well represented by the spin HamiltonianDS\\min{z}\\max{2} + E(S\\min{x}\\max{2} - S\\min{y}\\max{2}). The value ofDdetermined from the susceptibility measurements and from the field dependence of magnetization was 5 cm-1. From the torque measurements, the values ofDandEwere also estimated to be 5.3 and 0.9 cm-1, respectively."
"A new highly sensitive and reliable NDRO system based on the planar Hall effect has been developed for the purpose of signal detection in the thin film domain-wall motion devices. In this system, the output channel of these devices is placed perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis of the planar Hall element (PHE). The measured maximum sensitivity of signal detection in this system is of the order of 50 mV/A. For the PHE tested, the maximum useful continuous current is 20 mA, and the frequency response is flat at least up to 10 MHz. Upon switching the domain tip at the output channel, a reliable output voltage of 1 mV is obtained for the continuous PHE current of 20 mA in this system. This readout system has been used for signal detection in the domain tip shift register. The output voltage waveforms are shown."
"Controllable domain tip propagation in thin ferromagnetic films can be effectively used for performing iterative process in systems containing arrays of adaptive weights. This paper, along with necessary experimental data and general description of the device with control electronics, contains an analysis of stability conditions for a domain wall arbitrarily positioning in a narrow ferromagnetic channel. It is shown that packing density of the adaptive weights in homogeneous thin-film structures can reach the value of 100 to 200 elements per square centimeter without a deterioration of device basic characteristics. For additional details, please see Digests of the 1972 Intermag Conference (available from IEEE Headquarters)."
"The areas where life sciences and magnetism overlap are reviewed. Direct interactions of magnetic fields on living bodies are described. The interactions of time-varying magnetic fields most probably act through the induced electric currents. The actions of homogeneous and inhomogeneous fields are considered and samples given. Uses of magnetic fields due to currents in living bodies are described, as well as some of the devices and methods through which ferromagnetic materials are artificially introduced into the body."
"Construction and performance of a plated-wire memory plane which consists of the plated wires, glass fiber spacers, and word lines enclosed by a C-shaped Permalloy film keeper, are described. The glass fibers serve as spacers and insulators between plated wires, and also reinforce the plane against external stress, such as bending and compression. The plated wires and glass fibers are sandwiched by two word line arrays. They are bonded with a 0.012 mm thick adhesive layer, including a 0.006 mm thick polyester insulator. The C keeper and the narrow gap between plated wires and word lines in this plane allow a highly concentrated driving field and a low leakage field for the adjacent word, thereby giving a wide performance window and good adjacent word disturb characteristics. The memory plane has a capacity of approximately 30 kbits (256 words × 132 bits). Typical data of this plane is as follows: the word lines are arrayed every 1 mm; the plated-wires are arrayed every 0.5 mm; the minimum output voltage is 3 mV (the rise time of the word current is 70 ns); the available word current is 550-1000 mA; and the available digit current is 40-80 mA."
"The stack processing method is used to compare the cost-performance ($/access) between the following: 1) two-level and three-level hierarchies; and 2) hierarchies using random access and serial access memories as a backing store. It was found that busswidth between levels in the hierarchy strongly affects the system cost-performance, and the access time ratio between the backing store and buffer somewhat less. With the technology cost assumptions used in this study, the three-level hierarchy does not have as good a figure of merit ($/access) as the two-level hierarchy unless the access time ratio exceeds about fifty. Also, random access devices are advantageous over serial access devices for backing store applications only when the memory capacity is less than 1 Mbyte. For capacities of 4 Mbyte and 16 Mbyte serial access stores with shift register lengths of 256 bit and 1024 bit, respectively, look favorable."
"The characteristics of plated wire memories have been improved by the use of flexible ferrite keepers. Though the multilayered film (8900 Å thick) deposited onto 7% Ag-Cu substrate plays the most important part in a plated wire memory, emphasis is placed on the structure of the keeper which made the coupling of word lines with thin film the most effective at the points where cells are formed. With this effect, word current can be reduced approximately 25% and bit density can be increased. High output voltage is a feature of the memory. Figures are presented showing the structure of the keeper and its characteristics in comparison with those of a nonmagnetic keeper. For an application of this memory, a 32 Kbyte memory system is described. High speed (120 ns access, 200 ns read cycle, 375 ns write cycle) is a feature of the system."
"A clear-view bubble-domain shift register with an angelfish pattern sputter etched into the surface of orthoferrite platelets was fabricated and its operation was demonstrated. For a typical Gd-orthoferrite platelet ∼ 70 μm thick, shift register operation was realized with triangles etched to a depth of ∼ 6 μm with an edge gradient of ∼ 1.3. Specimen preparation and device operation are described."
"Over the past decade, many time-domain signal processing functions have been demonstrated at microwave frequencies in bulk single crystals of yttrium iron garnet (YIG). These include pulse compression, variable delay, storage, pulse recall, and pulse frequency changing. However, none has reached product engineering status due to lens effects, low dynamic range, and the very limited range of available parameters which are all manifestations of the nonellipsoidal YIG geometry. In contrast, within the past four years Rayleigh type acoustic waves propagating in piezoelectric crystals at VHF/UHF frequencies have already led to practical devices, notably, color television filters and pulse compression loops. Nevertheless, delay lines exceeding 100 microseconds and programmable rime-domain filters of dynamic range greater than 50 dB have proved difficult to realize. This paper proposes a new approach to harness practically the known versatility of magnetic materials. Rayleigh type acoustic waves are utilized propagating at VHF/UHF frequencies in epitaxial films of YIG possessing ellipsoidal geometry grown on nonmagnetic single crystal substrates. Here acoustic waveguides can be fabricated readily in low loss media by selective etching techniques and programmability obtained by adjustment of the bias magnetic field. In common with acoustic waves in piezoelectrics, the philosophy is adopted that the wave should be predominantly acoustic with an energy admixture of less than 5 percent (in this case magnetic) for transduction and tapping purposes. Examples of the realization of devices for both frequency time-domain processing are delineated, and areas are highlighted where further research is necessary."
"Recent advances in the liquid phase epitaxial growth of rare earth magnetic garnet films have enhanced prospects for a bubble mass memory. It is the purpose of this paper to review the status of materials in order to achieve some perspective. Principal problems are those of uniformity, reproducibility, and defect control. Good uniformity of LPE films has been achieved. Recent phase diagram data based on the garnet oxides in PbO-B2O3fluxes show that high orders of compositional and growth temperature control are required for reproducibility but are within the state of the art. Defect control, which is closely related to dislocation formation, seems not to be a limiting problem, attributable largely to the high energy of formation of dislocations in the garnets. Thus, even interfacial or mismatch dislocations do not form in these heteroepitaxial structures."
"A review of some of the defects that influence magnetic bubble domain motion is presented. The defects are catalogued and their origin and control are briefly discussed. A technique for staining defects by magnetic bubbles is described. The advantages of this technique over the stripe domain approach are listed. Examples of defects stained by the bubble raft technique are presented. The use of garnets for magnetic bubbles has stimulated a considerable amount of effort in understanding and eliminating magnetically active defects. Currently, the level of defects in films produced in this laboratory and elsewhere [1] range from a few to 102defects per square centimeter. In this brief note we review and catalog the nature of defects and the status of our understanding of the origin of defects in garnet substrates and films. We shall also consider the magnetic domain techniques used for staining defects in these materials. This review is limited to defects generated during and up to steps leading to film fabrication that are common to a variety of film growth techniques. It does not include details of defects which are uniquely characteristic of a particular technique. It also does not consider defects introduced during device fabrication such as the metallurgy of the overlay or improper design of the drive pattern."
"The first epitaxial films of bubble domain garnets were prepared by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. However, liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) has rapidly become a very competitive technique. Despite the usefulness of both techniques in preparing research samples, their potential utility as manufacturing methods has yet to be demonstrated. The major portion of this paper presents the current status in this laboratory of the development of CVD as a manufacturing method. Subjects that will be discussed include reactor configurations, best film compositions, composition control, thickness uniformity, defect density, and film production rates. Finally, there will be a discussion of the relative merits of CVD and LPE."
"Studies were made on deflection yoke cores of television sets concerning sweep power, magnetic properties, and shape effects. It was found that the sweep power varied inversely with the permeability of the cores, and that cores with a permeability over 200 were considered to be practical for deflection yoke cores of television sets. The maximum magnetic flux density in a core was about 500 gauss. The sweep current was proportional to the taper angle of tapered cores. A new equation was derived considering the permeability and the dimensions of cores. The calculated values almost agree with the experimental values if the proportional coefficients are determined experimentally. Experimental curves may be found in the 1972 INTERMAG Digest Book."
"It was found that the effective dynamic transverse stiffness of a laminated soft iron core is a function of magnetic bias. The effective dynamic transverse stiffness was observed by building an ultrasonic oscillator using a laminated soft iron core. The laminated core was assembled employing conventional silicon steel transformer laminations. When the core is properly excited by dc pulses, it produces ultrasonic frequency electrical oscillations in the electrical circuit and ultrasonic acoustic emission in the air through the vibrating laminated core. The oscillation frequency is tunable by adjusting the dc magnetic bias. The oscillation frequency is determined by, among other parameters, the effective dynamic transverse stiffness of the core, or the \"spring constant\" of the laminated core system. Ultrasonic frequencies of 9-28 kHz were generated with 100-180 gauss bias. The peak acoustic power was estimated to be 38.8 watts with a peak electrical input power of 150 watts."
"\"Orientcore HI-B\" is a newly developed electrical steel, and has lower iron loss than conventional oriented steel. Owing to the perfectness of Goss texture, HI-B has larger iron loss than conventional electrical steel in the crossrolling direction of the steel. Experimental results for model transformers show that the effect of the increased crossrolling direction loss is practically negligible, except for the 90°-joint lamination core."
"It has been generally believed that the magnetic levitation of trains of the induction-repulsion type needs large ampere turn on the train magnets, and only superconductive magnets make the magnetic levitation feasible. However, the magnetic levitation becomes feasible also with the normal conductive electromagnet if the iron magnetic path is properly provided. An experimental example has been investigated. For details, see Digests of the 1972 Intermag Conference (available from IEEE Headquarters)."
 "Radio frequency absorption is investigated with respect to the application of anisotropy measurements of cylindrical films, by comparison with both a modified IEEE standard method and the single-domain theory of small signal susceptibility. Two experimental applications are shown: the influence of a finite axial film's length on the effective anisotropy field and measurement of the separate anisotropies of the layers in a multilayer film."
"For the measurement of the magnetic field intensity Hmin the materials of permanent magnet systems, a new potential measuring coil (PMC) is proposed consisting of a nonmagnetic thin rod fitted with windings of constant winding density which is long enough to assume one end to be in a field free space when its other end is placed on points whose potentials are to be measured. A fluxmeter connected to the PMC and set to zero when the measuring end of the PMC is placed on a certain point of the magnet indicates the magnetic potential relative to this point when moved to other points of the magnet. The PMC can also be used for recording of equipotential lines of magnetic fields."
"An experimental comparison of the recording density limits of three coding methods was performed to find the coding method most suitable for high density recording. We examined FM, MFM, and one of the so-called run-length-limited codes to which self-clocking and peak detection are applicable. In this paper, we call the last coding method \"modified nonreturn to zero inverted\" (MNRZI). The recording density limit was obtained for each method from measurement of the peak shift and signal to noise ratio for a given recording channel."
"Ternary and quaternary A-15 type compounds, Nb3Al1-yMy(M=Be,B) and (Nb1-xTax)3Al1-yGey, were investigated in the composition range where the A-15 structure was stable. The superconducting critical temperatures of these compounds were measured as a function of composition (x and y), lattice constant, and condition of heat treatment. It was found that the critical temperature can be enhanced up to near 20 K by substituting Al for the quest elements in a stoichiometric compound Nb3Al. Magnetic field dependences of the critical current density were also discussed for as-cast and aged samples."
"The cubic interstitial nitride of niobium has been of interest recently because of its high transition temperature (≃ 16K). It has been known that NbN in a bulk state shows a poor critical current carrying capacity of 103A/cm2. However, it was found that NbN films prepared by reactive sputtering exhibit much larger Jcand critical field Hc2as compared to those of the bulk. In the present paper, we report the anisotropies in the critical currents of NbN films prepared by reactive sputtering. The effects of the substrate and annealing on the anisotropies are also investigated. For additional details, see Digests of the 1972 Intermag Conference (available from IEEE Headquarters)."
"The memory elements are described in detail for a magnetic thin film memory plane and system, which is a practical example of the fine striped memory (FSM). The present FSM element is of destructive readout (DRO) with a good margin for digit and adjacent word disturbances. The memory plane has 512 words and 72 bits with two crosspoints per bit, and has an economical manufacturing feasibility. The memory module has a 16 kbyte capacity, a good signal-to-noise ratio, and provides a read-write cycle time of 250 ns."
"It has been discovered that a ferromagnetic film plated in a constant magnetic field, much smaller than the coercive force of the film, is magnetized in the same direction as the applied magnetic field. It is considered that the magnetization of the film is fixed when the plated particles grow from a superparamagnetic state to a ferromagnetic state. A new duplication method for magnetic recordings is proposed as an application of this phenomenon. The method may be utilized to make master tapes with high coercive force by means of duplication from ordinary magnetic tapes with low coercive force. Considerable studies have been made on metallic films for high density recording in the past several years. The films are in most cases prepared by electrolytic or electroless deposition and vacuum evaporation [1,2]. Co-(P) or Co-Ni-(P) films are used to some extent on magnetic drums and disks. Magnetic properties such as induced anisotropies have been investigated for these ferromagnetic films prepared in a magnetic field [3]. In the present study it has been discovered that a ferromagnetic film deposited in a constant magnetic field, much smaller than the coercive force of the film, is magnetized in the same direction as the applied field. A new duplication method is proposed as an application of this phenomenon. An anhysteretic duplication is usually used for contact printing of magnetic tape recordings [4]. The signal is transferred when a master tape contacts a slave tape in an alternate magnetic field. However, master signals must be recorded with a special machine and copies may be made only on tapes with lower coercive force. A feature of the present method is that duplication is possible from low coercivity tapes to high coercivity tapes. In this paper the magnetization mechanism of the ferromagnetic films electrodeposited in a magnetic field was investigated and several duplication characteristics were measured for audio signals."
"To develop a flexible-disk magnetic memory, an experimental investigation of a new type of noncontact suspension mechanism for the flexible disk has been carried out. This suspension mechanism has an aerodynamic step thrust bearing and an aerodynamic cylindrical thrust bearing in which the magnetic heads are imbedded. The flexible disk is set between the bearings. Rotational motion of the flexible disk generates aerodynamic pressure between the flexible disk and the bearings, and keeps a small stable clearance ranging from 5 μm to 10 μm between the flexible disk and the magnetic heads. A prototype model of the flexible-disk memory has been manufactured. This model has a thin disk of mylar coated by conventional γ-oxide magnetic layer (100 mm in diameter, 33 μm in thickness). One track is capable of storing about 2000 bits. The maximum number of tracks is 36. The rotational speed of the disk is 1500 r/m or 3000 r/m. No decrease of readout signal was observed during the shock test in which the model was subjected to more than 20 G external acceleration."
"The introduction of redundant magnetic transition pairs in data cells, normally encoded with absent transitions, counteracts the effects of pulse crowding. Such pulse crowding is generally encountered in conventional saturation type magnetic recording. The resulting restored waveform is in fair agreement with the synthesized waveform based upon pulse superposition. The technique may be applied to most commonly used recording schemes, thereby realizing increased bit density or greater head-to-medium separation."
"A description of the design and technology of batch-fabricated core-like memory elements is presented. A bottom FeSi and a top NiFe layer form a closed-flux path encircling two mutually insulated conductor layers. All layers are deposited on a silicon chip and structured by photolithographic techniques. The compatibility with integrated circuits is pointed out. Element densities may be as high as 20 000/cm2. Due to the small dimensions, currents are below 50 mA with a switching time of about 100 ns. The output voltage is between 5 and 10 mV."
"The fine striped memory completely satisfies the conditions required on magnetic random access memory such as high speed, small size, and low cost. Adoptions of the formation of complete flux path closure on the digit lines, the introduction of the batch fabrication technique, and the use of a flux keeper on the word lines allow this memory to accomplish outstanding performance. At present, however, size and cost of peripheral parts are not practical. A problem which still remains is to design the entire system more compactly and economically. This paper introduces an approach to a 4 kword 32 bit DRO fine striped memory for this purpose. The memory stack consists of memory planes (1.6 × 120 × 310 mm). Each plane has one digit sheet sandwiched between two word sheets. A group of digit lines (70 μm wide, 100 μm pitch) is batch fabricated on a glass substrate (1 × 40 × 120 mm). The development of the heat ray soldering technique ensured the connection of digit lines in a short time and high reliability. On a word sheet, 64 IC modules are mounted and four sponge buffer backed ferrite flux keepers are glued. The word lines (100 μm diameter, 350 μm pitch) are inserted in the grooves of the flux keeper. Under 300 mA word current (30 ns rise time) and ± 15 mA digit current, output in the worst condition was minimum ± 1.5 mV."
"This paper reports the improvements of the NDRO characteristics in the FSM element achieved with combined application of multilayer film technology and topography control, and an improved process in forming the closed flux path structure. To form the adaptable closed flux path structure the following multistep procedure was developed: 1) deposition of magnetic film on the insulating surface; 2) deposition of Cu stripes over the film; 3) further deposition of magnetic fdm; and 4) removal of magnetic film between stripes by photoetching to form independent digit stripes. This improved method ensures a complete closed flux path between the magnetic films at the bottom and top. Thus, uniform memory characteristics and reproducibility are achieved. The bottom magnetic film is a four-layer film composed of Ni-Fe and Ni-Co films. On this film, Cu stripes, 2 μm thick and 100 μm wide, are deposited. Furthermore, a Ni-Fe film, 1 μm thick, is deposited. Nodules, 1-1.5 μm in diameter, formed on the Cu stripes by controlling deposition conditions, provide the top magnetic film with NDRO characteristics through the topography effect. The sense signal at 4 mV output from two intersections per bit is obtained with a word current at 150 mA having a rise time of 25ns."
"Vacuum magnetic fields appear suitable for the confinement of highly energetic plasmas for times that may become adequate to make controlled thermonuclear reactors scientifically feasible. To achieve satisfactory confinement, these magnetic fields must possess certain characteristics. The properties that toroidal magnetic fields must have are reviewed and examples presented of apparatus in use in the laboratory to provide these magnetic fields."
"Magnetic properties of VnO2n-1system, which shows the temperature induced metal insulator phase transition at Tt, were studied by the measurement of magnetic susceptibility and Mössbauer effect. It was observed that V3O5, V4O7, V5O9, V6O11, V7O13, and V8O15order anti-ferromagnetically at 70, 40, 30, 23, 51, and 7 K, respectively. V3O5behaves like a low dimensional antiferromagnet. V7O13is a metallic antiferromagnet. Above Tt(metallic phase) the total susceptibility χmolcan be represented by χmol= Cobs/ T-θ + χ0. Cobsis in a good agreement with calculated value Ccal, assuming that the material is ionic (V+3and V+4in a paramagnetic state). Density of electronic state of Fermi levelD_{(\\epsilon_{f})_{x}_{0}was calculated from χ0assuming Pauli paramagnetism and compared with theD_{(\\epsilon_{f})_\\gammaobtained by specific heat measurement."
"A review is given of the magnetoelectric (ME) effect. Topics covered include thermodynamic formulation, magnetic symmetry and magnetoelectricity, experimental considerations and known ME materials, atomic mechanisms responsible for magnetoelectricity and the temperature dependence of the ME susceptibility, and present and potential applications in materials research and devices. It is pointed out that ME measurements can be useful in magnetic structure and Néel temperature determinations, studies of critical behavior, changes in magnetic symmetry induced by external fields, and studies of the motion of antiferromagnet domain walls. Among potential device applications of ME materials are a realization of the gyrator and read-only memories with subnanosecond retrival times."
"A small, extremely simple magnetometer has been developed for use in metal detecting devices. It is a ring-core fluxgate type employing a small Permalloy-tape bobbin core purchased commercially. When the magnetometer is used in low ambience or as a dc field null detector, the intrinsic noise can be as low as 0.1 gamma in a one hertz passband. For additional details, see Digests of the 1972 Intermag Conference (available from IEEE Headquarters)."
"The demagnetization properties of a series of sintered Co-Sm magnets have been measured over the range 0 to 750 K. The intrinsic coercive force of the samples varied from 19 to 65 kOe at 27 K, but decreased with increasing temperature to zero at about 700 K. The change of relative coercivity, Hci(T)/Hci(77 K), with temperature was the same for all the samples. Thus, it appears that the factors which influence the magnitude of coercivity do not influence the temperature dependence."
"To study the sintering kinetics of prealloyed and mixed powders to total Sm content between 33.8 and 40 wt%, continuous heating and isothermal runs were performed in a photosintering furnace between 1020 and 1160°C. Computed apparent activation energies and sintering rates indicate that no single mechanism can explain the sintering behavior. While solid state diffusion dominates in prealloyed powders, the liquid phase plays an important role in the powder mixes. A model based on a diffusion mechanism is suggested, in which a concentration- and temperature-dependent preexponential term in the diffusion equation leads to a high apparent activation energy."
"From the study of the intermetallic compounds of YCo5, LaCo5, and PrCo5, it has been determined that these compounds crystallize in the hexagonal CaCu5structure. It has been reported that they have very high magnetocrystalline anisotropies and high saturation magnetizations. Especially, YCo5and PrCo5, compounds have higher saturation values and theoretical energy products than those of SmCo5. This experimental work is done with the intention of investigating: a) the magnetic properties of liquid phase sintered magnets of Sm1-xPrxCo5, and b) the change of X-ray diffraction patterns, lattice parameters, and magnetic properties of YCo5and LaCo5, during the liquid phase sintering process. For additional details, see Digests of the 1972 Intermag Conference (available from IEEE Headquarters)."
"Cu- and Fe-modified CeCo5magnets were prepared by a sintering technique, and their magnetic properties were studied. They exhibited an extremely square hysteresis loop and 12 MG.Oe maximum energy product."
"A simple analytic criterion is developed which determines the focusing or defocusing of near axis magnetostatic spin waves propagating in a cylindrically symmetric ferromagnet. The crystal is assumed to be magnetically saturated by an axial magnetic field which, due to nonzero volume divergence of the magnetization, is in general, non-Laplacian in character. In addition, both magnetic dipolar coupling and variation of the angle between the magnetization vector and the local propagation vector are included in the model, which thus extends the analytic work of previous authors. The asymptotic behavior of the spin wave trajectories is found to predict either focusing or defocusing. In analogy to under- and over-damped resonators, the former occurs either by the monotonic or damped oscillatory approach of a ray toward the axis; the condition for critical damping is also given. The theory is applied to the case of a magnetically saturated YIG cylinder of commonly employed dimensions (3 mm d. × 10 mm)."
"The PrCo5and (MM)Co5powders obtained by splat cooling are found to have very large coercive forces. Small grains of 1-5 μm in size are produced in particles of 1-40 μm. Simple binding of these particles under ∼ 27 KOe leads to coercive fields as large as 9 KOe for PrCo5and 5 kOe for (MM)Co5, which are higher than the largest values reported for the conventionally fabricated magnets. The SmCo5powders made by this process, however, do not yield a larger coercive field. In splat cooling, particles are subject to much less surface defects than that encountered in the conventional grinding process. Also, some degree of preferential growth of the grains appears to result from the high thermal gradient between the liquid alloy and the substrait. In addition, a second phase was found to form surrounding the RCo5phase, which may have improved the surface properties of the RCo5phase. Since the presence of the second phase has been shown to have advantages to the sintering process for some high quality magnets of SmCo5and PrCo5, it is expected that liquid sintering of fine powders prepared by this new process would lead to greater improvement of magnetic properties."
"A 6 GHz improved rotating field phaser, which consists of a circular waveguide loaded with a ferrite tube containing a metal rod coaxially, is described. In order to design the phaser, the differential phase shifts of the phaser have been calculated by a perturbation method under some assumptions, resulting in good approximate values. The phaser constructed for trial is shown to have an insertion loss of less than 0.6 decibels over an 8 percent frequency band."
"We made a stripline-type ferrite tuner with polycrystalline CaV garnet at UHF band. The properties of the ferrite disk were first evaluated in a bandstop filter configuration. The effective line width was measured as a function of both frequency andt/Dover the band 100-4000 MHz, and we discussed the necessary conditions for making a narrow filter with small insertion loss at low frequency. The coupling theory of the ferrite tuner together with the theoretical equation of the external Q are presented. The experimental values of the external Q almost coincides with the theoretical ones. Tests of this tuner resulted in an insertion loss is 1.9-2.5 dB, a bandwidth of 20-30 MHz, and an attenuation at the image frequency of more than 30 dB. The performance of higher modes is also discussed."
"A thin magnetic film shift register can be operated with high reliability by providing the high coercive force at the edges of the channel; which can be realized by the following three methods. 1) A Permalloy is evaporated onto a substrate masked by a nonmagnetic metal pattern which is placed a very small distance from the substrate. 2) As complicated channels cannot be constructed with method 1), double layers, which consist of an aluminum and a copper, are utilized. After evaporation of a Permalloy onto the entire double layer, an aluminum and a copper are etched away in caustic soda. 3) As the coercive force of the Permalloy film with the aluminum underlayer is high, the edges of the channels are made using double layer construction. An operating speed of ∼1 MHz is obtained and maximum storage is about 2000 bit/cm2."
"The magnetostriction constant λ111and λ100, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant K1, and the resonance linewidths ΔH111and ΔH100of CdCr2Se4and CdCr2S4have been measured by the ferromagnetic resonance technique at 9.5 GHz at 4.2 K. The crystals were grown by closed-tube vapor transport using CrCl3, and the samples for the measurements were subjected to different heat treatments after being shaped into spheres. The values of K, λ, and ΔH were found to depend strongly on the thermal history of the crystals; the presence of Cr2+always increased the absolute values of K, λ, and ΔH. The contribution of the dipole interactions between the Cr3+ions to the magnetostriction constants were calculated and found to be an order of magnitude greater than the very small values measured for the selenium-annealed crystals."
"In a previous work measurements of the magnetization and the torque of light rare earth cobalt compounds RCo5and YCo5were done on their single crystal spheres to obtain some magnetic data such as magnetic moments, easy direction, and anistropy constants. In the present report the same measurements have been performed on the single crystal spheres of heavy rare earth cobalt compounds GdCo5, TbCo5, DyCo5, HoCo5, and ErCo5for almost the same purpose. For additional details, see Digests of the 1972 Intermag Conference (available from IEEE Headquarters)."
"The intermetallic phases formed between the rare earth metals (R) and the elements of the 3-d transition series are a large group of new substances with interesting magnetic properties. They have been studied intensely in the last decade. Their properties are reviewed with a view toward their usefulness for permanent magnets. Some aspects of the recently developed magnets based on certain RCo5compounds are discussed. The prediction is made that second-generation rare earth magnets can be developed using R2(Co,Fe)17alloys. These should have energy products and thermal stability superior even to sintered SmCo5, while being less expensive. Experimental evidence supporting this claim is discussed."
"For a magnetooptic memory with nonholographic Curie temperature writing and Faraday rotation reading the energy necessary for writing a bit and the signal efficiency of the read process are regarded theoretically. It is shown that it is not sufficient to characterize the magnetooptical properties by the ratio F/α of the specific Faraday rotation F and the absorption coefficient α. F - α combinations in a limited region of the F - α plane are required instead. Based on these considerations, the requirements concerning the properties of magnetooptic storage films are evaluated and compared in detail with the properties observed experimentally for MnBi and Mn0.8Ti0.2Bi films. Mn0.8Ti0.2Bi films with the high-temperature phase sufficiently stable from room temperature up to well above the Curie temperature are of especial interest for magnetooptic memories."
"MnBi thin films were prepared by successive deposition of a Bi layer and then a Mn layer onto a glass substrate, followed by an anneal up to 300°C. In order to investigate the details of formation of MnBi films, the samples were quenched from various annealing temperatures and examined by α-ray backscattering and X-ray diffraction. It was found that Mn atoms leaving Mn crystals migrate very fast in the well-oriented Bi layer to form well-oriented MnBi crystals at the expense of Bi crystals."
"Thermomagnetic writing on MnBi films was studied by dynamic observation on a change in a magnetization state using a two-beam method. As a writing laser beam increased in pulse duration, four writing characteristics were successively observed: I) nonwritable, II) writable without the first order phase transition, III) writable with the transition, and IV) decomposed. Observation of a nonmagnetic state in a writing cycle in II) revealed that the thermomagnetic writing is the extrapolated Curie point writing. The domain expansion phenomena observed in a writing cycle in II) are discussed based on a domain theory."
"The annealing behavior of hard magnetic films of the Co-M system (M = Ni, P) was followed using differential thermal analysis. These studies showed that the thermal behavior of electrodeposited Co, Co-P, Co-Ni, and Co-Ni-P films is different from that of chemically deposited Co-P films. The most pronounced reaction was found to be exothermic and occurred between 200°C and 300°C. After thermally stabilizing these films at 500°C for 1 hour in a vacuum, the temperature dependence of Hc was found to depend on additive content and crystallite orientation. Films with low additive contents and hcp(100) orientation were found to have the highest sensitivity of He to temperature."
"In order to investigate the head saturation which is observed in the recording process using a recording media with a high coercivity exceeding 500 Oe, the magnetic field distribution around the gap in the saturated condition is investigated using a large scale ferrite model head. The gap field gradually saturates by increasing the ampere-turns applied to the coil. When the flux density in the gap approaches the saturation flux density of the core material, the shape of the field distribution around the gap changes from semicircles, in the saturated condition, to arcs. Therefore, as the gap field in the saturated range increases, the rate of decrease, in the longitudinal direction of the recording field becomes more gradual. These phenomena will cause the effects similar to the head-tape spacing and expansion of the gap length in the recording process."
"Co-P thin film is promising as a high density recording medium. It has been used in magnetic drums and disks, but no report has been published on its use for a conventional VTR. Therefore, we have been studying its possible application to video tape. This paper introduces our experimental plated Co-P tape for a conventional home VTR. For additional details, see Digests of the 1972 Intermag Conference (available from IEEE Headquarters)."
"The pseudobinary solid solutions of Y2+x(Co1-yFey)17-2xintermetallic compounds with the hexagonal Th2Ni17type structure have been investigated in relation to their magnetocrystalline anisotropy. It was found from X-ray diffraction measurements on magnetically oriented powder samples that the sign of the anisotropy constant of the compounds changes at certain values ofxandy. It is noted that in the compounds with small Fe content (y\\approx0) their stoichiometric character (x) plays an important role in determining the sign of the anisotropy constant."
"In Co5Sm, the coercive force of aggregates of powders or sintered magnets is much greater at 77 K than at room temperature. In single particles, the field at which an individual magnetization jump occurs increases rapidly and monotonically with decreasing T. On the other hand, the K reported for Co5Sm is the same at 77 K and room T, with a broad maximum between. It thus appears that the reversal process is not controlled by the properties of bulk Co5Sm. The observed T dependence must be ascribable to the imperfections that govern the magnetization reversal process."
"The interaction between bubble domains and areas of deliberately introduced material damage is described. The damaged regions, of controlled extent and precise location, were introduced by exposing the material to a beam of electrons typically 8 micrometers in diameter. Using either samarium-terbium orthoferrite or epitaxial garnet, no domain interaction was apparent until the beam energy density was sufficient to cause visible surface damage to the specimen. In the latter case, the interaction between the damaged region and the domain wall was found to be of a repulsive nature, in contrast to the usual attractive interaction with naturally occurring defects. By producing continuous damage extending around the outline of a rectangle a large number of domains were constrained within the rectangle. Their symmetrical spacing from the lines of damage confirmed the repulsive nature of the interaction. The specimen temperature rise during exposure is calculated and possible mechanisms for the domain behavior considered. Some practical device applications using the damage technique are described. For instance, the motion of bubbles might be constrained to specific propagation channels, or the interaction used to perform logic functions."
"Cobaloy is an alloy particle consisting mainly of cobalt coprecipitated with nickel and iron as the oxalate. Careful pyrolytic reduction permits control of coercive force from 600 to 1200 Oe within ±50 Oe. Cobaloy particles are about 0.05 micron long with a length-to-diameter ratio of 2 or 3 to 1. Controlled oxidation of the particle surfaces to about 10% of particle weight markedly reduces pyrophoricity and increases resistance to oxidation. Tape made from Cobaloy particles shows improved high-frequency response resulting from higher coercive force and increased remanence."
"The write field surrounding a miniaturized recording head of the finite pole-tip configuration is calculated by an iterative method. The problem is assumed two dimensional with uniaxially anisotropic material. The exchange field is neglected. The effects of core and conductor dimensions, material characteristics, and drive current are examined."
"The preparation of submicroscopic chained cobalt and cobalt alloy particles by spontaneous autocatalytic reduction in protein solution has been studied. By varying the kind of protein, the average particle size can be easily varied from approximately 100 Å to 500 Å. The effects of the bath pH and hypophosphite content on the magnetic properties of the particles obtained are measured. It has been found that the coercive force can be increased at pH values from 8.0 to 8.5. However, coercive forces ranging from 300 Oe to 1000 Oe can be obtained by controlling the concentration of sodium hypophosphite. The rotational hysteresis integrals for the cobalt particles studied were in the range 1.2 to 1.8. These values are indicative of a single-domain chain of spheres model involving incoherent reversal."
"Magnetic particles suitable for recording media are prepared by dissolving a metal salt (nickel, cobalt, iron, or their mixtures) in dimethyl sulfoxide to form a metal complex which is reacted with the phthalate ion (also dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) to produce the metal phthalate which precipitates with addition of water. The supernatant liquid is decanted, leaving the precipitate, which is washed with an aqueous solution to remove residual dimethyl sulfoxide. Reduction of the dried precipitate in the presence of hydrogen forms magnetic particles, cubic in structure, and of a particle size averaging between 0.03 and 1.5 microns."
"This paper investigated the coercive force (Hc) of laminated Co-P films. The films were laminated by introducing intermediate layers of Pd (T \\sim 25Å) or nonmagnetic Ni-P (T = 250 Å) between the Co-P films. The thickness of the Co-P films was varied from 650 Å to 2600 Å but was maintained constant within any series of laminations. The Hcwas evaluated as a function of total thickness for multiple Co-P laminate thicknesses up to 10,000 Å. The Hcof laminated Co-P films with intermediate Pd layers increased with total lamination thickness regardless of the thickness of the individual Co-P film. However, Co-P laminates deposited from a dilute solution with intermediate layers of Ni-P exhibited Hcvalues independent of the total lamination thickness. The Hcwas independent of the total lamination thickness regardless of the base material provided Ni-P was deposited as the substrate. The magnitude of the Hcwas dependent on the Co-P film thickness. The Hcof such Co-P laminates can be adjusted from 340 Oe to 700 Oe by selection of the appropriate thickness of the Co-P film. Co-P laminates deposited from a concentrated solution with intermediate layers of Ni-P exhibit Hcvalues which decrease with total lamination thickness. These films exhibited lower Hcvalues than nonlaminated Co-P films."
"An analysis is made of the recording fields for heads whose permeability is a nonlinear function of flux density. Poisson's and Laplace's equations of a vector magnetic potential are solved by a successive overrelaxation method. The magnetic saturation of the head core at a large field and the effect of permeability at a small field are analyzed."
"This paper describes a ring shape Permalloy magnetoresistive detector for magnetic bubble domains. The advantages over a rectangular detector are a large increase in signal, low noise generated by a rotating field, and no critical limitation of detector location. The optimal design of the ring Permalloy detector was obtained from the calculated distributions of bubble domain stray fields. Typical geometry of the detector is as follows: Permalloy film thickness = 300 Å, width of sensor = 15 μm, and inner diameter of the ring = 100 μm. The resistance of the detector is 600 Ω. This detector yielded 12 mV output signals for a 100μm diameter bubble domain when the rotating in-plane field was 22 Oe and the input current was 5.5 mA."
"Magnetic bubble domains in epitaxially-grown magnetic garnet have been detected by the Hall effect of indium antimonide evaporated films. Several structures of propagating and detecting devices are compared. A propagating and detecting device stacked on a single substrate was fabricated. Devices having T-bar circuits with an 80- and a 40-μm period were tested for 15- and 10-μm bubbles, respectively; signal voltages of 1.2- and 1.4-mV peak were obtained, respectively. Noise voltage due to an interaction between propagating and detecting elements was observed, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 8-dB was obtained without cancelation of the noise voltage."
"A new principle of a functional arrayed detector for bubble domains employing multiple three-terminal Hall elements is reported with experimental results. Theories are developed, on the fundamental characteristics and requirements for the detector are discussed. When two three-terminal Hall elements are connected in parallel, an output voltage appears only when a bubble domain is present at either of the two elements, and thus an Exclusive OR operation of bubble domain logic can be performed in the process of detection. Various types of one- and two-dimensional arrayed detectors up to 100 bits were made on this principle with both InSb single crystal and vacuum deposited thin film of InSb. Maximum sensitivities of 20 and 15 mV/mA kG were obtained, giving output voltages of 2 and 3 mV for bubble domains in YFeO3at a bias field of 20 Oe, with vacuum deposited film and single crystal InSb detectors, respectively, with an excellent S/N ratio. Exclusive OR operation was confirmed in the performances. Applicability to the small domains in garnet is also discussed."
"Torque measurements have been made on single crystals of Ni, Dy, and Tb from 4.2 to 300 K using the high-field Bitter magnets of the University of Pennsylvania. For measurements up to 70 kOe, we used a 125-mm-bore radial access magnet fitted with iron pole pieces. For higher fields (up to 145 kOe), we used a 26-mm-bore axial access magnet, with the sample mounted on one of a pair of nylon bevel gears so the torque could be transmitted to an axial rod. In both cases, the torque was measured through a fixed lever arm and a pair of force transducers using unbonded resistance strain gages. The gages were excited at 4 kHz and the unbalance measured with a lock-in amplifier. Data on a"
"This paper presents some new results on orthoferrite magnetic properties. We have measured the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization for neodim, samarium, and thulium orthoferrites having compensation temperatures. The measurement of the magnetic permeabilities near these temperatures makes it possible to find the effective fields of exchange interactions between the iron and rare earth ions and to prove that these interactions have strong anisotropy. For example, the exchange interactions for TuFeO3have opposite signs along theaandcaxes, so that the spin reorientation results in the change of the orthoferrite spontaneous magnetization. The different mechanisms of the anisotropy of the iron and rare earth ion exchange interactions are discussed."
"The spin reorientation temperature (Tr) has been measured on Co and Co-Ti substituted YFeO3single crystals grown by the floating zone method. For YFe1-xCoxO3with an x of up to 0.02, no spin reorientation has been observed above 77 K. On the contrary, Trdepended strongly on small x for YFe1-xCox/2Tix/2O3. The magnetic anisotropy of YFeO3was found to be markedly influenced by Co2+, whose contribution was accounted for by the single ion model, having one ion anisotropy energy of approximately 65 cm-1/ion."
"The microwave losses in polycrystalline ferrites can be separated into two parts: those associated with resonance (inhomogeneous linebroadening and two magnon processes) and intrinsic losses. In recent years, both types have been studied in great detail. The near-resonance relaxation can be quantitatively explained by anisotropy and/or porosity scattering if the secondary scattering among spin-waves and spin-wave relaxation are taken into account. The off-resonance relaxation is found to be quite sensitive to the polycrystal microstructure. Several mechanisms, including transit time limited relaxation and magnetostrictive phonon scattering, appear to be important, but the understanding of the basic loss processes is far from complete."
"One of the authors has demonstrated that the high-power capability of a latching phase shifter was remarkably enhanced by employing Co2+doped Gd YIG without any increase in the insertion loss. Investigations done so far on the insertion loss are not sufficient to describe this fact. A part of the results of the investigation concerning Co2+doped Gd YIG has been presented by Nicolas et al. The characteristics of the Co2+, doped Gd YIG have been studied in regard to a latching phase shifter by way of the precise measurement of the complex permeabilities. For the samples containing an appropriate amount of Co2+, the part of the insertion loss due to the anisotropy field has been proved to be eliminated, and the value of the spin-wave linewidth has suggested that high-power capability is enhanced. The coercive force indicates the minimum value at that content of Co2+, while the remanence ratio remains fairly constant. It is concluded that the materials containing an appropriate amount of Co2+are superior to those materials without Co2+in both the insertion loss and high-power capability."
"Néel temperature and ferrimagnetic resonance linewidth measurements were carried out in the composition Y3-2x-yCa2x+yFe5-x-yMyVxO12, where M=Zr or Ti. It was revealed, that both of the Zr and Ti substitutions in this system reduced the value of K1/Mseffectively, and this led to the remarkable linewidth reduction. The lowest value of linewidth obtained was 1.8 Oe at the composition of x=0.4 and y=0.4 for M=Zr."
"The authors have developed prostheses and methods whereby energy stored in magnetic fields and/or thermal energy can be utilized to restore function to organs which depend on movement of smooth, skeletal, or cardiac muscle, and whose function has failed because of failure of muscle movement. Such organs include the bladder, urinary sphincter, colostomy or ileostomy stoma, and levator palpebrae of the lid and heart. For additional details see Digests of the 1972 Intermag Conference (available from IEEE Headquarters)."
"Composite formation of a magnetic ferrite with nonmagnetic oxides provide a useful application for microwave integrated systems. Holst and Lemke [1] and Paladino and Snider [2] have prepared ferrite-dielectric oxide composites by conventional sintering and hot-pressing, respectively. We examined the joining of NiZn ferrite with ilmenite type titanates, FeTiO3, CoTiO3, and NiTiO3by a hot-pressing technique [3]. Under a hot-pressing condition of 1200°C, 200 kg/cm2for air 2 h, a combination of the ferrite and NiTiO3was successful in joining without any cracks, but the other combinations of the ferrite with FeTiO3and CoTiO3were destructive at the interfacial boundaries. For photomicrographs and additional details, see Digests of the 1972 Intermag Conference (available from IEEE Headquarters)."
"A series of tests of ferrites serving as the contrast materials for the X-ray diagnosis of the digestive organs were carried out. Tests as conducted covered the solubility of ferrites in both the artificial gastric juice and the intestinal juice, the toxicity, the X-ray absorption, and the magnetic field strength required for controlling the ferrite powders, as well as the applicability to actual diagnosis. Magnanese zinc ferrite powders sintered at temperatures as high as 1200°C or more were verified to exhibit performance good enough to be applied to the practical X-ray diagnosis of the digestive organs as the contrast material. It was also found that those mangnese zinc ferrites which contain oxides of such materials as Ba, W, or Ce in 5 through 10 weight percents possess the X-ray absorption rates nearly equal to those of barium sulfates. The experimental tests on animals indicated that ferrite powders will be available for the X-ray diagnosis of the bronchus, the liver, the pancreas, and the small vessels."
"Since biological tissues have about 70 or 80% water, the water structure in tissue may be attributed to tissue water. The relaxation time using NMR in cancerous tissue was investigated in various experimental tumors. It was established that for solid tumors in MH134-C3H/He and leukemic mice, the relaxation time (T1and T2) measured by NMR was higher than that of other tissues except brain and lymph node. Moreover, in induced hepatoma and regenerating liver, the value of T2increases in accordance with the malignancy of tumor growth. In another experiment, it was found that protoporphyrin, which has anticancer action without destroying cancer cells at least in vitro, inhibits the increase of T1and T2in solid tumors (MH134-C3H/He) when administered intra-tumor every day. The increase of relaxation time using NMR is considered not only as the increase of motional freedom, but also as the decrease of ordering of tissue water, which has a close connection with disdifferentiation of tissue. Although the clinical application of relaxation time using NMR for differential diagnosis of cancer requires further study, these experimental results suggest that the prolongation of relaxation time may indicate the malignancy of neoplastic growth."
"A new type of magnetic bubble circuit called YY overlay permits a fabrication of relatively higher density and is useful for the design of a logic element because of its simple configuration. A bias modulation switch, crossover, and some simple logic elements using the YY overlay have been investigated. The switch is simpler to fabricate and operate than a conductor switch or a switch by reversing a rotating field. A 364 bit repertory dialer memory was designed and tested. Sufficient operating margins of propagation, generation, and switching have been obtained."
"This paper described an NDRO rewritable high speed random access memory which is operated with a 2.5D mode at the write cycle, with a unit capacity of 4096 words of 144 bit length. This memory, with a very high speed of 250 ns read cycle, 750 ns split write cycle, was attainded by permeability sensing with novel ferrite material. This new electronically alterable NDRO core memory, having a low power consumption of 0.02 mW/bit at the read cycle and 0.2 mW/bit at the write cycle, with high data transfer rate of 5 × 108bits/s, was developed."
"A method for computer-aided design (CAD) of switching core driven memory systems is reported in this paper. The design criterion is based on the resetting operation for the flux in a switching core. The relations between this criterion and the driving current value, the duration of driving pulse current, and the load variation depending on memory information pattern are quantitatively investigated. In addition, a method for calculating the maximum driving capacity based on the linear equivalent circuit has been developed. Based on these results of investigation, a CAD system for calculating the operating margin, operating speed (the cycle time), and storage capacity has been achieved. This CAD system can be widely utilized for designing highly reliable core memories, twistor type ROM, etc."
"There is ample evidence that further advancement in the state of the art of digital magnetic recording systems hinges to a large extent on the limitations imposed by the writing process, and in particular on the phenomena of recording demagnetization and asymmetric peak shift. To adequately handle these problems one must consider the dynamic interaction of the writing-demagnetization process self-consistently and integrally, instead of treating these processes as independent and unrelated. The evolution of our theoretical understanding of saturation recording is discussed, with particular emphasis on the iterative process which offers the greatest promise for the adequate treatment of the nonlinear writing-demagnetization phenomena. The results of the theoretical analysis are used to predict the desired properties of the recording materials for high bit packing densities, where recording demagnetizing is severely limiting system performance. Besides the well-known criteria of small thickness and relatively low remanence and high coercivity, a very narrow range of switching fields (steep-sided hysteresis loop) is also very desirable. In this regard the recent development of a superior gamma-ferric oxide coating is most exciting. It consists of nondendritic particles which can be well dispersed and aligned resulting in phenomenal orientation ratios, narrow range of switching fields, and superior recording performance."
"The anhysteretic contact printing process is analyzed theoretically and the printing properties are presented in terms of the basic parameters of the printing system. The effect of \"imaging\" of the master and the slave magnetization due to a high permeability transfer head is taken into account. The transfer efficiency has \"imaging loss,\" especially at long wavelengths due to this effect. Conditions which reduce this imaging loss are discussed. Good agreement between the theoretical calculations and the experimental results was obtained. It is shown that the perpendicular component of the slave magnetization cannot be ignored at short wavelengths even for the longitudinally particle-oriented slave tapes, as pointed out by Tjaden et al."
"There are two major approaches to high-density recording on magnetic tape. One is to shorten the wavelength of the signal to be recorded on the medium, and the other is to reduce the track width on which the signal is to be recorded. Our findings indicate that the most proper approach to increase recording density is to narrow the track width while maintaining as much as possible a condition whereby the tape will be the main source of noise. Even then, we are confronted with several limiting factors in producing practical equipment: the problem of correct tracing of the tape over the narrow track of the reproducing head; an increase in dropout and level fluctuation; and an increase in crosstalk between tracks and heads."
"The polycrystalline films of NiFe2O4, YIG, BaFe12O19, Ba2Zn2Fe12O22, or Ba3Co2Fe2O4were deposited on the Al2O3substrate by using the arc-plasma jet of an oxidizing gas of 90% oxygen gas and 10% argon gas. It has been found that those ferrite films which were prepared by this procedure possess saturation magnetizations less than and magnetic half-linewidths, ΔH, at 9 GHz, broader than those of the sintered ferrites. It has also been found that the properties of these films are highly sensitive to the partial pressure of the oxygen contained in the jet. Preparations of ferrite films with crystal orientation as well as films with induced anisotropy were also carried out."
"A means of assessing the relative merits of single-ended and push-pull switching converter or inverter stages is presented. The dependency of those merits upon the range of input voltage and output current is set forth. For a single-ended high-frequency converter stage, the relationships among output power, switch current and voltage ratings, input voltage range, and reset voltage reveal the criticality of transformer design. Transformer stored energy considerations for optimum output power dictate absolute control of leakage reactance as well as the shape of the magnetization curve."
"A new type of ferrite antenna with fairly high sensitivity has been studied and experimental results are presented. Although ferrite antennas have long been used as one of the typical antennas of small size, it seems that the remarkable increase of the sensitivity of the ferrite antennas depends upon dimensions and performance of ferrite material, and improvement of those factors is not expected so easily at the present state of the art. One solution for this problem may be the application of the integration technique, that is combining an antenna and active devices in a unified structure with an inseparable form. To form an active device within an antenna, parametric excitation is incorporated into a ferrite antenna structure, and the principle of power transfer between signals, which follows Manley-Rowe's relation, is applied to it for obtaining an active gain within the antenna itself. The permeability variation of the ferrite material is effectively utilized to produce an active function from a passive antenna system. Results show about 5 to 10 dB gain depending upon the pumping power interims of S/N over the conventional passive ferrite antenna having the same size as that of the active antenna."
"The construction details and the operation mechanism of a thermomagnetic motor made of temperature sensitive magnetic material are described in this paper. Because of the lack of a temperature sensitive magnetic material having suitable characteristics, the output and the efficiency of this motor are of extremely low value. As a results of these considerations and experiments the authors find it is not only useful for the development of energy conversion in electrical engineering to clarify the mechanism of such an energy converter, but also suggestive and serviceable to the development of new control devices."
"The magnetostatic field distribution associated with Permalloy circuits for bubble domain propagation is analyzed by the Fourier series method. The analysis is three-dimensional in geometry with two-dimensional variation in magnetization vector. It is found that both the normal component magnetostatic field and its average value are linearly proportional to the in-plane field, unless the magnetization is saturated. The fields decay exponentially from the surface of Permalloy circuits and are highly nonuniformly distributed along the circuits, resulting in nonlinear bubble speed. The calculated results are in good agreement with field measurements obtained from a scale-up model."
"Garnet epitaxial wafers are now available [1,2] which permit data to be stored at densities greater than one million bits per square inch (>200 000/cm2) and which allow data to be shifted at rates greater than one megahertz. We are developing circuits to fully utilize these materials which will be directly compatible with integrated-circuit peripherial electronics. They contain a number of independent storage loops, typically 512 bits, which are randomly accessible. Data is read by propagating the domain stream past a magnetoresistance domain detector element when the peripheral electronics applies a series of bipolar pulses (typically 2 volts and 8 mA) to the single-conductor propagation circuit of the loop to be read. The propagation circuit consists of a pattern of serrated-edge grooves etched into the epitaxial garnet layer [3,4] and overlapped with a serpentine conductor [5]. Information has been coded onto a complete stream of domains (one per bit) by using the lateral displacement technique [6]. Memory chips of the type described here are easily designed into small or large systems since the only external mechanical requirements are a constant magnetic bias field (supplied by a permanent magnet) and a reasonable amount of shielding from stray magnetic fields."
"Theoretical results are presented for the magneto-optical effects encountered by a 1.15 μm laser light crossing a YIG bar where spinwaves are magnetically excited. Experimental results are reported for the optical probing of magnetostatic waves, exchange spinwaves, and magnetoelastic waves. The main results obtained are a qualitative verification of the polarization influence on the interaction intensity and measurements of the propagation losses and the focusing effect of the spinwave beam."
"The coupled magnetoelastic equations for a YIG film have been solved for the longitudinal and transverse power transmitted to a substrate. The maximum power transmission efficiency occurs when both the magnetic and elastic systems are in resonance, and for thicknesses corresponding to 9 (L) and 15 (T) half-wavelengths."
"The magnetic circuit of the head consists of two identical laminations each carrying alternate \"C\" and \"L\" shapes attached to a common selvedge. The read and write gaps are formed by the juxtaposition of the upper limbs of the \"L\" elements with the \"C\" elements, a shim of suitable thickness being inserted between them. The circuit is completed by welding the lower limbs of the \"L\"s to the \"C\"s, after a prewound coil has been slid over each \"C\" element. The pair of laminations are sandwiched between housings and the selvedge is ground off, separating the elements of each track. Heads have shown excellent read and write characteristics in the standard 9-track, 1/2 inch tape format at 1600 bits/inch, phase-encoded, at speeds up to 25 inches/s. At higher frequencies, the eddy-current losses in the magnetic circuit cause the performance to deteriorate."
"The epitaxial growth of thin EuS films by vacuum deposition on a variety of ionic single-crystal substrates has been investigated. The structure and the epitaxy were determined by a sensitive Seemann-Bohlin diffractometer. Good epitaxial growth is obtained on the cleavage plane of mica and on the"
"A complex study of magnetization change, optical Faraday effect, and light absorption spectrum has been carried out on uniaxial antiferromagnetic crystals of MnF2of FeCO3under the phase transitions induced by strong external magnetic field. The measurements were made at 4.2 and 20.4 K, which is lower than Néel temperature (Tn=68 and 38 K for MnF2and FeCO3, respectively). The field used was pulsed up to 400 kOe. MnF2: The magnetic properties have been studied in detail employing a pickup coil method in a narrow range of magnetic fields near the spin-flopping field (Hc=92 kOe) with a strict field orientation along the tetragonal axis of the crystal symmetry. The angular field deviation ψ from the c4axis is controlled to within 1.5'. In the narrow range of angles ψ < 30', the differential magnetic susceptibility near the spin-flopping field Hcdepends on the sample form and the magnetization process is of a jump-like character. The measurements of the longitudinal (along the magnetic field) and transversal susceptibility components made using three pickup coils of mutually perpendicular axes and three coaxial coils shifted along the sample axis show that at ψ < 30' and H=Hc± 200 Oe the sample magnetically cleaves into interchanging layers of 10-5cm3volume which stretch along the symmetry axis of the sample and differ from each other by a longitudinal component of the magnetization vector."
"The reversible flux increment in two-core self-saturating amplifiers creates the possibility of partial reset without any control voltage. In this paper experimental results are presented for a range of control circuit resistance and for sinusoidal and square-wave excitation."
"A previously proposed switching model of ferrite cores under voltage pulsed excitations was based on the assumption that the flux switching occurs along the static magnetizing curve, independent of pulse amplitude. To define the limit of applicability of this model, the flux switching properties of ferrites under quasi-voltage pulsed excitations are investigated in terms of the switching φ(F) curve. The bounds of the voltage pulsed excitation are determined by two indications, composed of circuit parameters and the pulse amplitude. Domain patterns in the core driven by the quasi-voltage pulses are discussed briefly with regard to the relation between the complete flux switching and the partial switching."
"It is shown that the reversal time versus excess applied field curve of a square-loop core is equivalent to the relationship between eddy current loss per cycle and frequency at Bm= Bs. The theoretical expressions for eddy current loss are introduced on the basis of the equations of domain wall motion and the relation of the number of domain walls to the applied field intensity which were obtained in connection with studies of the mechanism of magnetization reversal. Predicted values based on these expressions for 50% Ni-Fe tape core agree well with the observed losses at a frequency range in excess of 30 Hz."
"Detailed stroboscopic observation of magnetic bubbles has been performed on Permalloy overlay circuits, such as T bar and Y bar utilizing YFeO3, TbFeO3, and ErFeO3platelets, and the results have been analyzed on the basis of bubble domain dynamics. A new anomalous bubble propagation mode, recently derived theoretically, has been verified semiquantitatively by experiment. In the anomalous mode, a bubble tends to propagate back and forth along the Permalloy overlay, resulting in a mean forward velocity smaller than the normal velocity determined by the drive frequency. Two different methods, which determine the ratio between the effective bubble driving field intrinsic to an unsaturated Permalloy overlay configuration and the external driving field, have been proposed and the ratios for various configurations have been measured. The typical values are 0.3 for T bar, 0.5 for Y bar, 0.6 for two-sided bars, and nearly 1.0 for two-sided T bars in the orthoferrites with about 10 μm spacing between Permalloy overlays and platelets. The two-sided T bar circuit makes it possible to drive TbFeO3up to 380 kHz."
"The stability of operation of bubble domains along T-Bar circuits depends on the interaction between the bubble domains and Permalloy patterns. As the thickness of the Permalloy pattern is increased, the trapped bubble on the Permalloy pattern becomes larger and the collapse field becomes higher than that of a free bubble."
"Numerical methods are used to calculate the fields for magnetic recording heads made from nonlinear magnetic materials. The nonlinear model used in the study fits ferrite magnetization curves well and requires little computer time for evaluation. Results show that as the head drive fields are increased, the resolution of the head deteriorates."
"A theoretical analysis has been made of the dynamic behavior of bubble domains when they undergo changes in size or shape. The result of the analysis shows that the changes are characterized by relaxation constants depending primarily on bubble radius, wall mobility, and saturation magnetization. As expected, the perturbations to the domain radius or domain shape are linearly dependent on the magnitude of the various field perturbations and are double valued depending upon whether the field perturbations are increasing or decreasing."
"The use of electron spin-echo decay as a means of sensing the magnetic environment of a paramagnetic ion is suggested by the sensitivity of echo decay to small changes in the magnetic environment. Echo decay in hydrated and deuterated lanthanum magnesium double nitrate (LMN) doped with Mn2+or Cu2+was either Lorantzian (\\alphae^{-m\\tau^{2}}) or Gaussian (\\alphae^{-2k\\tau^{3}/3, where τ is the two pulse separation)."
"Previous theories of the kinetic aspects of domain wall motion were based on one-dimensional solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz equation. Our recently derived [1,2] equations of motion for a curved wall in three-dimensional space are particularly applicable to bubble Films. We found [3,4] that the stray magnetic field emanating from divergence at the film surfaces destabilizes uniform motion of the domain wall at a critical velocity Vpmuch smaller than Walker's limit."
"Hot-pressing of a Ni1/3Fe2/3coprecipitate at 300°C, 12 kbar resulted in the formation of a high density pellet of very fine-grained nickel ferrite, of which the crystallite size was 170 Å. The static magnetic properties were found to be very different from those of ordinary nickel ferrite. The magnetization under high magnetic field was much lower in value and was too hard to be readily saturated. In contrast, the Mössbauer spectra were not much different from those of ordinary ferrite. By annealing, the specimen first showed rather an unexpected enhancement in magnetic hardness and then gradually approached that of ordinary ferrite. A tentative model based on an assumption of strong interaction between the crystallites is discussed."
"The readout signal and noise generation processes have been studied for a magnetooptical data storage model using a GaAs laser source for both thermal writing and Faraday readout on a Fe doped EuO film. Experience with a laboratory model indicates that the usual analysis which treats only detector shot noise leads to incorrect values for optimum film thickness and analyzer angle. For additional details, see Digests of the 1972 Intermag Conference (available from IEEE Headquarters)."
"The use of large superconducting inductors for \"pumped\" energy storage as an alternate to pumped hydro-storage is discussed. It is suggested that large units might be developed at less than $200/kW and with losses less than the 50 percent representative of pumped hydrostorage. Particular notice is taken of the ability of such peaking units to damp overall power system electromechanical oscillations. Attention is also given to the stress considerations in magnet windings and to the optimization of superconductor and structural material. A preliminary analysis is made for a 400 MW-10 000 MWh unit."
"The effects of the preparation conditions, such as basic composition, kinds and amounts of additives, and sintering atmospheres on the magnetic characteristics of Mn-Zn ferrite were studied. From the results a quantitative relation among these preparation conditions was found. Using this relation optimum preparation conditions for a given ferrite composition can be estimated."
"Low temperature heat treatment was studied for preparing low loss and high stability MnZn ferrites. A prototype channel filter available for high packing density (e.g., 600 channels/bay) was made using MnZn ferrite cores. Difficulties in continuing the miniaturization of the L-C channel filter are discussed. Advantages of mechanical filters are explained in view of miniaturization. Piezoelectric materials were developed as transducer materials for mechanical filters and will be gradually used to supersede ferrites."
"This paper describes a very sensitive detector for bubble domains using Permalloy magnetoresistive effect. In the conventional operation method of planar magnetoresistive elements they are arranged close to the circumference of a bubble domain, where the magnetic field runs parallel to the plane of elements. But even if the magnetic field is applied to the direction of the angle φ against the film plane, the value of magnetoresistance change ratio ΔR/R is, except near φ= π/2, similar to the one magnetized to the direction of the film plane, namely, φ = 0. This experiment is explained from the fact that the specimen is magnetized by the horizontal component of the applied field. Considering the magnetic field out of a bubble domain, this result refers that the detector is arranged not only at the circumference of domain but also above the surface and the outside of it. Then the detector of type is designed; its length is a, and its width and gap are a/6, where a is a bubble diameter. The sensing voltage of 15 mV can be obtained from a bubble domain of TmFeO3at driving current 7 mA, which is four or five times those of detection voltage published in the past."
"Ferromagnetic resonance techniques have been used to evaluate the magnetic parameters in thin films of YIG type materials. YIG disk films having thickness from 0.39 μm to 1.15 μm and diameters from 250 μm to 1000 μm and grown by CVD on GGG substrates where investigated from 1.fK to 300 K and at 10 GHz and 25 GHz. The magnetization, obtained from parallel and perpendicular resonance data, is in agreement with bulk values in the temperature range 300 K to 80 K. Below 80 K the magnetization deviates dramatically from bulk values and by 4 K the magnetization is decreasing by 30 Oe/K. The linewidth at 10 GHz is observed to be about 0.40 Oe from 300 K to 200 K then increases to a maximum of 2.00 Oe at 50 K. At 2 K the linewidth has decreased to about 0.50 Oe. The g value, being 2.006 at 300 K follows bulk values to 80 K. Below 80 K the g value increases dramatically, reaching 2.02 by 20 K. The in-plane anisotropy, cubic term, was measured and found to be in agreement with bulk values at all temperatures. A spinwave exchange constant of 3.4 × 10-12cm2was observed at room temperature for films having pinned surface spins. This value has decreased by about 15 percent at 80 K and remains nearly constant from 80 K to 20 K. From analysis of the magnetoexchange modes, a repulsion between magnetoexchange branches was observed for films having pinned surface spins and no repulsion for unpinned surface spins. An exchange dominated surface mode has also been observed."
"We have determined the magnetic phase diagram and the antiferromagnetic structure in the Co-Mn-Fe system. The condition for Invar effect was examined in the ferromagnetic state, and the antiferromagnetism due to band gap was confirmed. A universal relation between Néel points and lattice parameters was proposed."
"A review is given of recent advances which have been made in the area of magnetic bubble domain devices with emphasis being placed on new device components and the problem of device optimization. The subject of bubble domain propagation is introduced by considering the results obtained on the basis of a simplified model which is applied to individual bars and bar pairs to illustrate the basic principles involved in field access drive circuits. Experimental data is presented which qualitatively confirms various aspects of the model. New device component designs are then introduced, such as the multiple-bar keyhole generator and the chevron stretcher detector, in which bubble stretching occurs orthogonal to bubble motion. Preliminary data on these as well as on various other circuit components are presented and discussed in the light of future device applications."
"Using 52 μm thick TmFeO3orthoferrite plate and 1.2 μm thick permalloy film, we realized a two-dimensional shift array of magnetic bubbles on which any two-dimensional pattern can be shifted in a horizontal or vertical direction. This functional array utilizing the shift nature and array processable characteristics of magnetic bubbles suggests the possibility of functional devices for pattern processing. As an example of these functional devices, we propose the pattern rotating memory which can be applied to preprocessing in pattern recognition. We verified the feasibility of this idea by means of computer simulation."
"Bubble-to-bubble logic operations can greatly enhance the versatility of bubble memory devices. Our experience to date, however, has shown us that logic operations reduce the device operating margins to a degree that would allow logic only where the ratio of memory sites to logic gates is greater than one hundred. For example, quasistatic rotating field operation of exclusive OR, AND/OR, and replicate gates was obtained for a ± 3.5 percent bias margin at 45 to 55 Oe rotating field drive for an AND/OR gate to a ± 1.5 percent bias field margin at 50 to 60 Oe rotating field drive for an exclusive OR gate. In all cases these devices were prepared by ion milling or chemical etching T-bar, Y-bar, or chevron patterns in 3000 to 5000 Å thick Permalloy films on glass. The pattern feature sizes ranged from 3 to 7.5 μm. The Permalloy on glass patterns were placed on epitaxially grown magnetic garnet wafers with bubble diameters ranging from 8 to 17 μm. Circuit operation was determined by visual observation. In all cases, the results are from either the first design of the circuits or the first iteration design."
"All the Invar alloys now in practical application are ferromagnetic Fe-base alloys of the fcc structure, but the ferromagnetism of these alloys is often liable to limit the scope of their application. Very recently, the present authors discovered that antiferromagnetic Cr-Fe-Mn ternary solid solution alloys of the bcc structure possess Invar characteristics over a wide temperature range centered around room temperature, and furthermore, that the alloys are practically free from any magnetic effect. It became clear that these alloys show Elinvar characteristics in the Invar temperature range. Similar results have been obtained on a number of other Cr-based ternary solid solution alloys of the bcc structure."
"Chromium dioxide modified with sulfur has been studied with the intention of obtaining a magnetic powder which is suitable for the tape of thermomagnetic duplication. Sulfur ions dissolve into CrO2up to about 0.17 wt.% and decrease the Curie temperature and saturation magnetization. With added sulfur of about 1 wt.%, the Tc of chromium dioxide is lowered by 20°C and the σsbecomes about 70 EMU/g. The lattice parameter a0increases with increasing sulfur, while c0shows no change. The CrO2with only a sulfur modifier does not have fine acicular shape. Therefore, the combined addition of S and Te was tried. The S-Te-modified CrO2has Tcof 100°C, Hcof 400 Oe and σsof 81 EMU/g. The particle shape of this oxide is about 0.5 μm in average length and 10/1 in length to width ratio. This powder has high potential for use in the magnetic tape of thermal duplication."
"A new plated-wire memory plane has been developed. The plated wire has 50-μm diameter and 6000-Å multi-layered magnetic film. The memory plane has the snap-in structure with permalloy side-keepers. The word line spacing is 0.8 mm and the sense-digit line spacing is 0.5 mm. Using this plane, a plated-wire mainframe memory has been designed for commercial use. It has a 64-kbyte capacity, a 300-ns access time and a 600-ns cycle time, and it is characterized by improved 1 cross-point/bit sense-digit organization. The well-defined parameters of the planes enable memory systems to be designed with improved cost performance."
"The magnetic and optical properties of thin films prepared by chemical vapor deposition in the system (1-x)Fe3O4.xFe8/3O4are a strong function of x. In particular, the coercive field increases significantly with x. Considering the solid solution of magnetite and λ-Fe2O3as a defect vacancy form of magnetite, Fe3+[Fe3+1+2δFe2+1-3δbox$^b$δ]O4where δ = x/3, it is suggested that the increase in Hcwith x is due to a Fe2+-box$^b$interaction producing a preferred alignment of the vacancy on an octahedral site, which in turn would produce an additional uniaxial anisotropy superimposed on the cubic anisotropy. This interpretation is supported by the observed variation of Hcwith time for compositions within the system. The optical absorption coefficient at 0.63 μm and the optical Faraday effect also are functions of the value of x. The decrease in α with x is associated with the decrease in Fe2+content, while the decrease in θ is associated with the near equality of the opposing contribution to the rotation of the Fe3+ions on the octahedral and tetrahedral sites, respectively. Thin films of compositions in the above system have been deposited on glass disks suitable for disk-file applications. Typical recording outputs are shown."
"A relation is derived between the volume expansion and the magnetostriction at low temperatures of a noninteracting electron gas, and the results are compared with magnetostrictive measurements on paramagnetic transition metals made by Fawcett [1]."
"A close relation between the lattice parameter a and magnetic moment μ was found in alloys containing 3d transition metals. The relation can be described by a simple equation:a(x) = a_{0}^{A} \\cdot (1-x) + a_{0}^{B} \\cdot x + C \\mu(x). In Fe-Ni alloys, the magnetic term persists above Tc in the nickel rich region and decreases with temperature in the Invar region. This fact is interpreted as meaning that in the nickel rich region, localized atomic moments persist above Tc, while in the Invar region, they collapse above Tc. Many anomalous properties of the Invar alloys are explained as a result of the collapse of localized moments."
"A quantitative theory for the magnetostriction due to exchange interactions in metals has been developed, based on the ideas of Zener. The theory is in good agreement with the measured values for pure nickel and iron, and it explains the anomalous thermal expansion in the iron-nickel Invar alloys, as well as more complex alloys containing manganese and/or cobalt."

"The magnetic properties of compressed powder cores made of iron powder with high compressibility were investigated with the goal of making them practical in electric motors. An electrolytic iron powder and an atomized iron powder with a finely powdered resin were compacted under a pressure of 6 tons/cm2. The influence of iron particle size on magnetic properties was more marked in the atomized iron powder core. For the electrolytic iron powder core, magnetic properties perpendicular to compacting direction were superior to those of the atomized iron powder core, but higher magnetic anisotropy was induced. The compressed iron powder cores were used successfully for small electric motors."
"It is shown that the effect of an induced anisotropy energy due to directional order in Fe40-Ni60 is strongly dependent on the sample-to-volume ratio. Torodial samples of various thickness (6,3,1,0.5 mm) were machined from the same ingot, chemically etched, and annealed at 1300°C in H2. All further annealings were performed at 450°C in N2in one of the following magnetic conditions: a) demagnetized state; b) under magnetic field; c) remanent state. After these annealings loops show a constricted shape (a), a closely square shape with small coercive field Hc(b), or a square shape with large Hc(c). However, the width of the constricted region after annealing a), and the magnitude of Hcafter b) or c), are found to increase for decreasing sample thickness; in general, changes of loop shape induced by a given annealing are markedly stronger on thinner specimens. These differences are attributed to some influence of sample surface on the thermomagnetic treatment. This conclusion was further checked by electrochemically etching off a sample layer (0.01-0.1 mm); as a consequence the shapes of the loops obtained by the previous annealing suffered changes which were strongly different depending on the original thickness of the sample. It is qualitatively observed that the induction of a directional anisotropy energy Kuoccurs according to the domain pattern present during annealing, and that surface patterns are certainly characterized by smaller spacings of 180° domains and larger densities of 90° closure domains than are bulk patterns. Therefore the effectiveness on the loop shape of a Kudistribution in a surface layer is stronger than the one of a Kudistribution induced in a bulk layer. By etching off a sample layer, the new surface domain pattern bears little correlation to the old Kudistribution, and there is a memory loss of previous annealing results, which is more pronounced on samples with larger surface-to-volume ratios."
"Dislocations were introduced into specimens of Fe-3.25% Si alloys by plastic deformation and their density and distribution were controlled by annealing at various temperatures. Measurement of the coercive field Hc, the initial susceptibility χi, and the dislocation density N showed that Hcvaries as\\sqrt{N}and χiand1/\\sqrt{N}. The temperature dependence of Hcand χiof deformed and undeformed specimens was investigated. The coercive field of undeformed specimens stays constant between -196° and 200°C and drop steadily at higher temperatures. The Hcof deformed specimens increases to a maximum with rising temperature and then drops steeply near the Curie temperature. With an increase in the degree of deformation the maximum in Hcoccurs at lower temperature. The χi-T behavior of the undeformed specimen measured between -196°C, and the Curie temperature exhibits a minimum around room temperature (RT) and a second minimum around 450°C. At the first maximum at 350°C the χiachieves a magnitude of almost three times its RT value. With increasing deformation the first maximum is gradually flattened. During the isochronal annealing of the deformed specimens between 100°C and 800°C the Hcand χiremain constant up to about 200°C. Above this temperature the Hcincreases to a maximum and then drops gradually with rising temperature, while χidrops to a minimum and then steadily increases with rising temperature. During the isothermal recovery at lower temperatures the Hcexhibits an initial increase followed by gradual drop to lower values. The χidrops initially to a minimum and then increases with annealing time."
"The magnetic aftereffect and induced uniaxial anisotropy Ku have been studied between 50° and 300°C in the CoxFe3-xO4+γsystem with0.0025 \\leq x \\leq0.0150. A peak of disaccommodation (DA) found between 110° and 140°C is followed at higher temperature by a new phenomenon called \"accommodation of the permeability\" (A) that gives, according to the composition, a negative minimum on the DA curve located between 200° and 230°C. The amplitude of the minimum increases with x. The maximum amplitudesKu_{\\max}on the curves Ku =f (θ) are proportional to x. The two effects A and DA are due to the presence of Co2+ions. A hypothesis is proposed to explain the A phenomenon."
"Further experiments have confirmed that the thermal expansion coefficient α for 35% Ni Invar is independent of magnetic field at low temperatures, so that3\\partial\\alpha/\\partialH \\ll \\partialh'/\\partialT, whereh'is the forced magnetostriction coefficient. This and other evidence of irreversibility is briefly reviewed and compared with other recent data on some Fe-Ni-Co alloys. The evidence points to a freezing-in of a state of strain corresponding to higher temperatures, with the mechanism on a scale small compared to that of the domain structure. This is important in allowing discrimination against models of Invar which cannot provide such a mechanism."
"Bubble technology offers several operations that have no equivalents in technologies based on magnetic recording. Examples of such operations are transfer, reversal of the direction of propagation, and opening and closing of gaps in the data stream. This paper shows how such operations can be used to dynamically reallocate data in the bubble memory, causing it to become an integrated memory hierarchy. A model is presented which relates the bubble memory with dynamic reallocation to stack processing, a technique used in the evaluation of memory hierarchies. With the aid of this model it becomes possible to calculate the performance of the bubble memory using published data derived from the traces of selected typical programs. Design parameters are proposed for a 2 Mbit bubble memory with 128 detectors which in the execution of such programs requires an average of only 8.8 shifts for access and an average of 12 shifts per memory cycle. If bubbles are propagated at a rate of 1 MHz, the average access and cycle times for this memory become 8.8 μs and 12μs, respectively. Such performance, in combination with the low cost per bit offered by bubble technology, is expected to have a major impact."
"The possible uses of magnetic bubbles in memory systems have been discussed before. Dynamic data reallocation, a technique that may open wider areas of use for bubble memories, is discussed in a companion paper. Another challenging area of application appears in digital switching networks as suggested before. The bubble functions required in such a network may be largely the same as those necessary in the realization of a mass memory. After reviewing the data on the characterization of the devices that have been designed to perform these functions, it may be concluded that a bubble network is feasible."
"Mössbauer spectroscopy is a useful tool for characterizing certain properties of magnetic materials. Much of the information available from Mössbauer spectroscopy requires a detailed analysis of hyperfine parameters; a brief discussion of this analysis for Fe57in the presence of mixed magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole interactions is given. Several examples of experimental studies on iron containing magnetic oxides are discussed which illustrate some of the more common uses of Mössbauer spectroscopy in applied magnetism. Experimental studies related to phase analysis, phase transitions, relative site populations, determination of magnetic ordering temperatures, and magnetic structure investigations are included."
"Effects of such ions as Co2+, Co3+, and Fe2+on the magnetooptical properties of Gd3Fe5O12were investigated. Single crystals in which a portion of Fe3+ions were substituted by these ions were grown from a molten PbO-PbF2flux. It was found that Co2+ions affected the infrared Faraday rotation remarkably, as well as the visible one, both due to spin-allowed crystal-field transitions. Co3+ions also affected the infrared rotation, but affected the visible one very little. The crystals which contain Fe2+ions exhibited no anomalous effect on the Faraday rotation in the infrared region, where a broad absorption occurred due to a charge transfer between Fe2+and Fe3+ions. In the visible region, however, both the Faraday rotation and the figure of merit were improved. The dominant contributor to this improvement is not likely to be Fe2+ions, but Pb2+ions which originate from the flux."
"A wide bandwidth scheme for the detection of the Faraday and Kerr effects is presented. An electrooptic modulator is utilized to give an output signal in the form of a 100% amplitude modulated carrier, and provides laser and surface noise rejection capability in a single-ended arrangement. The system configuration is such that problems of temperature sensitivity and drift associated with EO modulators have minimal effect on the overall performance."
"The characteristics of the multiple reflected light between two magnetic films are described. The case of double reflections, which reflects on a film and then reflects on the other film, is described with both calculation and experiment. Then, the case of general multiple reflections is calculated using the calculated results of single reflection and double reflection. An application of double reflection to the associative magneto-optic memory is also discussed."
"Three memory chip organizations (major/minor loops, decoders, and dynamically ordered shift registers) are described and assessed in terms of memory performance objectives."
"A new thin film memory has been developed. The memory plane is comprised of an NDRO storage array with fully integrated structure and the peripheral integrated circuits on the same substrate. The distinctive feature of this memory is the multilayered structure of a metal substrate, digit lines, and word lines covered by thin Permalloy keeper stripes with thin polyimide resin as the intermediate insulative layers. In order to realize a superior building block unit adaptable to any memory structure requirement, the memory plane is mounted on a printed circuit board whose physical dimensions are identical with those of the logic IC board."
"Very low processing costs may be obtained using the integrated magnetic memory technique. Then the price of the complete memory system is approximately the price of the electronics. Higher bit densities are very desirable in order to decrease the cost by decreasing the driving currents and in order to increase the speed by shortening the length of the digit and sense lines. This paper shows how it is possible to increase the density from 3500 bit/in2(first generation) to 20 000 bit/in2(second generation) and 500 000 bit/in2(third generation), thereby obtaining very new and interesting properties. For additional details, see Digests of the 1972 Intermag Conference (available from IEEE Headquarters)."
"By metal-cladding and drawing of semihard and soft magnetic materials, a simple toroidal core which has a nondestructive memory function was developed. The nondestructive property arises from the shift of the minor loop in the composite magnetic characteristic. The shift occurs either in the first and the third quadrants, or in the second and the fourth quadrants. This toroidal core utilizes the second type of shift, which is due to the exchange force between the two magnetic materials. The information is stored by means of the remanent state of the semi-hard magnetic material, and is read out through magnetization reversal of the soft magnetic material."
"Experiments have been performed on a disk type memory system employing stacked flexible disks. The basic experimental module consists of 128 Mylar disks 0.004 in. thick stacked together in an 11/4 in. high pack. Access is achieved by mechanically deforming apart the rotating disks which are of different diameters. Although such memory modules possess a number of mechanical and wear problems, an analysis indicates that such modules could be used to construct a 1012bit memory with a read write access time of a second or less. In addition, it appears such a memory would occupy a relatively small volume."
"Both coercivity and saturation magnetization of a CrO2decrease with increasing temperature and the remanent magnetization determined by a small magnetic field at a temperature near the Curie point increases sufficiently when it cools down to room temperature. A new thermomagnetic recording method of an analog signal on a CrO2tape was tried by using a conventional magnetic head and a laser beam as a heating source. Recording is achieved by locally raising the temperature of the tape and applying simultaneously a small magnetic field which varies with the input signal. A conventional magnetic head was used for reproduction. From the result of a series of experiments, it can be concluded that this new recording method has the following characteristics. 1) Liberation of heat makes it possible to record the signal by a small magnetic field. 2) In spite of no-bias recording the reproduced output is linearly proportional to the recording current. 3) This method can be used for fairly high density analog recording (track width 20 μm, recording wavelength 10 μm)."
"The decay of a magnetic scale signal due to repeated reading is measured, and its relation to the magnetic properties of the recording material is studied. A sine-wave signal of wavelength 0.2 mm is recorded on Cu-Ni-Fe alloy plates 0.3 mm thick. The signal is read by a flux-sensitive multigap reading head. It is found that the penetration of the recorded signal into ordinary Cunife (Cu:Ni:Fe = 60:20:20; Br= 5 kG, Hc= 370 Oe) is only a few μm. Both the \"magnetic wear\" and the depth of the signal penetration has been improved over Cunife by reducing the Br/Hcratio down to about 5."
"To measure the strength of ferrites for video heads of small-size video tape recorders, deflection, crack, and scratch tests are performed. The breaking point of the ferrites is approximately 1/10 to 1/8 of that of Alfesil. As to the single crystal ferrites, the strength reduces about 20-25% when a tension is applied to the"
"The Pioneer Jupiter spacecraft was required to have a sufficiently small magnetic field that accurate interplanetary-magnetic field measurements would not be compromised. In order to control the magnetic field throughout the program a running account of spacecraft magnetic fields was maintained by means of a periodically updated magnetic model. This model was used to make economic tradeoffs in subsystem magnetic moments within the allowed magnetic budget. The program was culminated with a measurement of the magnetic field of the spacecraft. A description of the magnetic tests and a comparison with estimates made with the magnetic model are also presented."
"A new process for making acicular Fe-Co alloy particles for high density recording tapes and for master tapes of magnetic contact printing is presented. The method consists of adsorption of Co(OH)2colloid on the surface of fine goethite particles, heat treatment at 700°C in air to diffuse Co++ into the particles, followed by reduction to the metallic alloy state. The alloy powders with 10 to 50 atm % of Co showed coercive force higher than 1000 Oe and saturation magnetization greater than 160 emu/g. The characteristics of new alloy powder tapes prepared by the adsorption method are measured and comparison with those of CrO2and γ-Fe2O3tapes are given."
"Plated magnetic film wire memory elements must remain cost competitive with alternate memory elements or they will disappear from the commercial market. Substantial progress toward this goal is continuing in four areas. 1) High capacity memory modules with 5000 bits per square inch, or more, are being developed. 2) Use of new tests and substrate preparation processes make possible 50 bits per inch of wire on 2.5 mil diameter wire. 3) Plating process improvements make stable, repeatable high yield possible. Peak yield of 90% to 95% and large volume yield of 45% to 55% have been achieved. 4) Better understanding and new tests for disturb phenomena avoid design and performance problems. Automatic memory array test equiment provides economical high precision testing."
"The literature describes plated wire suitable for nondestructive read-out (NDRO) memory operation, prepared from different NiFe electrolytes and process sequences. The NiFe films may be grouped into three categories based on the differences in their Ni-Fe composition fluctuation. In this paper, two types of NiFe electrolytes are studied. The development of NDRO characteristics is shown to require different processing for each electrolyte because of the differences in electrochemical behavior of the electrolytes and the metallurgical structures produced. The stabilization and aging of these films also depend on processing. The maximum temperature used for stabilization depends on the thiourea concentration in the NiFe bath and is independent of the nature of the substrate and the film thickness. Above this maximum temperature, changes in properties depend on the composition gradient in the film and on the differential thermal expansion between substrate and film. Magnetostriction changes during stabilization are observed and explained by interdiffusion with the substrate or homogenization of the film. These changes also reflect the different composition gradients of the films. Aging of wires decreases with decreasing concentration of thiourea; greater stability is shown to be most likely due to the large grain size and low impurity concentration of the NiFe films. Preliminary evidence from films made with saccharin containing electrolytes suggests that similar effects are present."
"Manufacturing techniques of plated wires have rapidly developed and uniform characteristics and stable reproductivity, even for long wires, have been accomplished. Magnetic films used in Japan are typically from three to five multilayered in order to broaden operating margins and for better control of the characteristics. The method of fabricating word lines with keepers by automatic weaving machines is one of the unique techniques of Japan. The fabrication technique used in forming digit lines into a laminated cable eliminates connections between the planes and reduces the assembling cost. Adhesion type planes, which have several spare bits, are suitable for manufacturing large capacity modules at low cost. Several improvements are also employed in the tunnel structure. FSM is concentrated upon because of its miniaturization and combination with the IC techniques. The total number of planes and memory systems produced and sold in Japan has reached 3 × 108bits in capacity. And the annual production quantity is nearly 10% of core memories. Further promotion of use for wire memories is expected by realizing the following: 1) improvements of bit density (more than 500 bit/cm2); 2) stable connection at low cost; 3) standarizations of wire, plane, and IC for read-write circuits; and 4) widespread and closely knit exchange of technical information among wire people."
"Analyses have been made of the design parameters which affect the magnetic lift and drag forces on the magnetically suspended very high speed train models of practical interest. In the suspension systems investigated here, the superconducting magnets are installed in the train and the roadbed is equipped with normal-conducting coils. As a result of this investigation, an improved suspension system is proposed, which consists of \"ladder-type conductor\" in the roadbed. This new system is investigated theoretically."
"Several fields of research demand very high magnetic field intensities with the largest possible radial and axial access volumes for samples and beams. To achieve this objective while maintaining the best possible uniformity places stringent demands upon the superconductor and the design procedures. Conventional rectangular cross-section windings cannot always be designed to make efficient use of the winding volume. This paper describes the use of superconductive tape modules wound with a \"slant\" to the module face as a means of maximizing the field intensity and achieving useful aperture and sample access with optimized magnet geometry. The angle of the slant is influenced by the desired aperture angle of the radial access port at the magnet midplane. Techniques are described for exact calculations of the axial magnetic field intensity for the slant winding geometry: also, examples will be given of construction techniques and performance."
"Between April 1, 1970 and November 1, 1971, 32 500 acceptable arrays of Mated-FilmTMelements were produced. These 35 million bits were produced at an average rate of 1.75 and a maximum rate of 5.5 megabits per month. The results of this pilot run were to point out, first, that film memories can be produced for high-performance military systems at lower cost and with better reliability than core; and secondly, that the four metallic layers can be deposited with an overall yield of 60%. However, maximum cost effectiveness can probably be obtained by placing the greater priority on product through-put. The continuous deposition system is most compatible with the NiFe film because of the 1% NiFe ratio control needed for zero magnetrostriction. This is easily achieved by a steady-state electronically controlled source. Limitations in speed, start-up, and stabilization time, and machine reliability were all noted in the continuous coater during this run. The equipment for the expanded facility, designed according to these findings, is expected to at least double the output and to halve the production costs. The new equipment cost is approximately 5 kilobucks per megabit per year."
"Flux creep phenomenon occurs when a magnetic sample is displaced inside a superconducting solenoid. The magnetization measurement by the classical flux integration technique is disturbed by this phenomenon. We describe a method to eliminate this perturbation. At a fixed field, using a special compensated pick-up coil, the measurements, done at regular intervals, tend toward a final value proportional to the moment. Using an integrating digital voltmeter as fluxmeter, the short term reproducibility reaches 2 to 3.10-6. The apparatus is automatic. It allows measurements such as high field susceptibilities, law of approach to saturation, and anisotropic spontaneous magnetization."
"The validity of the assumptions made to explain the writing process in MnBi thin films is discussed, with reference to experimental results. We show that the magnetization behavior versus temperature can be explained by a second order magnetic transition. The comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental results corroborates this assumption and indicates that both nonsaturation of the written bit and domain wall motion must be taken into account in the dynamical description of the writing processes."
"The magnetocrystalline symmetry and the Curie temperature of six families of quasi-binary rare earth-cobalt-iron intermetallic phases were studied. Investigated were the phases R2(Co1-xFex)17of the light rare-earth elements R = Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Y and also of Ce-rich mischmetal (MM). In the Sm system, the terminal compound Sm2Co17has an easy c axis and the easy-axis symmetry persists up tox \\approx 0.5. The Nd alloys have an easy basal plane for all values of x. In the other systems, small iron substitutions change the easy-plane behavior of the R2Co17to an easy-axis anisotropy. The easy-axis ranges arex \\approx 0.05to 0.45 for Ce,x \\approx 0.2to 0.6 for Pr,x \\approx 0.1to 0.5 for Y, andx \\approx 0.1to 0.45 for MM. The Curie temperatures are high, between 600°C and 940°C, in these ranges. It is concluded that some of the alloys investigated are promising candidate materials for use in improved \"rare earth-cobalt\" magnets."
"The design and implementation of a laser mass memory system of 1012bits gross capacity is discussed. The major system design considerations and implementation constraints are described. Data are permanently recorded in the form of track-oriented patterns of vaporized regions on a reflective metallic recording surface. The system is composed of two major elements, the laser recorder unit and the recorder control unit. The optical path configuration of the laser recorder unit is described, together with the use of an intensity-modulated laser beam to thermally vaporize and reflectively read data patterns on a rotating strip of the recording medium. The operation of the recorder control unit, in conjunction with both the permanent recording and nondestructive retrieval processes is discussed, as well as its interface with a host computer. A typical track-oriented data organization is described, and information is provided regarding data capacity, access timing, and data rates of an operational laser mass memory system."
"Polarized (circularly and linearly) recoil-free γ rays have been utilized in recent years in various experiments. Of particular interest are investigations with linearly polarized γ rays. Various methods of producing linearly polarized recoil-free γ rays will be discussed. Examples will be presented where the spin orientation in a magnetic material and the principal axis of the electric field gradient were obtained by rotating a crystal to the position giving maximum or minimum resonance absorption. In a Mössbauer polarimeter the dispersion associated with the resonance absorption is of interest. The Mössbauer-Faraday effect and Mössbauer magnetic double refraction have been observed."
"The nuclear magnetic resonance of Co59nuclei in precipitates from Cu-3.52%Co and Cu-19%Ni-18%Co alloy powders aged at 600°C after solution heat treatments has been observed with a pulsed technique. The observed spinecho spectra for the Cu-3.52%Co alloy indicate that the precipitates have f.c.c. structure and their Cu concentrations are extremely small. In the case of the Cu-19%Ni-18%Co alloy, the observed distribution of resonance frequencies suggests that a completely random solid solution cannot be obtained by quenching and that concentration fluctuations exist in this alloy even immediately after quenching from 1075°C."
"There are two modes of collective oscillations of spins in AFEP's: a gyrotropical (in relation to magnetic moment) mode with frequencies ω1Kand an ungyrotropical one with ω2K. Their strong nonlinear connection gives rise to some effects of technical interest both for cm and mm ranges of microwaves: mixing of oscillations, parallel pumping, biresonance frequency doubling, etc. The influence of magnetoelasic (m.e.) interaction on ω1Kis amplified by exchange field HE:\\omega_{10}/\\gamma)^{2} = H(H + H_{D}) + 2H_{E}H_{mes}(P)where, for hematite (α-Fe2O3), HE= 9.2×106Oe and, from our measurements, Hmes(P)= (0.74 - 6.0p) Oe at T = 300 K,p\\parallel\\overrightarrow{H}\\perpC_{3}, and0.1 \\leq p \\leq 1.5 kbar. Because of this, a performance of simple microwave power piezomodulator for mm range is possible even with a single crystal which is not of high quality (\\Delta\\omega_{10}/\\gamma\\sim450Oe). The \"shear\" m.e. interaction leads to a strong dependence of the sound velocity in hematite on magnetic field:V_{s} = V_{scs} [1 - 2H_{E}H_{s}/(\\omega_{10}/\\gamma)^{2}]^{1/2}. The field variations of eigenfrequencies of hematite single crystal balls quasielastic oscillations, detected with the help of AFMR, give Hsup to 0.7 Oe."
 "Characteristics of holography using binary photosensitive materials were investigated by analytical calculations and computer simulations in relation to the hologram recording conditions. It was concluded that by choosing proper intensities of object beam and reference beam for the threshold of the photoresponse, some degree of fidelity can be attained in the reconstructed images. It was also concluded that in the holographic memory where a page composer of a bit array is used, the number of the bits of the array should be limited to a small number (say 10 to 20 for one dimension) to get a clear distinguishability between \"1\" and \"0\". The above results are applicable to the holographic recording on magnetooptic thin films which are more or less binary in their photoresponse."
"MnBi thin films have been studied as a magneto-optical memory element. Ordinarily, restricted conditions are required for preparing pure MnBi film with excellent properties and homogeneity. However, in the case of Mn-Bi-Te films, it was found that adopting the proper composition made it easy to prepare homogeneous films, and the figure of merit F/α was not worse than that of pure MnBi reported by other authors. Furthermore, the Faraday rotation was controlable by varying the composition of Mn-Bi-Te. Then, magnetic holograms were formed using the Mn-Bi-Te films exhibiting magnetization in a direction perpendicular to the film plane. The dependence of the diffraction efficiency on Faraday rotation and holographic writing conditions are reported."
"The purpose of this study was to further elucidate the post-sintering heat treatment response of liquid-phase sintered cobalt-samarium magnets. Specimens water quenched from temperatures between 500°C and the prior sintering temperature, 1117°C, were subjected to magnetic and X-ray diffraction analyses. All specimens contained a mixture of samarium oxides, one of which was cubic Sm2O3. A new and unidentified phase was found to appear at 750°C. This corresponded to a minimum in the coercivity similar to that reported by Westendorp. No evidence of a precipitate phase clearly related to the obtention of high coercivity was found, contrary to Westendorp's suggestion. The magnetic properties and X-ray diffraction data for selected specimens are given."
"Instabilities of spin waves in an axially magnetized YIG rod are studied in the volume magnetostatic and magnetoelastic regions using a spectrum analyzer. In the magnetoelastic region, the strength of the static magnetic field at which the resonance absorption occurs decreases with increasing input microwave power. When the input power reaches a threshold value, each absorption peak shows an abrupt jump and instabilities appear with oscillation frequencies of 300 kHz to 10 MHz. Instabilities may attribute to the second-order parametric process of the volume magnetostatic waves. In the magnetoelastic region, the intensities of the spectrum in lower sidebands are much larger than those in higher sidebands. However, in the volume magnetostatic region, the intensities of the spectrum in lower and higher sidebands have nearly equal amplitudes."
"Studies of sound velocity changes and attenuation changes in the vicinity of phase transitions provide interesting insight into the static and dynamic properties of the system undergoing the transition. In our laboratory, we studied the following cases: 1) magnetic phase transitions in rare earth metals Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, and in magnetic insulators EuO, RbMnF3and MnF2; 2) spin reorientation transitions in ErFeO3and Gd; 3) structural transition, induced by an optical phonon instability in SrTiO3; 4) structural transition, induced by an electronic instability (cooperative Jahn-Teller phase transition) in the Ni-Zn-chromite system and in DyVO4(in both cases the structural transition occurs at a higher temperature than the magnetic transition); 5) nematic-isotropic transition in the liquid crystal MBBA. In the order-disorder phase transition valuable information can be gained from attenuation and velocity measurements about the relaxation time of the order parameter or of related quantities. In the case of displacive phase transitions, the main effect is a resonant interaction of the sound wave to the soft mode, the latter being thek=0spin wave mode for spin reorientation transitions, an optical phonon mode for the structural transitions encountered in perovskites and an electronic excitation for the cooperative Jahn-Teller transitions. For additional details see, Digests of the 1972 Intermag Conference (available from IEEE Headquarters)."
"A study has been made of a magnetooptic disk memory using MnBi thin films. The present experimental device is equipped with a MnBi medium vacuum deposited on a glass disk 139 mm in diameter and 20 mm thick, and with a rotation mechanism in which gas bearings were employed. A writing clock frequency of 1 MHz, a bit diameter of 2 μm, a bit density of 220 bits/mm, a track density of 170 tracks/mm, and reading at 5 MHz have all been achieved. In this case, the writing conditions were a writing power of 70 mW, a medium speed of 5.2 × 103mm/s, and a pulse duration of 400 ns. The empirical relationships among the medium speed, laser power for writing, and the light pulse duration are in good agreement with the theoretical ones."
"A transducer for compressive force using Mn-Mg and Ni-Zn ferrite is offered in this paper, based on the magnetomechanical effect that the magnetic characteristics of the material are influenced by mechanical stress. They can be realized by applying a Royer's and Marzolf's circuit. The input to the transducer is pressure, and the output is an oscillator frequency. The change of the magnetic characteristics caused by repeated application and removal of 1.8 kg/mm2pressure can be reversible. With a Marzolf type transducer, at low pressure the input-output characteristic shows a hysteresis till 0.9 kg/mm2, but at higher pressure than 0.9 kg/mm2the characteristics are completely linear. With a Royer type transducer the characteristics are almost linear, although a little hysteresis is found over the range from 0 to 1.8 kg/mm2. The experimental results show that at low pressure the characteristics are nonlinear, including the hysteresis, and the influence of the temperature is 1.2%/°C over the range from 18 to 30°C. The method is also useful in the case of investigating the flux reversal mechanism under various stress conditions."
"Using gadolinium and manganese germanide crystals we have previously demonstrated the feasibility of fast broad-band pyromagnetic detectors utilizing the critical transition of their spontaneous magnetization. In the present study we have carried out a formal thermodynamic analysis of other reversible quasi-static pyromagnetic phenomena in an attempt to discover new detection mechanisms. The formal result was applied to the case of a uniaxial ferromagnet and the results compared with experiments on gadolinium single crystals. The pyromagnetic response associated with a transition of the hard axis component of the magnetization is in good qualitative agreement with the theory. We also predict a significant increase in the response of the easy axis component with a field applied along the hard axis, but this has not yet been observed. We have made initial measurements of the pyromagnetic response at the Meissner transition of superconducting lead and tantalum. Their pyromagnetic response peaks near the critical point and has a field dependence consistent with their demagnetizing factors. The latter are at present limiting the responsivities to a few volts/watt."
"Optical data storage provides a solution for the requirements of large read-write mass memories (capacity greater than 108bits) with small random access time (typically several μs) with high speed data transfer rates (0.1-1 Gbit/s). The well-known properties characteristic of holographic storage, including lensless stigmatic imaging capabilities and redundancy, make the holographic storage technique attractive. When using a two-dimensional storage medium, theoretical studies indicate that an information density on the order of 2 × 106bit/cm2are obtainable, or a wavelength of 0.5 μm. Even if one used optical components (lenses, etc.) having transverse dimensions as large as 80 cm, such a system would be limited to a capacity of about 1010bits. To obtain larger capacities it will be necessary to use a 3-dimensional storage medium allowing superposition of the stored information. This could be obtained by varying the angle of the holographic reference beam. A practical system for realizing such a memory is presented here. The organization of the memory is compatible with the use of a reversible storage material. The read-write functions are realized using an acoustooptic deflector, which eliminates any mechanically moving parts. The organization permits the use of a second deflector to vary the reference angle and allows superposition of holograms [1]. Possible recording materials which could be used in such memories are ferroelectric crystals or ceramics. Experiments in our laboratory have demonstrated the possibility of electrically controlling the fixation and erasure of holograms in these materials [2]."
"Unusually large magnetostrictions at room temperatures characterize the TbFe2region of the TbxFe1-xalloy system (x ranges from zero to one). We have measured the room temperature magnetostriction of various members of this system. The temperature dependence of the magnetostriction in TbFe2and ErFe2shows good agreement with single ion theory. The room temperature magnetostriction of TbFe2asH\\rightarrow\\infinwas found to be 2940×10-6whereas it is 5100×10-6at 0 K for TbFe2and -2200×10-6at 0 K for ErFe2."
"New values have been obtained for the magnetoelastic coefficients h3and h4of nickel at room temperature from ferromagnetic resonance experiments on"
"A study was made of the magnetic and mechanical properties of the alloys obtained by adding titanium and niobium to 4Mo-79Ni Permalloy. The mechanical hardness markedly increases with the addition of titanium, being about 240 in Vicker's hardness at 3% titanium, and about 300 at 3.5% titanium. One of the new alloys has μe= 12000 (0.22 mm, 1 kHz), Hc = 0.01 Oe, B10= 5000 G, and ρ = 98 μΩ cm at the composition of 3% Ti-2.8% Nb-3.8% Mo-10.5% Fe-0.5% Mn-balance Ni. Moreover, it is supposed that this alloy is hardened not only by solid solution hardening, but also by precipitation hardening because the coercive force decreases as hardness increases at the initial stage of hardening."
"The magnetic coupling between the magnetization in two nonmagnetostrictive Ni-Fe layers separated by a SiO layer has been investigated by means of a transverse susceptibility measurement. The main results are that 1) the coupling energy Ec per Unit area of the multilayered film has a form ofE_{c}= -A \\cos (\\phi_{1}-\\phi_{2}), where\\phi_{1}-\\phi_{2}is the angle between the magnetization vectors in the two Ni-Fe layers, and 2) the dependence of the coupling constant on the thickness b of the intermediate SiO layer can be interpreted quantitatively by the combination of the coupling energy due to Néel's topography model and that due to the magnetostatic interaction between the magnetic free poles appearing at the edges of the two Ni-Fe layers. The former coupling energy is given byE_{c1} = -\\frac{p}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\omega^{2}M^{2} \\exp(-\\sqrt{2}pb) \\cos (\\phi_{1}-\\phi_{2})wherep=2\\pi/LandLandware the wavelength and the amplitude of the undulation of the interface between Ni-Fe and SiO layers, respectively. The latter is given byE_{c2} = \\frac{2M^{2}D^{2}}{R} \\ln (\\frac{R}{D+b}) \\cos (\\phi_{1}-\\phi_{2})whereDis the thickness of each Ni-Fe layer, andRis the radius of the film."
"The relative remanence and the remanence coercivity of acicular single domain cobalt-doped gamma ferric oxide particles have been measured as a function of temperature and cobalt concentration. In addition, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy field of the same material has been measured separately on cubic shaped particles in the temperature range of 140-420°K and over a concentration range of 1.5- 14.5 wt % Co. The relative remanence of the acicular particles increases strongly with decreasing temperature below a temperature TKat which the ratio of shape to magnetocrystalline anisotropy is 0.86. TKis independent of a partial alignment of the particles. At temperatures below Tk, the remanence coercivity HRis found to follow reasonably well Néel's relation for crystalline anisotropy, HK= 0.32 HK."
"Various magnetic core models have been used in circuit analysis programs ranging from simple piecewise linear representations of the B-H loop [1] to more complex versions, which include core dynamics [2]. The model reported is based on a phenomenological approach to the magnetic core. The model accounts for major and minor B-H loops, including initial conditions. The model also includes a single parameter TC, which is used to account for core dynamics. Provision has been made for the introduction of an airgap, 1g, which permits analysis of circuits using gapped cores."
"This paper is concerned with the fundamental structure and the characteristics of the parametric sensor using binary phase \"0\" or \"π\", of an oscillation of the second harmonics. This sensor has a high sensitivity and a sharp directivity to the direct current magnetic field located near the head."
"Previous studies of magnetoelectric effect in Cr2O3employed collinear electric and magnetic fields along the rhombohedral c axis or perpendicular to it. They determined the diagonal elements of the rhombohedral magnetoelectric susceptibility tensor, i.e., α33and α11, respectively. This study applied orthogonaI electric and magnetic fields and determined for the first time the off-diagonal element α12by the measurement of the dielectric constant. Changes in the dielectric constant of Cr2O3were studied as a function of applied magnetic field. This relationship was found to be linear. At 8 kOe, orthogonal electric and magnetic field conditions were applied from room temperature to the Néel point (307 K) at frequencies of 1, 5, and 10 kHz. Changes in dielectric constants showed two maxima within the temperature range. By the use of equations for α33and α11given by Rado, the values for α12were obtained from the dielectric constant data. The temperature plot of α12, as shown below, showed two peaks in the neighborhood of the Néel point. The α12values vanished beyond this temperature range. From the symmetry consideration, off-diagonal α12values can only exist in Cr2O3when there are antiferromagnetic domains and the inter-domain walls lower the symmetry. The two peaks of α12are additional evidence for the existence of domains in Cr2O3."
"Experiments have been made for the purpose of producing superior magnetic heads in the audio frequency range. Sn substituted Mn-Zn single crystal ferrites are made using the Bridgman method, and under suitable annealing conditions an SnO2phase is precipitated. The precipitation direction of an SnO2phase coincides with the <110> direction of a spinel structure. By using head tip materials of SnO2precipitated Mn-Zn single crystal ferrite, superior magnetic heads, characterized by low noise and high wear resistance, have been obtained."
 "An experimental investigation has been conducted into the dependence of the read signal on flying height and medium thickness, employing a technique that permits the study of the effect of flying height and medium thickness on the same disk using the same slider. For the range of flying height (50-250 μin) and medium thickness (0-70 μin) investigated, excellent agreement with theoretical predictions is seen to exist for the maximum signal amplitude and half-pulsewidth of isolated pulses. It is further seen that the 6-dB packing density, calculated from half-pulsewidth measurements of isolated pulses, agrees well with experimental results."
"The flux lines in nonideal type II superconductors are pinned by imperfections so that they cannot move until the pinning force is overcome by a sufficient driving force produced by the transport current. The critical state specifies a current threshold beyond which a static configuration of flux structure no longer exists. It has been observed, however, that the threshold increases with the application of a longitudinal magnetic field. In order to investigate this threshold, a dynamic equation was derived by using the study of line vibrations by de Gennes and Matricon. Using this characteristic, we can make a new type of power cryotron. For additional details, see Digests of the 1972 Intermag Conference (available from IEEE Headquarters)."
"The J-H-T critical surface has been measured at temperatures near 4.2 K for diffusion-processed Nb3Sn and for Nb+60 wt % Ti superconducting alloys. The apparatus used for these measurements consists of a split Nb3Sn superconducting solenoid capable of fields up to 65 kOe, a 4-probe potentiometric sample holder capable of carrying currents up to 1000 A, and an enclosed cryostat which allowed one to vary the temperature of the coil and the sample from 3.4 to 4.8 K by varying the pressure over the liquid helium. Data are presented for the critical current density Jcand for the temperature dependence of critical current density (\\partialJ_{c}/\\partialT) observed at 4.2 K. From these data, the values for the two stability parameters of interest, the fractional temperature dependence of critical current density [-(1/J_{c}) (\\partialJ_{c}/\\partialT)] and the stability parameterJ_{c}^{2} [-(1/J_{c})(\\partialJ_{c}/\\partialT)], were calculated and are presented along with an estimate of the wire diameter required for adiabatic stabilization."
"We extend the micromagnetic description of magnetization reversal in long cylindrical particles to materials with magnetocrystalline anisotropy with the preferred axis coincident with the particle axis. The magnetocrystalline and shape anisotropy energies depend differently on the orientation of the magnetization. Because of this, neither magnetization curling (which is an exact solution for isotropic cylinders) nor magnetization buckling satisfy the nucleation equations exactly. However, magnetization curling and buckling may be used as overconstrained approximations to construct nucleation or switching curves for all orientations of the cylinder in an external field. Stability of nucleation is examined by calculating the free energy of magnetization to fourth order in the amplitude of the nucleation mode. The results of this calculation are useful in the construction of complete magnetization cycles."
"The importance of cubic magnetite powder containing cobalt is newly recognized for magnetic recording since it has excellent magnetic and paint characteristics. In this paper the conditions necessary for obtaining very thin films for recording media of high bit densities are given. For additional details, see Digests of the 1972 Intermag Conference (available from IEEE Headquarters)."
"For the purpose of getting the core material for the narrow-track magnetic head for video signal recording, thick magnetic film was deposited by the plasma-arc-sputtering technique and the operating characteristics of the head made from the film were examined. The results are as follows. 1) Sendust films up to 55 μm thick were able to form by the sputtering technique. 2) A mechanically hard film having a Vicker's hardness of 740 was obtained (hardness of bulk Sendust is 510). 3) The permeability of the film was located between the permeability of the super-finished sample and that of the etched one of bulk Sendust in the frequency range 1 MHz to 20 MHz (μ' is 60 at 9 MHz at the film thickness 30 μm). 4) With the experimental head whose track width is the same as the film thickness (22 μm), the sinusoidat wave signal up to 8 MHz was able to record and reproduce with the velocity 50m/s. 5) The picture signal of 1 TV field was recorded on one track of the magnetic sheet rotating at 60r/s. The resolution of the reproduced picture was 300 TV lines and the signal-to-noise ratio was 43 dB (p-p/rms)."
 "A study of the current requirement to cut a bubble from a strip domain in uniaxial magnetic materials was carried out experimentally and theoretically. The strip domains were cut by use of a current flowing through a fine gold wire. Various functions were used to simulate the shape of the walls just before cutting. It is found that good agreement with the measured values of a cutting field is obtained when the wall shape consists of sections of ellipses."
"A new γ-Fe2O3particle (RX-2228) exhibiting squareness ratios as high as 0.90 was compared with other γ-Fe2O3particles in the same tape formulation. The particle volume concentration was 11% larger and the Br 25% larger for RX-2228. The anhysteretic susceptibilities for an unoriented and oriented RX-2228 tape (having the same Br) were 2.12 and 2.72, respectively. Surprisingly, the long wavelength sensitivity was the same for the two tapes. The recording advantages of RX-2228 arise from a greater tape Br and a switching field distribution which is half that of commercial tapes. Compared with a professional mastering tape, RX-2228 was better by 3.1 dB in S/N ratio, 3.3 dB in saturated output at 500 Hz, and 4.3 dB in saturated output at 15 kHz at 7-1/2 in/s."
"In addition to a memory apparatus, one of the applications of thin Permalloy wires is a fail-safe element using a thin film parametron (T.F.P.). \"Parametron\" has been known as the failsafe element in automatic control fields. The T.F.P. is more suitable to the fail-safe element than a ferrite one with regard to speed, stability, and size. Thin Permalloy wires used are 81 Ni-Fe alloy with a thickness of 1 μm electrodeposited onto copper wires with a diameter of 0.47 mm. The uniaxial field-induced anisotropy was in the peripheral direction, and the anisotropy field was about 200 At/m. Output voltages of the T.F.P. are more stabilized than those of a ferrite parametron. This is one of the reasons why the T.F.P. is recommended as a fail-safe element. A test set with a twin binary counter of seventeen digits using about 300 T.F.P. fail-safe elements has been operated satisfactorily with an exciting current of 0.2 A rms and 50 kHz clock."
"An electrically alterable read only memory module using NDRO plated wire cables has been designed to store the fixed programs of electronic exchange systems. The capacity of the memory system is 1080 kbits (4 modules) and the read cycle time 1.44 μs. The magnetic film of plated wire consists of five layers (Permalloy and Ni-Co films) on 0.1-mm-diameter Be-Cu wire. The 72-pair plated wires 50 m long are laminated between polyester tapes and are formed as a plated wire cable. A pair wire forms a bit (2 cross point/bit). The memory module consists of 16 memory planes stacked and involves 8192 33-bit words (270 336 bits) in total. An address has 8 words and is selected through a diode matrix built in the module. The plated wire cables are folded with no interconnection like the twister module. The digit (Id) and word current (Iw) operating ranges in this module are 68 to 92 mA and 270 to 320 mA, respectively. 5 mV is specified as an allowable minimum output voltage. The ambient temperature range of this module is from 10 to 40°C. The temperature coefficient of the output voltage is approximately 0.0065/°C."
"In developing high-speed digital systems it is often necessary to use fast memories which are not directly available on the market. Our modular memory construction enables us to adjust the capacity of the memory within a wide range during assembly. The basic element of the memory plane is the word-line sheet provided with a twisted pair of wires-it holds two word lines and has 24 holes for the bit wires. The capacity of the memory plane can be increased by additional word-line sheets. The maximum capacity of our modular memory is at present 12 Kbits."
"In a circulator, the bandwidth is related to the difference of circularly polarized permeabilities of ferrite and the nonreciprocal filling factor which is defined in this paper. The relation is obtained for a general circulator. The measured methods and measured values of the nonreciprocal filling factor are shown for several types of circulators. Wide-band method is to use additional lossless networks such as a lumped circuit and λ/4 transformers. The second is to increase the energy for the same phase excitation. These techniques are described together with their experimental results. Using the latter technique, the arbitral value of the backward loss can be obtained, and an extremely wide-band isolator covering 3 octaves in the UHF band is shown as a practical example."
"Hot-pressed polycrystalline Ni-Zn ferrites have been prepared by two different technologies: the wet method and the ball-milling method. In the wet method, the ferrite was prepared from aqueous solutions of iron, zinc, and nickel hydrated sulphates which were dehydrated in a spray-drier at 250°C and decomposed at 800°C in air. In the ball-milling method, oxides of these same elements were used. It was observed that the wet method is better than the ball-milling technique for preparation of hot-pressed ferrites: coercive force Hcis lower, grain size is more homogeneous, initial permeability μ'0is increased, and it is easier to control grain growth after hot-pressing without recrystallization phenomenon. Furthermore, stoichiometry is a very important parameter to obtain the better compromise between initial permeability, electric resistivity, coercive force, and homogeneous grain size."
"The effect of annealing on the magnetic properties of cold-rolled samples of iron-rich Ni-Fe alloys was studied over the composition range between 20 and 40 percent Ni. The plastically deformed samples had a thickness reduction of about 99 percent, Changes in the crystallographic and magnetic heterogeneities were followed by means of the Mössbauer effect. The results are discussed in terms of the coexistence of fine dispersions of both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic α and γ phases, as well as by concentration fluctuations within each phase. It was shown that, at room temperature, marked changes in technical saturation magnetization loop squareness took place in the alloys with a composition close to 70 percent Fe, at which the α-γ phase boundary appears. The investigated quasi-static magnetic loops were cycled with a frequency of 2 Hz."
"Absorption (x\") tests are described which allow the selection of an optimum saturation magnetization (4πMs) for cryogenic ferrite circulators operating in the below resonance mode at L-band frequencies. The 1.5 GHz absorption spectra of a series of YAIIG ferrimagnets were measured at 300 K and 18 K as a function of dc magnetic field in a stripline structure which resembles the actual circulator configuration. At 300 K the samples behave as predicted by the Kittel equation. At 18 K the absorption curves are broadened and depend strongly on 4πMsin an unexpected manner. The below resonance x\" shows a minimum for an intermediate value of 4πMs(278 gauss at 292 K). Care was taken to ensure that the nonlinear RF threshold, which was measured to be about 1 microwatt, was not exceeded. Several cryogenic circulators using these materials were fabricated to demonstrate device performance at 18 K. In agreement with the x\" data, the circulator insertion loss exhibits a strong dependence on the saturation magnetization with a minimum loss occurring at an intermediate 4πMs(290 gauss at 292 K). The increased loss at 4πMsvalues less than 300 gauss may be attributed to a broadened resonance loss, while the increased loss at higher 4πMsvalues can be attributed to low-field loss."
"A distinct enhancement of the traditional circulator in both the isolation and operational bandwidths has been found to be realized by means of a trigonally symmetric magnetic system. Experiments utilizing the field probing scheme which the present author published previously have verified that the proposed magnet system significantly contributes to the simultaneous enhancement of both the bandwidth and the isolation, in that field concentration favoring isolation enhancement is realized, and that tapered field matching is established. The proposed new magnet system has enabled a compact C-band circulator to be implemented with isolation as high as 30 dB or more for a relative bandwidth of 27 percent while holding the insertion loss at less than 0.5 dB."
"A low temperature process for converting hematite (α-Fe2O3) thin films into magnetite (Fe3O4is described. The films produced are unambiguously identified as magnetite by several complementary methods of analysis. These include α-backscattering spectrography, X-ray powder diffractometry, and observations of electrical, magnetic, and optical properties."
"The thermal transfer process takes place at high temperatures, and the temperature which freezes the magnetization is distributed in some wide range depending upon the signal field strength, but most magnetization is frozen between 115°C and 120°C. The time constant of the changing magnetization and demagnetization field from frozen magnetization are very significant in the thermal transfer process. Because of the demagnetization field, thermoremanent magnetization becomes small and is limited to only the tape surface. The computed magnetization pattern of the slave tape indicates that the transfer characteristics of thermoremanent magnetization are similar to that of the anhysteretic method. In the thermoremanent magnetization process the magnetization recovers about 3 times the high temperature magnitude when it is cooled to room temperature. Consequently, a high output can be obtained by thermoremanent magnetization."
"The early stage of high speed switching can be studied with a sufficient time resolution by measuring the amount of the irreversibly reversed magnetization caused by short and giant pulse fields (0.5 ∼ 10 ns, 20 ∼ 50 Oe) as a function of the pulse duration. The experiment has been done by means of the Kerr magnetooptic measurement of the reversed magnetization after an irreversible magnetization reversal is caused by the pulse field in the presence of a crossed steady hard direction field. From the disturbing experiments of this magnetization reversal process, it is concluded that, because of the giant amplitude of the pulse field, the rotation angles of the magnetization come to have a widely spread spatial distribution during the short pulse duration. Therefore, a part of the magnetization which rotates beyond the hard axis at the end of the pulse field is irreversibly reversed completely in about 30 ns and after then remains without drastic changes. This gives the basis of the present new method to study the early stage of the switching. By means of this method it is found that the variation in the reversed magnetization at the early stage is not monotonic but oscillatory."
"This paper presents an extended Bloch-Néel wall-transition creep model in which the hard-locking effect, where the average magnetization does not return to the easy axis after the hard-axis fields have been removed, is included. The remarkable improvement in analog characteristics of electrodeposited thin magnetic film wire was accomplished by special driving pulse patterns based on this creep model. The resultant characteristics are appropriate for the analog memory devices used in pattern information processing systems."
"The magnetic properties of Fe-Cr-Co alloys as a function of the additional silicon content was studied. It was found that the magnetic properties depend on the compositions of the alloys and the best properties were obtained with an alloy of Fe-28wt%Cr-23wt%Co-1wt%Si. The energy product of this alloy attains 5.3 MGOe when it is step-tempered at low temperatures."
"This paper will review recent progress in disk recording with GaAs laser transducers and magnetooptical media. Reading and writing experiments have been performed at frequencies up to 5 MHz with a cryogenic disk assembly using Fe-EuO as the storage media. Experiments have been done with other magnetooptical materials such as intermetallics for room temperature operation. The efficiency, polarization, and lifetime of batch fabricated GaAs lasers will be described."
"Thin magnetic films (50-100% Ni-Fe) produced by vacuum evaporation at oblique incidence angles (θ) of 30° and 60° were irradiated by 250 kV deuteron dose (\\sim1 \\times 10^{13}/cm2.s) at temperatures below 50°C. The composition dependence of Ku(uniaxial anisotropy constant) of the films as depodited was almost linear, being positive and large at 50% Ni and slightly negative at 100% Ni. In the case of films of\\theta=30\\deg, a slight increase (Ni 80%) or decrease (Ni 80%) in Kufollowed by a slow decrease in|K_{u}|was observed with the increase in the irradiation dose. The behavior was almost independent of the direction of the magnetic field applied to the films during the irradiation. In the case of films of\\theta=60\\deg, the general behavior of Kuwith the irradiation was the same except that the initial increase or decrease was not clearly observed. These results were considered the result of irradiation enhanced vacancy migration which induced the change of shape and spacing of the \"columns\" developed in the oblique incidence evaporated films."
"The ferromagnetic exchange constant has been measured using spin wave resonance in a number of iron-nickel alloys covering the composition range 60% to 90% nickel. The exchange constant varies smoothly from a value of 1.3 (10-6) erg . cm-1at 60% Ni to an extrapolated value of 0.77 (10-6) at 100% Ni. The data are in significant disagreement with the values published by Rusov."
"A pulsed and flattopped switching magnet system has been developed for time sharing of the 12.5 GeV proton beam of the zero gradient synchrotron (ZGS) at Argonne National Laboratory. When pulsing this magnet during a 0.5 s long slow ejected beam spill of the ZGS to one experimental area, this spill is interrupted three times and the beam deflected 3° 10' to a bubble chamber experiment. The system is capable of repeating a flattop within ±0.005% for time periods ranging from a few μs to many ms. This is accomplished by charging the magnet in an LCR circuit to the desired field value, then \"crowbarring\" the magnet and holding the field constant with an energy source in the crowbar."
"Ferrite cores with rectangular hysteresis loops can store analog values if the flux φi, corresponding to the analog input information, is impressed upon the core. All known techniques, however, are applicable only for a single element, but not for a three-dimensional random access matrix because of physical or economical reasons. A new technique for the selection and driving of each core of a matrix for analog storage by three-coincident pulsewidth modulated currents was developed. To achieve the necessary linear relation between the input value and the impressed flux by voltage pulses of constant amplitude, the amplitude of thexandywrite current pulses is controlled by a reference core, while that of thezwrite pulse is regulated. The total error is within ± 1% for all matrix cores. Serial or parallel operation for writing and reading is possible as well as a quasi-nondestructive readout by quantization of the read analog value before rewriting."
"Permalloy films have been evaporated onto glass substrates rotating with 0.05 to 450 r/m in a d.c. magnetic field. The magnetic uniaxial anisotropy was measured by using a torque magnetometer and the hysteresis loop was taken by using a 50 Hz hysteresis loop tracer. The magnetic anisotropy and the coercive forces,H_{c\\parallel}andH_{c\\perp}, which are measured along the easy and hard axes, respectively, were obtained as a functions of the angle of ratations during deposition. The uniaxial anisotropy is found to decrease with increases in the rotating angle. No anisotropy was observed with rotating faster than π/2 r/m. The ratioH_{c\\parallel}/H_{c\\perp}, however, increase gradually for rotations beyond π r/m and becomes unity after about 5 revolution. This final state corresponds to that for the film with isotropic magnetic properties. Its hysteresis loop is quite rectangle in all directions in the film plane. A similar trend was obtained even though the ratation speed, the substrate tempertature, and the film thickness have been widely changed. These characteristics could be explained phenomenologically in terms of the postulated assumpution with the helical alignment of uniaxial anisostropy oriented through the film thickness direction."
"Multistable transfluxors may be used to construct memories for call-numbers such as are needed in telephony. The following described solution uses a transfluxor which can be set into ten different magnetic states by either a number of current pulses (one to ten) of constant amplitude and length or by single pulses of graded length. The transfluxor can be read out nondestructively. Reading may be performed to produce either a number of output pulses (1 to 10) or a single pulse of varying length corresponding to the stored flux. If in the latter case the read pulse generator has a repetition frequency of 10 Hz, the output pulses will be suitable for telephone dialing purposes after being shaped by a monostable circuit. In this article the principle of the device is described together with an application-a memory for a three-digit call-number."
"A 32 kbyte, 60 ns access time, 200 ns read/write cycle time, low cost (≤ 0.8¢ bit) planar magnetic film memory system is described. High-density (3500 bit/in.2), destructive read-out (DRO), coupled hard axis (CHA) magnetic film storage device arrays (integration level: 40 000 bits per 4.1 × 4.3 inch substrate) are batch fabricated by thin film deposition and photolithographic techniques. Monolithic integrated drive and sense circuits interface with emitter coupled logic (ECL) circuits and provide within one silicon chip the transition from stack transmission lines to logic levels. The memory is internally organized as 4096 word by 72 bit system. Compatible electronic packaging assembly and interconnection techniques are described. Cost considerations and extensions of the technology are discussed."
"The composition dependence of the magnetization of Mn-Al-B alloys can be interpreted quantitatively on the basis of the known magnetization value of an MnB(1:1) alloy and the following assumption: the Mn-Al-B alloy consists of an MnB(1:1) phase and an MnAl (remaining Mn:Al) phase, and the magnetization of this MnAl phase is equal to that of Mn-Al binary alloy with the same composition. The coercive forces of two phases in the Mn-Al-B alloy can be obtained separately from thedI/dHversusHcurve. Examination of the composition dependence of each coercive force reasonably shows that the two phases are the MnB and MnAl phases assumed above. This also suggests the presence of a magnetostatic interaction between the two phases."
"Magnetic properties of highly oriented rolled Cu-Ni-Fe alloys are examined to obtain a more detailed understanding of magnetic anisotropy and the process of magnetization reversal. Torque curves and electron micrographs confirm the existence of the predominating effect on the coercivity of the shape anisotropy which accompanies a spinodal decomposition. From the dependences of squareness ratio and coercivity on the angle between alignment (roll) direction and measuring field, the mechanism of magnetization reversal of the alloy is explained quantitatively by the curling model considering the interaction field. Comparison of the observed and predicted values for the rotational hysteresis integral\\int(W_{r}/I_{s})d(1/H)indicates strongly that the curling takes place in magnetization reversal."
"The remanent states after thermal and ac demagnetization (TD and ACD), dc and ac magnetization curves as well as the influence of the demagnetization temperature and magnetic field on the domain structure, were investigated on a small specimen of aluminium substituted strontium hexaferrite single crystal. It was found that the domain structure after ACD consists of a few domains only, while after TD it consists of a great number of domains with irregular Bloch walls. The TD states are very unstable and a transition to a similar ACD occurs in a field of about 50 Oe. These results were explained in terms of a simple model which takes into account the existence of magnetic inhomogeneities spread within the specimen."
"Samples consisting of approximately parallel arrays of ferromagnetic MnBi rods in a Bi matrix have been grown by directional solidification of eutectic Mn-Bi alloys. The rods are of order 1μm in diameter, and very long in comparison to their diameter. Room-temperature intrinsic coercive fields up to 30 kOe have been attained, suggesting that the rods show single-domain behavior. The measured magnetizations are substantially higher than expected from the known moment of MnBi and the predicted volume fraction of MnBi in the eutectic; this means that the MnBi in our samples has an abnormally high moment, or (more likely) that the MnBi content is higher than predicted from the phase diagram. Magnetic measurements on samples cooled to 77 K show a stepped hysteresis loop which is most simply interpreted as a superposition of two loops, indicating the presence of two different magnetic phases. One phase has low coercive field (< 1 kOe) and is probably \"normal\" MnBi, which is known to have low anisotropy at 77 K. The other phase has a Curie point near 270 K, and is presumably the phase found in similarly prepared samples by Noothoven van Goor and Zijlstra. In some samples, we find this phase has a coercive field of 120 kOe, and is not saturated at our maximum field of 145 kOe (all at 77 k). We have not yet been able to separate this phase from \"normal\" MnBi, and so do not know its morphology or magnetic properties. It seems likely that it has a magnetization at least as large as that of normal MnBi, and much higher anisotropy."
"In the second harmonic type magnetic modulators, the origin of noise is thought mainly to be from Barkhausen jumps. In this paper we describe one method of noise reduction. By using two frequency excitation, one (f1) at about 3 kHz, and the other (f2) higher by several hundred kHz, we observed considerable decrease of noise, about 1/10 of that of ordinary magnetic modulators with one frequency excitation. The mechanism of noise reduction was explained by solving the equation of wall motion when passing through the potential barriers in magnetic cores. The results obtained from our experiments are as follows. 1) At optimum frequency, decrease of noise is maximum. 2) With application of second high frequency excitation f2, signal to noise ratio increases. 3) The larger the amplitude of second frequency excitation, the lower the noise. 4) The effect of second frequency excitation on long time drift is small. The excitation source of f2may be a conventional one, and the distortion of its waveform is not a serious condition."
"The \"one-ion\" magnetoelastic coupling (mec) coefficients [1] b1and b2for the Fe3+ion, an octahedral position of YIG, were found from the composition dependence measurements of λ100and λ111. Their measurements were made by the FMR method on the crystals Y3Fe5-αScαO12(α = 0; 0.48). The coefficients b1and b2are b1= (19 ± 2).106erg.cm-3and b2= (9.3 ± 1).106erg.cm-3. Then the measurements of these values were made by the EPR method at the frequency 36 GHz in Y3Ga5O12with about 0.1% Fe: b1= (9.2 ± 4).106erg.cm-3and b2= (7.2 ± 2).106erg.cm-3. These values are in good conformity with FMR data. This fact proves a predominant role of \"one-ion\" mec in the formation of YIG magnetostriction."
"The fringing field and inductance of a typical video head are calculated numerically for geometries and permeabilities where the conventional approximations fail. The head material is assumed to be nonconductive and of constant isotropic permeability. The calculations, having no arbitrary factors, yield absolute results. Certain consequences of these findings on the write and reproduce processes are outlined."
  "A serial access memory is proposed based on the propagation of cross-tie walls and Bloch lines along domain walls in thin magnetic films. The techniques used to propagate bubbles may be applied to cross-tie walls and Bloch lines. This method shows promise because of the speed and density, the polycrystalline material, the large temperature range, and easy detection with a loop. The expected speed makes possible cheap detection, and as a result the need for magnetic logic is decreased. With propagation velocities within the range of domain tip velocities, a 100 MHz stepping rate can be expected. At this rate a 0.5 millivolt signal can be obtained from a loop as a Bloch line passes beneath it."
"An apparatus was developed which could display simultaneously the domain wall motions at many points of a magnetic core surface on an oscilloscope. It was observed that the motion of the domain walls fluctuated from cycle to cycle in an alternating field. It was found that these fluctuations could be reduced markedly by superposition of a pulse on the alternating field. The pulse was set at the saturating interval of the core in every half-cycle. The polarity of the pulse was chosen to further drive the core to saturation. A reduction ratio of 10:1 could be obtained easily with magnetically annealed cores."
"Formulations for spontaneous and forced volume magnetostriction and magnetic contribution to thermal expansion are given based on the itinerant electron model of ferromagnetism and by assuming that the change in volume of the system affects the bandwidth and the effective exchange interaction while the shape of the density-of-states curve remains unchanged. Applying the formulas to a step-type density-of-states curve, which we regard as the simplest one holding the most essential character of a 3d band of fcc transition metals, the spontaneous volume magnetostriction at 0 K and the magnetic contribution to thermal expansion in fcc Fe-Ni and Ni-Cu alloys are calculated."
"In the present paper, an approach is outlined to the solution of the transient eddy currents produced upon field switching in a thin nonmagnetic metal layer. The results may be used in evaluating the distribution of the transient volume force densities acting on the metal. Some of the fields in which problems of this kind arise are power equipment shielding, nondestructive eddy current test instrumentation, and magnetic levitation."
"A new type of magnetic signal mixing amplifier is introduced which is useful for the treatment of multisignals biased with different levels of potential. A saturable core and transistors are its basic components. This mixing amplifier is excellent in linearity, has push-pull with an inherently single core, has a quick response, and is operated with a dc source. Decoupling of the input and output is made possible by use of the three-core configuration. An arrangement is also presented in which the isolation of the output from the dc source can be attained by the use of other windings."
"A three phase transformer test facility has been used for measuring the localized power loss and flux distribution within the core. The flux and loss distributions in the T-joint of a core with simple double overlap joints have been investigated. The flux density distribution was measured by an array of search coils wound on individual laminations, and the localized power loss was found by measuring the initial rate of temperature rise using miniature thermocouples. For measurements made in the range of flux densities from 1.1 to 1.6 T, the inner edges of the yoke and limb laminations were the highest loss areas, up to 30% higher than the mean core loss. These regions of high power loss were found to be due to a high third harmonic flux density component being present. The fundamental component of flux density tended to follow the rolling direction of both yoke and limb laminations; however, some deviation from the rolling direction was present in the case of other harmonics."
"This article proves that the output from a ring core sensor is directly proportional to the first time derivative of the product of dynamic permeability and magnetic intensity perturbation within the core caused by an external, uniform magnetic field. (Dynamic permeability is defined to be the slope of the hysteresis loop at a given point in time.) Assuming that ellipsoidal shells can approximate the core, the demagnetization factor can be \"estimated\" in the first order to be proportional to the first power of the quantity tape thickness (or number of wraps) divided by the core diameter. The constant of proportionality is determined from laboratory data. When an additional scale adjustment is applied to the resulting sensor output formula, the computed output tracks laboratory data for a range of sensor geometries."

"Approximate analytic solutions of transient wall motion in a bulk ferromagnetic material are obtained from the dynamic torque equations with a Gilbert damping term. These transient solutions reduce to previously obtained well-known solutions under steady-state velocity conditions."
"The phenomenon of wall contraction characterized by a peak in the velocity-field relationship and a region of negative differential mobility is observed in uniaxial magnetic thin films of various magnetic properties by careful interrupted-pulse experiments. The observed results agree quite well with the theory for bulk samples when the extensive flux closure of thin film walls is accounted for by a suitable empirical scaling factor."
"The field gradients of magnetic stray fields which affect the propagation of cylindrical domains in a T-bar pattern are investigated. The magnetization of the Permalloy bars which gives rise to the propagating field gradient is found to be influenced by the stray field of the cylindrical domain itself. Considering this interaction, the propagating field gradients are calculated first for single bars and then for a geometric arrangement as it occurs in a T-bar pattern. Those forces leading to a forward propagation and those leading to a trapping of the domain are studied. Useful relations for the distance between the adjacent bars are deduced. The calculated propagating field gradient is found to have considerable local variations. This causes corresponding velocity variations of the domain. The marked velocity minima which occur along the domain path represent a strong restriction to high data rates in domain memory devices. Average propagation fields for the different propagation steps are shown as a function of the bar width."
"An experimental test set for magnetic bubble devices has been constructed in which the spacing between the garnet film and the Permalloy overlay is variable. The experimental uncertainty in spacing is approximately\\pm.15\\mum, and spacings as small as.5\\mum have been attained. Bias margin data are presented which were taken at 1 Hz on a 20 micron period chevron circuit as a function of spacing. The collapse and strip-out fields begin to be affected when the spacing is comparable to the garnet film thickness, increasing as the spacing decreases. At larger spacing the high-bias failure mode changes from collapse to uncorrelated bubble motion. A theoretical model which accounts for some aspects of the spacing dependence of the strip-out and collapse fields is described. This model approximates the circuit by a continuous Permalloy sheet. At the low spacing required for efficient use of the rotating field, the model indicates that ±10% nonuniformity in a 2 micron spacing over the device area results in a degradation of the bias field operating range by about 12%."
"Magnetic materials for an integrated magnetic core memory have been developed. The materials are for a storage layer about 1 μm thick and a low reluctance keeper layer. Materials investigated were Co-Ni-Fe for the storage layer and Cr-Ni-Fe for the keeper. Measurements were made ofH_{c}, B_{s}, B_{r}, \\lambda_{s}, S_{w}, H_{0}, and Hdisturb. Layer stress and adhesion were also measured. Special apparatus, which is described, has been developed to perform some of the measurements. Variation of properties with substrate surface, substrate temperature, and oxygen pressure during evaporation are reported."
"The memory-core characteristics of compositions in the system Li0.47-1/2x-1/2yCoxZnyNi0.06Fe2.47-1/2x-1/2yO4have been studied. The cobalt and zinc contents have been varied from zero to 0.02 and from zero to 0.12, respectively. It is demonstrated that small amounts of cobalt decrease the temperature coefficient of the coercive force and, in the zinc-containing materials, produce improved square-loop properties. These materials demonstrate improved pulse response properties when compared with unsubstituted lithium ferrite."
"Various magnetic properties of samples of single-domain particles dispersed in a nonmagnetic matrix are examined as functions of the packing fractionp. The range of variability ofpis from 0.0003 to 0.20. The squareness ratio and the rotational and alternating hysteresis integrals change withp, while the coercive field, the initial anhysteretic susceptibility, and the areas between the remanence curves are not dependent onp. These results are interpretated as a consequence of the formation of agglomerates interacting with each other, rather than as a consequence of analogous interactions among the single-domain particles which are in the aggregate."
"Experiments that yield inversion of the Co59thin film nuclear system were carried out. For nanosecond magnetization reversal by a field with a growth rate greater than5 \\cdot 10^{11}Oe/s, 85% inversion was obtained. The investigation of the inverted state at frequencies corresponding to hexagonal (α) and f.c.c. (β) phases revealed that Co59-β switches 1.3 times faster than Co59-α. This is explained by the large contribution of rotational processes for Co59in β phase. Longitudinal relaxation time T1is measured by the method of pulse inversion."
  "Results are presented on observations of activeQswitching of the CO2laser by intracavity Stark modulation with a sine-wave or square-wave electric field using methyl chloride and 1-1 difluoroethane. PassiveQswitching of theRbranch of the 10.4-μm band by methyl fluoroform, at a repetition rate variable by a dc Stark field, is also reported."
"Optical pulses up to 1.25 Gbit/s were obtained with a Nd3+:YAG laser by multiple mode locking. The carrier frequency of mode-locked pulses was tuned through several tens of gigahertz by tilting an intracavity tuning etalon. Some detuning effects in forced mode locking will be also presented."
"A double-discharge hydrogen fluoride chemical laser using SF6+ C4H10and SF6+ H2is described. A maximum pulse energy of 102.5 mJ is reported, with a peak power of about 400 kW. The energy density is 300 mJ/l, and the electrical efficiency is 0.6 percent."
 "The amplification of a laser pulse has been evaluated numerically for three different laser media, viz., Nd-POCl3, Nd-glass, and ruby. An energy-utilization factor is defined and calculated for the same media. Finally, a dimensionless plot is given from which the amplification can be calculated for arbitrary numerical conditions."
"Extension of the molecular rate equations for a dye laser to include the effect of very rapid transverse flow shows that spatial transit times comparable to the dye intersystem crossing time prevent the buildup of a large triplet state population. This new technique enables limiting the triplet-triplet absorption loss without using triplet quenching agents. An air-turbine driven rotating disk of rhodamine 6G dye in polymethyl methacrylate is used to exchange the dye5 \\times 10^{6}times per second by 250-m/s transverse flow through the pump beam waist in an end-pumped near-spherical cavity (W_{0} \\sim 25 \\mu). In pulse experiments, transverse flow enabled increase of power output by a factor of 2.5 with a corresponding decrease in threshold power of about 30 percent. Thermal defocusing effects are eliminated at much slower flow rates. The ultrafast transverse-flow technique should also be applicable to liquid dye lasers and would be most important for cases where no effective triplet quenching agent can be found."
"A three-frequency 10.6-μm heterodyne receiver was demonstrated experimentally. Narrow-band reception of a 40-MHz IF was realized without tracking of the carrier frequency by the local oscillator laser. A signal-to-noise ratio within 1 dB of the theoretical value was measured for large SNR."

"A simple analytical model is presented to describe the delay τcbetween flashlamp initiation and laser-pulse onset in the flash-photolysis HF chemical laser. The predictions of the model agree well with experiments concerning the functional dependence of τcon pressure, flashlamp intensity, optical cavity loss, and the absolute magnitude of τc. This detailed agreement between theory and laser performance has not been achieved in previous chemical laser work. The pulse-delay measurements demonstrate the presence of complete vibrational inversion at the time of laser-pulse initiation. In the Appendixes, the fractional photodissociation of MoF6is calculated for the experimental geometry used, the effects of flashlamp heating are considered, and a general expression for the temperature dependence of HF laser gain is derived and plotted. A complete bibliography of laser transitions in HF and DF is included."
"A method for noninterference sampling of high-power CO2laser beams is described. The technique employs an ultrasonic diffraction grating generated in the air path across a laser beam. A very small fraction (\\sim10^{-7}) of the main beam is diffracted through a small angle (\\sim2\\deg) on either side. Profiles of Gaussian and \"donut\" modes from low-power CO2lasers were obtained with the acoustic beam splitter."
"The sensitivity of a broad-band dye laser to selective intracavity absorption is proportional to the number of oscillating modes. This result is obtained from a rate equation model, taking into account the spectral homogeneity, but spatial inhomogeneity of the laser saturation. An increase of absorption sensitivity by a factor of 105, compared to a single-pass measurement, is observed in an experiment with an iodine vapor absorption cell inside the cavity of a CW dye laser. The fluorescence of an external iodine vapor cell provides a convenient selective absorption monitor."
"The properties of the Nd-ultraphosphate NdP5O14(NdUP), a crystalline material that appears to be a promising candidate for an efficient Nd laser, are described. The Nd concentration of 4.1021/cm3is ∼60 times higher than the upper limit useful for doped laser crystals (\\simIpercent) like Nd:YAG. Despite the much higher Nd concentration the linewidths and cross sections of the major transitions are shown to be very similar to those of Nd:YAG. Therefore, it is expected that the gain per unit length in NdUP is also ∼60 times higher than in Nd:YAG. The crystal structure, the absorption and fluorescence spectra, level assignments, and various other features of NdUP are reported. Other rare earths form similar insoluble stable compounds. Most of them are transparent from the UV to the near IR except for the absorption bands of the metal ions."
"Data indicating the effects of an axial magnetic field on the output power of a pulsed xenon laser are presented. The output power increased significantly with increasing axial magnetic field only for low output power levels."
"This paper presents a theoretical treatment of the fluctuation mechanism involved in the generation of picosecond laser pulses with saturable absorbers. The processes responsible for the shortening of the pulsewidth and for selection of the most intense pulse are treated. Some experimental results that confirmed the treatment are presented. The influence of inertia of saturable absorber and nonlinear losses (self-focusing and self-modulation) is discussed."
"The propagation losses in metal-film-substrate two-dimensional optical waveguides are calculated. Losses for confined modes may become large and are at least an order of magnitude larger for TM than for TE modes. Higher order modes suffer more loss than the fundamental mode. Such mode-dependent loss can make efficient mode analyzers, useful for integrated optics modulation schemes."
"An experimental study of the saturable absorption of SF6at high pressure with high incident laser flux is reported. Experiments with a high-pulse-power CO2laser show 15 orders of magnitude change in transmittance of SF6(17 torr pressure) at theP(16) CO2line and apparent saturation of the residual absorption atP(20) andP(22) CO2wavelength. Comparison of these results with behavior predicted by a four-level model yields reasonable agreement over certain intensity ranges."
"The operation of a parametric oscillator phase matched in a GaAs thin-film waveguide is considered. Parametric equations of motion for interacting waveguide fields at three frequencies are developed. From these equations we derive expressions for parametric gain and oscillation threshold. A specific orientation of GaAs allows optically smooth cleaved surfaces to form the oscillator cavity. Conditions for which three waveguide modes at three different frequencies can be phase matched are presented for several specific waveguide-substrate structures. These conditions are in each case determined for a wide variety of mode orders, for a laser pump wavelength of 1.06 μ, and for a large range of signal wavelengths. The deviation in thin-film thickness that can be tolerated while maintaining phase matching over a given interaction length is calculated. We find that transverse coupling strength and oscillation threshold powers are widely variable for different phase matched mode order combinations. Oscillator frequency tuning is investigated by first deriving expressions for variations in waveguide parameters required to effect tuning over a specific range and then evaluating these expressions for some of the previously determined phase-matching situations."
"An interferometric technique was developed for detecting fast displacements of small areas in beam direction by less than\\lambda/8. It utilizes a modified Michelson interferometer and a He-Ne laser light source. The technique was applied to measure the temporal and spatial evolution of the thermal mirror deformation of a GaAs-Ga1-xAlxAs single heterostructure laser diode. A small spot on the facet of the laser diode formed one mirror of the interferometer. The other mirror was moved linearly with time by applying a ramp voltage to a piezoelectric transducer. The diode was pulsed during this motion. The local elongation of the laser diode was evaluated from the interferometer output signal. The measured elongation of the active region at a time 1 μs after a 150-ns pulse with current density 48 000 A/cm2was between 4 and 20 nm, indicating a temperature rise of2-11\\degC. The smallest elongations detected were in the range of 0.5-1 nm. The measured values are in substantial agreement with theoretical expectations from thermal model calculations."
"This correspondence describes a new technique for measuring temperature, inversion ratio, and the extent of pressure broadening in a CW molecular laser oscillator. All three quantities can be obtained from one set of measurements performed on the oscillator itself."
"Spectral and other properties of a ruby laser pumped LiIO3pulsed doubly resonant parametric oscillator (DRO) are reported. This device is tunable from 1.12 to 1.83 μ with peak powers of 100 kW and 10-percent efficiency. The stability of the DRO is discussed. The output of the DRO was doubled into the 5600- 9150-Å range using a second LiIO3crystal. Peak second-harmonic powers were 10-15 kW."
"This correspondence reports operation of an optical parametric oscillator pumped with a rhodamine 6G dye laser. Rapid tuning of the parametric oscillator is achieved by changing the dye wavelength. The spectrum from0.72-2.6 \\muwas scanned."
"Eleven fluorescing organic dyes were tested for their ability to alter the spectrum of a flashlamp in such a way as to increase the light intensity in one or more of the neodymium laser pump bands. A few of the dyes gave a marked improvement in the output energy of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Rhodamine 6G was identified as the best dye, giving better than 50 percent improvement in the laser output for 15-J 140-μs flashlamp pulses."
"Capacitive discharges in cesium vapor and rubidium vapor are used to realize externally controllableQswitches for synchronizing the appearance of pulse trains from passively mode-locked neodymium-glass and ruby lasers with other events occurring on a microsecond time scale."
"Intensity fluctuations of GaAs light-emitting diodes (LED) have been measured at 25°C ambient temperature in the frequency range of 25 Hz to 20 kHz. A dependence of optical fluctuations at low frequencies on diode current and also on the direction of emitted radiation has been found."

"We have investigated some of the properties of distributed-feedback (DFB) lasers made in active thin-film optical waveguides. By optically pumping these guides with spatially modulated light we have obtained narrow-line tunable oscillation. Operation in single-mode waveguides is well behaved and understood. Measurement of the oscillating wavelengths can be used to determine accurately the parameters that characterize the optical waveguide. This DFB measurement technique offers several advantages over the prism-coupler measurement technique for use with active films."
"Internal self-pulsing of commercially available GaAs lasers produces pulses as short as 100 ps. The simplicity and versatility of such devices make them very useful for fiber-dispersion studies. We describe pulse-transmission measurements in 178 m of a liquid-core fiber and explain the considerable pulse broadening (11 ns at the pulse base) in terms of mode delay and mode mixing."
"Attenuation and phase constants are calculated for a metal-clad-dielectric-slab waveguide and the results show the behavior of the propagating modes as a function of cladding material and dielectric. Analysis indicates that the dielectric properties influence the attenuation and cutoff frequencies whereas the metal cladding influences primarily the attenuation of propagating modes. Variation of the attenuation and phase constant around a center frequency show surface-wave properties of the TM0and TM1modes."
"The production of uniform large-volume laser plasmas with electron-ion densities on the order of 1012/cm3or larger by means of photoionization is investigated. An externally applied electric field heats the electron gas to the optimal temperature for excitation of laser levels. Photoionization by intense UV light may take place in a low partial pressure gas of low ionization potential species dispersed throughout the host laser medium, or the laser medium itself may serve as the photoionized species. Both single-photon ionization and two-photon two-step ionization are shown to be applicable."
"Hollow waveguide gas lasers of the type described by Smith have some inherent loss in coupling radiation from the guide into free space and back into the guide. This paper calculates that loss for the EH11lowest order waveguide mode as a function of mirror position and mirror radius. It is shown that some mirror positions and radii are optimum, in that they provide low coupling loss and are relatively insensitive to mirror position."
"Single pulses of 1-ns duration have been generated at 10.6-μ wavelength using a pulse-selection scheme in conjunction with an actively mode-locked CO2TEA oscillator. The experimental setup and its operating characteristics are presented. A technique is described, which yields pulse extinction ratios of approximately 900:1."
"Eighteen electrically pulsed parent compound-helium mixtures yielded N, C, Cl, or F atom lasing. The laser pulses appeared as one or more peaks at each wavelength. New lasing on the chlorine wavelength (3.5443 μmvac) was observed from a Cl2-He mixture."
"Mode delay and material dispersion limit the signal bandwidth of potential fiber communication systems. 200-ps pulses from a krypton laser, mode-locked at three different wavelengths, prove to be adequate for measuring both effects in relatively short fibers (33 m). The results are in good agreement with theory."
"It is shown theoretically that short intense light pulses of optical filaments can form an optical shock at the leading edge in the usual Kerr liquids. Under certain conditions an extremely sharp spike occurs at the front of the pulse."
"We describe a continuous tunable ultraviolet radiation source, operating in the spectral range 290-315 nm by intracavity frequency doubling of a rhodamine 6G dye laser. Maximum intracavity second-harmonic power of 1.1 mW was obtained at 296 nm with a bandwidth of 0.1 nm."

"The results are reported of some preliminary experiments on FM-CW range measurement using a CO2laser and a nitrogen-cooled PbSnTe detector. In clear conditions diffuse targets at ranges up to 10 km have been detected."
"The frequency fluctuations of a single-frequency laser due to mechanical vibrations are dependent on the sound pressure and sound frequency. The two dependences have been studied with the observation of beat signals between two stable external-mirror He-Ne lasers in the free-running condition. The dependence on the sound pressure follows Hooke's law, so that the difference between the frequency fluctuations due to the acoustic noises and those due to the external vibrations was quantitatively distinguished. Some causes of mechanical instability of the laser were clarified from the dependence on the sound frequency as compared with the lowest natural frequencies of each mechanical element in the cavity. The translation of mirrors along the optical cavity axis and two rotations of mirrors about the axis perpendicular to the optical cavity axis, which give rise to the variation in the relative angle between the laser beam axis and the Brewster window plate, are the most dominant motions that cause frequency fluctuations of the laser."
"A theoretical expression is obtained for the time dependence of the Stokes power output of a pulsed Raman laser, the pump pulse duration being comparable to the relaxation time of the Raman excitation and the output saturation limited. A rate-equation approach is employed, and the pump beam is assumed to have a Gaussian intensity distribution. The theory is developed in terms of the practical example, stimulated spin-flip Raman scattering in InSb."
"Based on previous work, a method is presented to predict the signature of a CO2laser, i.e., the output power as a function of the cavity length. For that purpose the normalized laser intensity curve versus cavity length is determined for a single line. The calculation is based on a homogeneously broadened line (Lorentzian shape) and takes into account the line dispersion. The curve is a parabola and its shape is assumed as being the same for all lines considered. From calculated positions of line centers and small-signal-gain data the signature can be drawn with the help of a parabolic French curve. The transition from one line to the next is assumed to occur at crossings of the normalized intensity curves. The theory agrees well with the experiment."
"The results of an experimental study to determine the spatial properties of unstable confocal resonator modes and their influence upon both the fractional output coupling and the far-field angular divergence are presented. The radial intensity distributions of the lowest order circulating mode within CO2unstable resonators and the corresponding near- and far-field patterns have been measured. The radial profiles exhibit a significantly nonuniform intensity distribution consistent with the results of recent theoretical analysis. The far-field intensity distribution as well as the fractional output coupling have been investigated for a number of unstable confocal resonator geometries. For modes contained within the uniform-gain region of the laser tube, the experimental results are in excellent agreement with Siegman's unstable resonator analysis."
"The use of shorter current pulses has enabled the time behavior of the xenon laser output pulses to be examined."

"A saturation model of stimulated Raman scattering, of general applicability, is put forward. The model is developed with reference to spin-flip electronic Raman scattering in InSb, where the number of excitations available for Raman scattering may be small by comparison with the incident photon numbers. A rate equation technique is used to evaluate the steady-state Stokes intensity and output powers for a Gaussian pump beam. The model is extended to take account of pump depletion and the relative importance of depletion, and saturation in limiting the conversion efficiency under different conditions is brought out. By comparison with continuous wave spin-flip measurements, values are obtained for the spin-relaxation time (τs) associated with spin reversal in InSb. For 1016free carriers per cubic centimeter at 36 kG,\\tau_{s} \\sim 12ns and for 1015cm-3at 16.9 kG,\\tau_{s} \\sim 1.3ns."
"Uncertainties in transition assignments for the neutral argon laser lines at 1.792 and 2.208 μm have been resolved by operation of a CW neutral argon laser with several simultaneous output wavelengths. The observed competition effects have established the correct transition for the 1.792-μm line to be3d(1/2)_{1}\\deg -4p(3/2)_{2}and for the 2.208-μm line to be3d(1/2)_{1}\\deg -4p'(3/2)_{2}."
"Variation of pH affects the quantum efficiency for photobleaching and the rate of aggregation following photobleaching. The adjustment of pH to minimize photobleaching is useful for rhodamine 6G and pyronon B, but not for disodium fluorescein. Some of the operational problems of dye lasers may be interpreted as aggregation effects."
"Dyes dissolved in viscous solvents can be pumped through simple nozzles to provide flowing thin streams of dye solution having excellent optical quality and stability over substantial areas. Such free flows, used in CW dye lasers instead of confined flows through thin cells, yield reduced lasing thresholds and superior long-term stability."
"Computer simulation results of a dye laser electronically tuned by an acoustooptic filter in the laser cavity are presented. The filter employs a nonlinear anisotropic crystal in which a colinear acoustic beam diffracts the light into the orthogonal polarization. Only a narrow wavelength band is constructively diffracted and since the band center is determined by the acoustic frequency, it is easily controlled electronically. The filter causes the frequency of the light to shift by twice the acoustic frequency in a round trip and so the usual laser resonance condition is not satisfied. The simulation indicates that the previously predicted steady-state results are attained under CW pumping conditions. With a representative CaMoO4fillter, approximately 3 μs are required to achieve the steady state and a 0.3 Å spectral bandwidth is typical. Similarly a LiNbO3filter requires 150 ns and produces a 0.17-Å spectral bandwidth. Results of simulation studies for pulsed operation are also included."
"Two infrared laser lines have been observed from electrically pulsed mixtures of OCS and helium. One is a new line from OCS and the other is a carbon atom line."
"Efficient extension of the tuning range of a1.09-1.95\\muparametric oscillator to0.435-0.975\\muby upconversion and doubling internally to the oscillator cavity is reported. Unlike previously studied external mixing, internal upconversion and doubling yielded uniform powers of 30 and 60 kW, respectively, over the entire extended tuning range with an unfocused 2-mm ruby laser pump beam of 750 kW."
"Submicrosecond pulses have been obtained from a photochemical H2-F2laser with a chemical efficiency of 0.5 percent. Energy densities of 6 J l-1were obtained from 60 torr (at 213 K) of a stoichiometric H2-F2mixture stabilized with 5 mole-percent O2. Laser output energy and the reciprocal of the pulsewidth were both proportional to the gas pressure. Actinometry showed that the laser energy output was 16.6 times the energy necessary to provide F atoms for initiation. Time-resolved spectra revealed excitation up to\\upsilon' = 6."
"The refractive indices of the ternaryA^{I}B^{III}C_{2}^{VI}semiconductors CuAlSe2, AgGaSe2, CuGaSe2, and AgInSe2have been measured over most of the transparency range of these crystals. The optical nonlinear coefficients for second-harmonic generation of AgGaSe2CuGaSe2, and AgInSe2have also been measured. Three-frequency colinear phase matching is analyzed in detail for AgGaSe2. The birefringences of the other three crystals are not sufficient to permit three-frequency colinear phase matching within the range of the measured index. The merits of AgGaSe2for nonlinear optical applications are evaluated in comparison with other promising infrared nonlinear materials."
"A previously developed theory of spontaneous emission from driven systems has been applied to the case of a Doppler broadened gas of two level atoms radiating into free space. The power spectrum of those photons radiated nearly parallel to the propagation vector of the driving field is predicted to differ from that of the undriven system. The case of zero attenuation coefficient (population equality in the two resonance levels) and the driving field tuned to the center of the Doppler line, is investigated in particular. When the saturation parameter is large there is strong suppression, in an interval about the central frequency comparable to the saturated width, of the spontaneous emission whose spectral components are phased for amplitude modulation relative to the driving field. An amount of power equal to that suppressed, but with spectral components phased for phase modulation relative to the driving field, is radiated in an interval about the central frequency comparable to the homogeneous width."
"A parametric investigation of high-voltage axially pulsed CO2lasers was performed. The parametric variables were tube diameter, discharge voltage, discharge capacitance, and gas mixture. The output energy per unit discharge length increased linearly with tube diameter for laser bores greater than 5 cm. Volumetric scaling was obtained with 2.5-cm and 5-cm bore lasers. A maximum energy density of 4.8 mJ/cm3was obtained in the 2.5-cm bore laser at a total pressure of 90 torr. A maximum energy per pulse of 287 J was obtained with a 15-cm-bore 10-m-long laser. For all lasers and gas conditions the output energy increased as the applied voltage was increased until an arc discharge occurred. At maximum output energy the ratio of applied electric field-to-total gas pressure was approximately 15 V/cm-torr. The optimum energy-storage capacitance increased with tube diameter."
"A number of gases are reported that extend the range of CO2laser lines able to be modulated by means of the molecular Stark effect. Data are presented on external modulation of the00\\deg1-10\\deg0band in theRbranch by methyl fluoroform and in thePbranch by 1-1 difluoroethane. The gases fluoroethane, mono-methylamine, and methyl mercaptan and the vapors methanol and trichloroethylene are reported to modulate lines in thePbranch of the00\\deg1-02\\deg0band."
"An experimental investigation of a 60-cm-wide × 2.5-cm-high N2-CO2cross-beam electric-discharge convection laser (EDCL) is described. In the cross-beam EDCL, the discharge is maintained along the flow in a rectangular cross-section channel and optical power is extracted transverse to the discharge and flow. High mass flow rates are employed to achieve high volumetric power densities. Experiments relating to the achievement of uniform and stable discharges at high-power levels in the rectangular laser channel, and measurements of the small-signal gain characteristics, amplifier performance, and optical quality are described. Using an 11-pass optical scheme, a CW optical output power of 2 kW has been extracted from the amplifier at an electrical efficiency of 9.6 percent."
"Two electrode designs are described that are capable of producing high output energy densities from pulsed atmospheric pressure CO2-N2-He lasers. In both cases a uniform volumetric excitation is obtained by the use of an auxiliary discharge. The first system uses a mesh cathode and has produced 4.8 J from an excited volume of 800 cm3(6 J.1-1). The second system uses a solid cathode and has produced 2 J from an excited volume of 110 cm3(18 J.1-1). Results of a parametric study of the solid cathode system are given. The output pulse energy, peak power, and pulse shape have been studied as functions of the energy-storage capacitor value, charging voltage, and gas composition. Partial self-mode-locking and the effect of single-mode operation on the pulsewidth have been observed."
"Some characteristics of CO laser operation are reported. A discussion of the roles of the various ingredients necessary for optimization of the gas compositions is given and measurements of efficiency, spectral output, small signal gains, and saturation intensity at various temperatures are reported. Important mechanisms that dominate the kinetics of the molecules and electrons in electrical discharge systems are described briefly. Several experimental observations are presented to support the interpretations and conclusions that have been drawn regarding the pumping processes and optimum operating characteristics. The possibility of high-power operation of the CO laser with high efficiency is demonstrated by the attainment of laser efficiencies up to 47 percent with small signal gain coefficients of nearly 0.5 percent/cm and a saturation intensity of 15 W/cm2at a gas temperature of 200°K."
"We report operation of a pulsed combustion-heated gas dynamic CO2laser. The pulsed version is compared with the continuous gas dynamic laser. Variation of the pulse energy with the stagnation pressure of the gas, the shape of the expansion nozzle, and output mirror transmittance is discussed. Observed laser pulse energy of 110 J is compared with theoretical estimates of maximum obtainable energy."
"Results obtained to date with TEA CO2lasers in both single-pulse and high-repetition-rate operation are described. The special cathode arrangement for triggered discharge permits output energy of more than 18 J/1 of excited volume, with overall efficiency of 17 percent without arcing. Preliminary results obtained with a gas recirculating loop are 100 pulses/s at a 20-J/pulse level."
"Possible reasons for narrow-band oscillation of phosphate glass and inorganic liquid lasers with neodymium are described. It is shown that experimental data considered earlier to be evidence of fast energy-transfer rate can alternatively be explained if the degree of spectral line inhomogeneity is about unity. Neodymium stimulated-emission cross sections in phosphate glasses are compared at room and low temperatures. The results of the comparison suggest that the degree of spectral line inhomogeneity is small."
"In order for optical transmission systems to compete successfully with other techniques, the circuits must be comparably small, comparably rugged, and comparably priced. The avenue to achieving these characteristics is via miniature guided-wave structures in contrast to beam-mode propagation via lenses and mirrors. Passive miniature transmission lines with satisfactory losses have been formed in glass and fused silica using ion bombardment and reactive sputtering. Certain crystalline systems seem well adapted to thin-film non-linear interactions at low absolute-power levels. Nonlinear liquids in hollow glass fibers can be used to achieve interaction lengths of a meter or more with the field concentrated to a few wavelengths width in the transverse direction. Photolithographic techniques based on visible or ultraviolet exposure of the photoresist yield waveguide-edge roughness greater than that needed for optical circuitry. However, electron beam exposure of the photoresist seems capable of yielding satisfactory results."
"Wave propagation in optical waveguides on substrates of magnetic, optically active, or birefringent material is analyzed. The conditions for TE\\LeftrightarrowTM mode conversion are derived and computer calculations showing the characteristic of a quartz-substrate mode converter is obtained. A mathematical analysis of a gyrator using two mode converters in series is given and the schemes for an isolator, modulator, optical switch, and optical read-out devices are mentioned."
"Low-loss glass fibers are a prospective transmission medium for optical communication systems. To study their dispersion characteristics, we investigated the propagation of short optical pulses in up to 10 m of cladded fiber. The pulses, 7 ps long and 6 THz in spectral width, were derived from a mode-locked Nd:glass laser by frequency doubling (0.53-μm wavelength). We measured the broadened pulses emerging from the fiber by a sampling technique that employed an optical Kerr shutter of 10 ps gating time. The fiber had a core diameter of 11 μm and an index difference of 1 percent between core and cladding. The loss was about 1.8 dB/m. Our measurements showed satisfactory agreement with a theory that takes material dispersion and mode dispersion into account and assumes strong attenuation of the high-order modes in the particular fiber tested. At the end of 10 m, the 7-ps pulse reached a width of 110 ps, haft of which can be accounted for by material dispersion. When we extrapolate these results to practical systems, we conclude that pulses from a light-emitting diode transmitted through a fiber with the above design would broaden by at least 2.6 ns/km (because of material dispersion), and possibly by as much as 33 ns/km, if all modes were excited and reached the detector with comparable attenuation and negligible coupling."
"Pulsed laser action has been obtained in neutral xenon in the infrared at a repetition rate of 1.4 kHz by using a transversely excited helium-xenon discharge. This high PRF was made possible by the use of a transverse gas flow to remove the residual ions from the discharge region. We have been able to obtain 5.2 W of average power from an 80-cm-long closed-cycle device in which the flow velocity is 30 m/s. The xenon pressure is 0.1-1 torr, which is 10-100 times greater than that for CW xenon lasers. Pulses of 104W peak power and 0.5 μs duration are obtained with spectral components at 2.027, 3.508, and 3.652 μ."
"An in-line eight-stage digital light deflector is described. The polarization switch is similar to a birefringence-compensated transverse modular, which has a practical angular aperture of 10°. The birefringent elements are single prisms."
"The use of cadmium telluride as an electrooptic material for intracavity modulation of CO2lasers is described. Included are the predicted and measured effects of CdTe intracavity modulators on laser performance. Coupling and frequency modulation are discussed and experimental results compared with theoretically predicted performance for both techniques. Limitations on the frequency response of the two types of modulation are determined."
"The properties of Nd3+: POCl3-ZrCl4and SnCl4liquid lasers were investigated. Stimulated-emission cross section, loss coefficient, and terminal-level lifetime were determined. Thermal effect and amplification characteristics were studied. According to the experimental data, the POCl3liquid laser seems to be useful for a high-power laser system under suitable arrangements."
"A comparison of threshold and slope efficiency is made for 2-μm laser action in Ho3+-doped YLF and YAG hosts at room temperature. Spectroscopic and laser properties of these materials are also discussed."
"The feasibility of a 3 by 3 (nine-element) coherent receiver array operating at 10.6 μm with 1.5-GHz instantaneous IF bandwidth and near theoretical quantum-noise limited operation has been demonstrated. An analysis of the complex amplitudes of received signal and local oscillator was performed to yield high signal conversion efficiences and controlled optical beam crossovers. Experimental results are presented that include mixer frequency response, mixer sensitivity, and far-field \"receiving antenna\" patterns for the array showing -3-dB optical crossovers between adjacent array elements. It is concluded that infrared heterodyne arrays provide a multiplicity of coherent resolution elements analogous to multifeed microwave antennas."
"The design of a high-sensitivity wide-bandwidth 10.6-μm heterodyne receiver has been established for space and ground operational use, and key elements for a satellite-to-earth communications link were demonstrated. The receiver includes a cooled HgCdTe infrared mixer diode, a conical scanner for spatial tracking, an acquisition channel for spatial search and station alignment, and an automatic frequency-control channel to maintain a fixed laser frequency offset. The infrared mixer is designed to provide nearly quantum-noise-limited operation over an extended range of mixer temperature, bias voltage, and IF. The resultant experimental receiver has a measured noise equivalent power of less than 10-19W/Hz over the 15- to 40-MHz IF band for mixer temperatures from 85 to 115 K, and less than2 \\times 10^{-19}W/Hz up to 140 K. Mixer 3-dB cutoff frequencies as high as 420 MHz were measured at a mixer temperature of 125 K. An analysis and engineering equations are given for receiver noise components, noise equivalent power, available mixer conversion gain, mixer transducer gain, and quantum-noise factor in terms of such factors as mixer parameters, quantum efficiency, mixer temperature, dynamic conductance, bias voltage, LO power, and IF amplifier characteristics."
"The self-focusing of a beam with Gaussian intensity profile is examined for dependence on sample length, beam diameter, and beam divergence or convergence. The results indicate that amplifiers forQ-switched pulses can be designed to avoid significant self-focusing effects."
"A continuous TEM00power of more than\\frac{1}{2}W has been obtained from a single-longitudinal-mode (SLM) Nd:YAG laser pumped with a 1-kW tungsten-iodine lamp. Spatial hole burning, the cause of multilongitudinal mode (MLM) oscillation, was eliminated by placing the rod between two quarter-wave plates. The resulting laser mode had a spatially uniform light intensity along the axis of the laser rod. The linearly polarized SLM power was 78 percent of the polarized MLM output and 62 percent of the total unpolarized TEM00power available from the laser. The power reductions were due only to threshold insertion losses. The combination of simplicity and high efficiency has not been found in other SLM techniques for solid ion lasers."
"High-quality laser processing for industrial production requires, in addition to a suitable beam source, an appropriate adaption of the laser emission to the processing material. Therefore the interaction of the high-intensity laser beam with solid transparent matter was investigated. The kinetics of heating and evaporation by laser pulses was studied. The experiments showed that transparent materials can be vaporized by laser light in spite of their small absorption. The first initial spike (peak intensity\\sim10^{8}W/cm2) turns the absorption coefficient of a surface layer in a very short time (\\sim10^{-7}s) from 10-2to 103cm-1. The further emission is absorbed completely in the heated layer and vaporizes the material at an approximately constant rate. A model explaining the heating of transparent materials by laser beams is demonstrated and accounts for the experimental observations. The shape of the resulting holes is discussed."
"Propagating modes of a dielectric-slab waveguide consisting of a dielectric core and metal clads are analyzed numerically by using a simplified model. The behavior of modes is graphically shown and their peculiarities due to dielectric properties of metal are described. It is shown that the TE0mode has the smallest attenuation constant when the wavelength is sufficiently short and that the TM0mode changes continuously to the TEM mode of a parallel-plate waveguide in the submillimeter region, but it has generally a very high attenuation at an optical wavelength."
"The frequency separation between adjacent longitudinal modes in semiconductor lasers varies from mode to mode over the laser spectrum because of the effects of dispersion in the laser medium. Because of the interest in mode locking and self-pulsing of GaAs lasers it is desirable to know the magnitude of this effect. We have measured this variation of mode separation by measuring the correlation function of the field amplitude in the output beam of an oscillating, diffused junction, stripe geometry GaAs laser operating CW at\\sim80\\degK. The correlation function is measured with a Michelson interferometer and is facilitated by using a diode that simultaneously oscillates in two widely separated families of longitudinal modes. The significance of this measurement to mode locking and self-pulsing in GaAs lasers is discussed."
"The linear and circular birefringent properties of low-loss single-mode glass fibers are found to depend upon length. Depolarization is about 1 percent/km. Some anomalous behavior can be explained in terms of properties varying locally along the fiber and a resultant upper information rate of over 1012bits/s is estimated. Very small stress distributions or core ellipticities could give rise to the observed effects."
"The conversion of a Gaussian laser beam into higher order optical beam modes through acoustooptical modulation is treated. In particular the effects of this conversion in an optical communications system are described with emphasis placed on the actual signal received by a distant antenna rather than on the total power scattered. For the special case of pulse amplitude modulation, which is considered in detail, the received optical signal displays phase modulation as well as the impressed amplitude modulation. The relative importance of the two effects depends strongly on the location of the receiving aperture in the far field of the transmitted beam. An experiment in which 10.6-μ, laser light is scattered by a germanium acoustooptical modulator is described. The results of the experiment compare well with the predictions of the above analysis."
"The coupled-mode equations are solved for homogeneously broadened lasers modulated near the axial mode separation frequency. The character of the oscillations changes rapidly when the modulation period is tuned through the round-trip delay at the group velocity. Specifically, this is the region in which phase modulation leads to pulsing and loss modulation leads to pulsing at normal power. The present method agrees with the results of Kuizenga and Siegman for this region, but gives a countable set of supermodes in addition. There is some reason to believe that these other modes have already been observed. When the group velocity condition is not satisfied, a more complete description is given than has been previously reported. Most importantly, the dependence of laser power on modulator drive and frequency can be predicted."
"A single time-scale model is developed to describe the 10.6-μ laser energy extraction from an initially inverted N2-CO2catalyst mixture where the energy is stored primarily in the N2vibration. This condition is typical of high-pressure gas dynamic lasers, but the methods are general and applicable to other systems. In the absence of external pumping, the nitrogen can be regarded as an energy source that is depleted on a time scale\\tau = \\tauNAT(1 + I_{0}/I), \\tauNATbeing the minimum possible time scale governed by collisional processes, τ determines the pulse time forQ-switched laser mixtures or the required streamwise cavity length for CW gas dynamic lasers. The derived saturation intensity I0also appears in the expression for saturated gain (for collision broadened cases)g = g_{0}/(1 + I/I_{0}), where g0is approximately the small signal gain at a given nitrogen vibrational temperature, g0decays on the same intensity-dependent time scale τ as the nitrogen vibrational energy."
"Candidate wide-bandwidth (1-Gbit/s) satellite laser communications systems are compared on two different bases. First, a comparison is made with projected component technology to establish relative performance between the various approaches based on the fundamental system parameters. From this comparison it appears that the CO2(10.6-μm) system offers a signal-to-noise advantage over the Nd:YAG (1.06-μm) or doubled Nd:YAG (0.53- μm) system for a comparable satellite burden. Second, a comparison is made based upon the concept that launch cost for equivalent systems comprises an optimizing criterion. From this comparison it appears that the launch costs for the CO2and doubled Nd:YAG systems can be similar, but the latter is very sensitive to the projected weight of a large lightweight \"photon bucket\" receiving aperture. In general, the relative deficiency in signal-to-noise ratio for the Nd:YAG system can only be accommodated through adoption of an open-loop pointing system with an accuracy of 1 μrad or less, as compared to a closed-loop pointing system with relaxed accuracy for the CO2system. The most critical technology problem for the CO2system is that of Doppler compensation. These and other critical technologies for both approaches are listed and discussed."
"It is shown that in the absence of relaxation or inhomogeneous broadening the steady-state π pulse in an amplifier is locally unstable against the introduction of certain amplitude perturbations."
"Presents the table of contents for this issue of this periodical."
"Experiments performed over the past year have involved the use of near-diffraction-limited lasers at power levels up to 20 kW for welding applications. This is a substantially higher power level than used in all previously reported experiments. As a result of the higher powers, significantly deeper penetration has been achieved. The optical cavity for the lasers used in these tests was an unstable oscillator, producing a near-diffraction-limited output with an obscuration of approximately 50 percent. The measured penetration for these tests is in reasonably good agreement with established correlations for vacuum electron beam welding data, indicating a strong similarity between the two types of welding. It is shown that a power of 2-4 kW is needed to produce thermally efficient welds in low-thermal-diffusivity plate materials such as 1/2-in stainless steel, and that higher powers are needed for the more highly conducting metals."
"The most efficient lamp-pumped laser yet reported has been obtained from the 2.1-μm transition of Ho3+in Er3+-Tm3+sensitized YAG at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Multimode CW output of 20 W, efficiencies up to 4 percent, and 5-W TEM00at 1 percent resulted when tungsten-iodine pump lamps were utilized."
"Using departure from stoichiometry, p-n junctions were prepared in CdxHg1-xTe withx \\simeq 0.20for the study of photovoltaic detection at 10.6 μ. In the final photodiodes, with sensitive areas between4 \\times 10^{-4}and 10-3cm2, values such as10^{5} \\Omegaand 8 pF have been observed at -0.1 V reverse bias for the shunt resistance and capacitance at 77°K. The CO2laser detection characteristics were investigated, leading to 1010< D*(10.6 μ, 1800 Hz, 1 Hz)\\leq 5 \\times 10^{10}cm W-1Hz1/2, a frequency response flat up to 1 GHz, a heterodyne noise equivalent power (NEP) =8 \\times 10^{-20}W/Hz with l-mW local oscillator power. Studies as a function of the temperature indicated that substantial sensitivity can be obtained up to 135°K."
"Observations are reported of the differences in the damage properties of crystalline quartz for ruby laser pulses having different mode structures. The damage threshold values for the multimode laser are found to depend on the propagation and polarization directions of the incident laser pulse. The threshold values for the TEM00laser are independent of propagation and polarization directions. The damage patterns produced when either of the two lasers is focused within the sample show a distinct characteristic dependence on the laser propagation direction within the crystal. A phenomenological model is developed to explain the differences in the damaged properties produced by the two lasers."
"A pulsed electric N2/CO2laser is used to investigate the power extraction capabilities of stable and unstable cavity resonators. Under conditions of the same resonator output coupling and coverage of the laser mediums no appreciable difference in power extraction is measured between the stable and unstable resonators. When focused, the unstable resonator produced focal point power densities measured to be within 60-90 percent of that calculated for an ideal diffraction-limited spot."
"Material removal from the front surface of a solid by a high-intensity laser beam is analytically treated. The model used allows for transmission of laser energy past the front surface and for transient phenomena. It is found that for certain laser and material parameters subsurface temperatures will exceed the surface temperature. Under such conditions, explosive removal of material could occur resulting in very rapid and efficient material removal. These predictions are compared to previously published experimental results."
"It is found that under appropriate conditions the high-gain 3.51-μ xenon laser may exhibit relaxation oscillations in the frequency range of 1 to 10 MHz. Experimental investigations have been conducted in both the time and frequency domains. Most of the observed features of these fluctuations are in good agreement with theoretical considerations."
"An N2laser pumped dye-laser system is described which uses an oscillator-amplifier arrangement and fast-flow dye cells in order to achieve spectral narrowing and spatial coherence without sacrificing power."
"A laser pattern generation system has been developed to define gold conductor patterns on ceramic substrates. Such patterns are used as interconnection circuitry for silicon integrated circuits. The system consists of a mechanical positioning device for the substrates, a numerical control system, and an Nd:YAG laser to evaporate the gold selectively to form the desired pattern. Rotational motion is used to position the substrates in order to achieve high pattern generation rates. The positioning system uses a drum around whose periphery are mounted the substrates. Associated with each substrate is a code plate, which chops an auxiliary laser beam to provide timing signals to the control system. The substrates are rotated at constant speed past a lens assembly, which is advanced by one address unit in the orthogonal direction after each revolution to produce a sequential scan of the substrates. The laser acoustoopticQswitch is operated in synchronism with the timing pulses from the moving code plate, and patterns are written by use of an extracavity acousto-optic lead molybdate deflector synchronized to theQswitch. The energy source is a krypton-pumped Nd:YAG laser. In order to machine at a rate of 17 s/cm2of substrate the laser isQswitched at 25 kHz. Laser mode control and stability were found to be decisive parameters to obtain uniform patterns. Output in the TEM00mode was found to be necessary. Suitable patterns may be made with a 4.9-W TEM00output. The system has a 14-μm resolution. Test patterns that demonstrate the feasibility of laser pattern generation at economical rates are shown."
"FM-CW radar range measurement by a CO2laser is reported. Nonlinear variation of the laser power output is obtained when the reflected signal is mixed within the laser cavity. This variation is attributed to frequency pulling/pushing and to power-dependent refractive index changes in the laser medium."
"The output center wavelength of a rhodamine 6G dye laser was tuned by using variable birefringence filters in the cavity. The electrooptic properties of two different lead lanthanum zirconate titanate (PLZT) ceramics were used in these filters to achieve up to 120 Å of wavelength tuning. Spectral bandwidths varied from 20 to 120 Å with these particular filters."
"High-power pulses of ultraviolet light of wavelength 266 nm have been produced by frequency doubling the 1064-nm wavelength of Nd:YAG to 532 nm using lithium iodate and frequency doubling this green light to 266 nm by using ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP). A peak power of 310 W at 266 nm was obtained in a single Gaussian transverse mode representing a 54 percent peak conversion of incident 532-nm light. At a repetition rate of 1 kHz the average UV power is about 35 mW. The pulses are approximately triangular with a pulse width of 250 ns. This is a new source of high-power high repetition-rate coherent ultraviolet light."
"The dependence of spectral narrowing in lasers on the line-broadening mechanism is investigated including the effects of saturation and distributed loss. It is found that in the unsaturated regime the narrowing is essentially independent of the resonance broadening mechanism and the narrowed line approaches a Gaussian. The onset of saturation slows or reverses the narrowing process. Experimental results have been obtained using a 3.51-μ xenon laser."
"The peak power output of flashlamp-pumped dye-doped polymethylmethacrylate laser rods can be increased through the use of \"light converters.\" This general technique provides a means of increasing the flashlamp pumping efficiency of organic dyes."
"A model has been developed that uses a continuous, distributed, and moving heat source to describe the temperature profile and thermal stress propagation for laser drilled holes in high-purity fired-alumina ceramic substrate material. The temperature profile and the tangential stress distribution of the laser-formed hole are calculated to indicate the magnitude of those factors that can influence the potential fracture of the alumina material. These factors are of interest in order to help establish optimum laser-drilling parameters. Experimental data are obtained from the ruby and CO2lasers operated in the pulsed mode. The experimental results are found to be in excellent agreement with the theoretical analysis."
"Measurements were made of the time-dependent gain in flashlamp-pumped rhodamine 6G/ethanol solutions saturated with air and with nitrogen. Fitting of transient gain data to theory showed that dissolved oxygen increased the rate of triplet generation as well as accelerating the return of triplets to the ground state. Large transient absorption was observed in fluorescein solution at all oxygen concentrations but it was removed by adding anthracene or cyclooctatetraene."
"Optical pumping of solid-state lasers induces thermal lensing in the laser crystal. This lansing determines the beam properties in the resonator; the TEM00-mode radiation is limited to a small laser rod volume and it depends on the pump power. Especially with pulse-pumped systems, the generation of stable fundamental mode radiation could only be obtained with low efficiency. Laser resonators with optimum TEM00mode output were studied considering the thermal lensing. A kind of resonator was found, the radiation of which is insensitive to thermal distortions. The following is determined by parametersg_{1}, g_{2}:\\frac{1}{g_{1}}=2g_{2} +^{1} (\\frac{a}{b})^{2} + 2\\frac{a}{b}, whereaandbare distances between rod ends and mirrors,aandbbeing the distances between the two mirrors and the lens. The predicted beam behavior was verified experimentally with a high repetition rate YAG laser. A high-precision laser drilling machine was constructed with this design. Because of the insensitive properties, reproducible material processing was achieved in industrial use."
"Presents the back cover of the periodical issue."
"An analysis of the mode frequencies and phases of lasers that are self-pulsing due to second-order mode locking is presented. It is shown that locking can occur with the modes arranged in several different configurations with different pulsing frequencies corresponding to the beat notes between different combinations of longitudinal modes. The experimental observations of the transition between two of these configurations in a self-pulsing GaAs junction laser is reported."
 "The apparent omission of a necessary frequency-energy normalization term in the above paper is discussed."
"The theory of a multimode ring-laser gyro with intracavity phase modulation is developed, starting from the wave equation for a rotating reference frame. The approach is to extract physical information without actually solving the equations. Considering each of the oppositely directed traveling waves (ODTW) separately, the behavior is similar to that of an ordinary two-mirror phase-modulated laser. However, when the waves are heterodyned to measure a beat frequency, small mode-pulling effects become important, and, if the ODTW are treated unequally by the system, a frequency error or offset results. Sources of offset include time variation of the modulator length, reactance of the gain medium, and detuning of the modulator frequency from axial mode spacing. When back reflections are included in the theory, the results reduce to the single-mode ring-laser case, with the coupling coefficient dependent upon overlap between the ODTW at the reflector. It is predicted that at low rotation rates the ODTW frequencies will still become locked together, except in a very special case where the lock-in threshold vanishes. Significance of the nature of the reflecting elements is discussed. Comments are made on the predicted merits of phase modulation as an improvement in the low-rotation-rate measuring capabilities of the device."
"Experimental results are presented on the performance of CW krypton arc lamps operated at power levels up to 20 kW. These lamps are suitable for pumping of high-powered Nd:YAG lasers. Operating life and electrical and spectral characteristics of the lamps were tested as a function of arc length, bore size, and fill pressure."
"The noise present in the detected optical output of three types of small-area electroluminescent diodes (GaAs diffused junctions (Al-Ga)As single and double heterostructures), operated continuously at high-current densities in a room-temperature ambient, has been measured in the frequency range of 300 Hz to 300 kHz. The best unit showed noise, with an1/f-type frequency dependence, which was less than twice the theoretical detector shot-noise limit at 350 Hz and that approached this shot-noise limit near 1.2 kHz."
"The output of lasers in various modes of operation is described in a unified way, using Fourier analysis. A novel model for treating an active Fabry-Perot cavity, including the case of high gain, is developed resulting in a more exact expression for the spectral width of the cavity modes. Simple mathematical tools are given to relate the observed pulse length with the average gain and with the initial population inversion in the laser medium. It is shown that lasers with homogeneously broadened spectral lines have cavity modes of equal width and that if the modes are locked together the resulting ultrashort pulses are of equal duration. For lasers with inhomogeneously broadened spectral lines the cavity modes vary in width along the gain curve and, when mode-locked, the ultrashort pulses increase monotonically in duration along the emitted pulse train."
"It is pointed out that responsivity can be improved by mechanical resonances. The enhancement factor of responsivity of a trigricyne sulphate (TGS) pyroelectric detector is measured as 40 ∼ 50 at the mechanical resonances whose modes are assigned to dilational modes of a rectangular-plate vibrator. Also, a pyroultrasonic parametric amplifier is demonstrated, which can show further improvement of responsivity of the pyroelectric detector by amplifying the strain that accompanies pyroelectricity. Gain and an equivalent circuit are derived using a simplified parametrically coupled multimode vibrator model. A pyroultrasonic parametric amplifier using lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramic is demonstrated, and an improvement of about 5 dB is shown. Obtaining the gain stability is one of the serious problems of a pyroultrasonic parametric amplifier."
"Experimental results are presented for the multimode ring-laser gyro with intracavity phase modulation. By proper choice of modulator frequency, the oppositely directed traveling waves (ODTW) exist as either pulse trains or FM signals. Conditions have been achieved, depending upon the time at which pulses arrive at the modulator, in which lock in between ODTW does not occur at low rotation rates. This result is not adequately explained, but is clearly useful for rotation sensing. In this condition, rotation sensitivity is noise limited and shows an improvement of two orders of magnitude over the same system without modulation. When lock in does occur, it is accompanied by a hysteresis effect that is explained in terms of an optical damage effect in the KDP modulator crystal. In the FM region of operation, the beat frequency between ODTW contains an offset that drifts with time and so this region of operation is not as useful for rotation sensing as is the pulse-train region."
"Measurements of total emitted parametric fluorescence power are presented and used to fix one point on the predicted tuning curve of a parametric oscillator. The method is particularly useful for predicting the tuning curve of infrared pumped parametric oscillators. Experimental results, which verify the usefulness of the technique in a 1.06-μ-pumped oscillator, are presented."
"Degradation rates of double-heterostructure GaAs lasers have been measured and found to vary superlinearly with the injected current density above threshold. The results are discussed in the context of the Gold-Weisberg phonon-kick and the extended Longini field-inhibited diffusion degradation mechanisms."
"A uniform plane-wave theory of the type previously employed for the optical parametric oscillator (OPO) is extended to include internal upconversion and frequency doubling. All the experimental configurations for internal upconversion and doubling in the three basic OPO types are treated. Generated intensities are calculated for representative system parameters, and both design parameters and quantum upconversion and doubling efficiencies are obtained for optimum operation in each configuration. The position of the upconverter in the OPO cavity relative to the oscillator crystal and input-pump direction is shown to affect efficiency and output characteristics drastically. The detrimental effects of internal up-conversion on threshold are shown to be an important design consideration. Applicability of the results to pulsed OPO internal upconversion and frequency doubling is determined, and design criteria for selecting the best mode of operation are discussed."
"The possibilities for nonlinear optics in proustite have been explored in a wavelength region previously indicated as having low absorption. We used a 10-W CW CO2laser oscillating on a single transition at 9.2-μ wavelength. The observed values for nonlinearity and absorption are, respectivley,(7.9 \\pm 2.0) \\times 10^{-23}in MKS units and 0.29 cm-1."
"Q-switched laser-damage thresholds have been determined for six materials (proustite-Ag3AsS3, pyrargyrite-Ag3SbS3, cinnabar-HgS, silver thiogallate-AgGaS2, tellurium-Te, and gallium arsenide-GaAs) of interest for nonlinear optics in the medium infrared. Four TEM00mode lasers were employed with outputs at wavelengths of 694 nm, 1.06, 2.098, and 10.6 μm. Damage has been found to be confined to the surface of the crystals and occurs for radiation intensities between 3 and 75 MW/cm2. Particular care is needed in the cutting and polishing of tellurium crystals if a high-damage threshold is to be achieved."
"An analysis is given of folded 3-mirror laser resonators with an internal cell set at Brewster's angle. A method is described to compensate the astigmatic distortions introduced by both the internal mirror and the cell. This compensation is achieved for a specific relation between cell thickness and folding angle. It allows the formation of a tight intracavity focus as required in applications such as CW dye lasers. A discussion is given of the mode characteristics of compensated cavities and of the limitation on beam concentration set by the thickness of the Brewster cell."
"An output power of 1 W is reported from a tunable CW dye laser pumped by 3.5 W of argon laser radiation. The nearly 30 percent conversion efficiency is achieved by using a very low-loss folded 3-mirror cavity and by pumping through a Brewster-angle dispersing prism."
"Multimode optical fibers consisting of glass cladding and liquid core have been constructed. For a cladding index of refraction of 1.52 and a core of bromobenzene, index of 1.560, a loss of 0.140 dB/m has been measured over lengths of about 50 m. The loss measured with incoherent light is higher due to the presence of higher order modes. Strong absorption in the near infrared occurs in narrow wavebands associated with overtones of the C-H fundamental vibration frequency."
"Single picosecond light pulses from a mode-locked Nd:glass laser are investigated by several methods. Their temporal structure is studied by two-photon fluorescence. The frequency spectra are measured quantitatively. The energy distribution is simultaneously investigated by three-photon fluorescence, photoelectric measurements, and quantitative studies of the contrast ratio of the two-photon fluorescence. The pulse shape is measured using a method based on the stimulated Raman effect. It is observed that the pulses are weakly asymmetric-the pulse decay is slower (exponential) than the pulse rise (Gaussian). Bandwidth-limited pulses of 4-8 ps are present in the leading part of the pulse train. Substantial frequency broadening develops as the pulse train reaches its maximum and a subpicosecond structure is formed in the trailing part of the pulse train."
 "It is well known that there are two possible phase positions for the pulse in a mode-locked laser with an internal phase modulator. By using a modulator cut in the form of a Brewster angle prism, it becomes possible to operate an Nd:YAG laser stably in either position at will. The angular beam deflection is slightly different for the two modes and, hence, by mirror adjustment one mode or the other can be selected. A simple analysis is presented to estimate the magnitude of this effect in rough agreement with experimental observations."
"Previous steady-state plane-wave theory for the singly resonant parametric oscillator has been extended to the case of arbitrary mirror reflectivities using the exact solutions given by Armstrong et al. [3] for the parametric interaction of three traveling waves. Numerical results are obtained for the efficiency, pump power transmission, optimum output coupling, threshold for the second mode, etc., for parametric oscillators with arbitrary mirror reflectivities and operating under arbitrary power levels. The analysis is also applied to the intracavity-coupled parametric oscillator-upconverter."
"This paper discusses the probabilistic nature of the damaging interaction between light and matter. It is shown that when one recognizes that there is some probability to induce damage at any level of optical irradiation, then the reported irreproducible damage-resistance properties of many useful materials can be understood. This point of view also explains why some optical components may be safely irradiated many times before damage occurs, though no other change in the material can be detected prior to the observation of damage. Experimental data showing the probability for surface damage as a function of power density are presented for several materials. The dependence of damage probability on optical field strength is similar to that of the dc ionization coefficients for semiconductors and gases on the applied field. This observation is discussed and it is suggested that a form of avalanche breakdown might be the cause of laser-induced damage."

"The form and the decay time of the intensity correlation function of the light from a single-mode He:Ne laser have been measured in the neighborhood of threshold. The experiments were performed at several predetermined values of the pump parametera, ranging froma = -1toa = 4. By combination of the experimental results with the theoretically predicted eigenvalues appearing in the expansion of the correlation function, it was possible also to determine the amplitudes of the first two terms in the expansion over the same range. The experimental results are found to be substantially in agreement with the nonlinear oscillator theory of the laser, without adjustment of any arbitrary scaling parameters."

"An electrically excited CO2-N2laser has been developed using high repetition rate discharge pulses from a pin electrode array transverse to a supersonic flow. To date volumetric laser power density of 34 W/cm3from a Mach 3 flow at 17-kHz repetition rate and 160-torr static pressure has been achieved. Power densities of at least 150 W/cm3at atmospheric pressure appear possible. The supersonic blowdown facility and electrical pulse generator are described and experimental results are discussed."
"A repetitivelyQ-switched Nd:YAG laser was used to produce \"eye-safe\" radiation near 1.55 μm by stimulated Raman scattering in acetonitrile and in methane with photon conversion efficiencies of 14 percent and 22 percent, respectively. The laser and Stokes beams were mixed in lithium niobate to obtain 6-kW peak power pulses at the difference frequency near 3.4 μm with a photon conversion efficiency of 1.1 percent."
"The details of the hole-burning process are studied experimentally and theoretically in a Doppler-broadened gain or absorption line in pure CO2and in CO2-N2mixtures contained in a test cell. The change of absorption or gain of the test cell when irradiated by a saturating laser in aPtransition is probed with another laser operating in one of manyRtransitions. In this way one may determine the rate of velocity cross relaxation within a single rotational-vibrational level and the rate of cross relaxation between different rotational levels of the upper and lower vibrational states. When the probing laser shares a common upper or lower level with the saturating laser, a pip is observed in the differential absorption or gain profile at total pressures of less than 0.5 torr. At higher pressures the relaxation across the velocity profile eliminates the pip. An analysis is presented of the population distribution in the multilevel system of CO2. Three of the relaxation rates (describing the relaxation across the velocity profile of a single level, the relaxation among rotational levels of the vibrational state, and the phenomenological relaxation rate of entry into and departure from the upper and lower vibrational states) are determined. The last of the three rates is found to be dominated by diffusion at the pressures used in the experiment."
"The effects of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and of infrared (IR) absorption on the scattering at defects leading to atomic migration in solids is evaluated in detail for certain systems.\\DeltaE/kT \\approx \\sum u_{ic}^{2}/\\langleu_{i}u_{i}\\rangle, where\\DeltaEis the activation energy, uicis the many-body critical displacement in a migration event, and\\langleu_{i}u_{i}\\rangleis the equal-time correlation function including anharmonic terms. Using the equal-time correlation for the defect lattice in the harmonic approximation, we get\\DeltaE/kT_{eff} \\propto 1/\\sum h[2(n_{s} + n_{e}) + 1]where Teffincludes both neand nsthe externally and thermally excited phonon numbers, respectively. The phonon rate density required for an observable effect of SRS or IR absorption on diffusion in solids isn_{e}^{(c)}c_{s}/V \\approx 10^{26} - 10^{27}phonons/s.cm2, wheren_{e}^{(c)}is a critical number of high wave-vector laser-stimulated phonons, cs, is the sound velocity, and V, the volume per atom. In KCI at 110 K, theory shows thatn_{e} = 0.2can produce a factor of 10 effect on the reorientation of Na:FAcenters. Anharmonic effects on\\langleu_{i}u_{i}\\ranglewere calculated and numerical estimates indicate that they would be experimentally observable for large ne. It is found that some of the effects reported here probably contribute, in part, to the permanent damage tracks caused by high-power laser beams in solids and provide an internal source for the initiation of microcracks. In addition, the direction of the stimulated phonon wave vector is shown to produce a directional effect in the control of atomic migration."

Three-frequency phase-matched mixing is described for each material."
"A mode-locked ruby laser has been built, utilizing a new kind of prism ring cavity that gives reliable single-transverse-mode operation. The cavity also operates in single-transverse mode whenQswitched and when operated in normal lasing action."
"Measurements of the gain of the P(20), 10.6 μ, transition of CO2have been made in a flowing He, N2, CO2amplifier. Both small-signal and saturated gain conditions were investigated as a function of radial position. At low discharge currents, the radial small-signal gain profile followed a J0Bessel function distribution as predicted from the electron density distribution, while at higher currents, the gain was nearly constant across the tube diameter. Further increases in the current produced a lower gain on the tube axis than near the tube wall. This spatial behavior of the small-signal gain with discharge current can be understood following the theoretical models of Gordietz et al. or more recently of Wiegand et al. The theory indicates the small-signal gain behavior is largely explained by the increase of axial gas temperature with discharge current. Gain measurements at signal levels high enough to cause gain saturation indicate the gain is harder to saturate on the tube axis than near the tube wall. An analysis of the experimental data shows that the gain-saturation parameter increases with current density."
 "A two-level quantum system is considered in which relaxation processes with characteristic time constants T1and T2are present. The shift in frequency due to perturbations at two different frequencies is calculated. The general result is experimentally verified for the\\DeltaF = 1, \\Deltam_{F} = 0transition of atomic hydrogen, when the frequency of the external perturbations is close to the unperturbed two-level transition frequency."
"Gain saturation of an Nd-glass amplifier by 1.06-μm light pulses is determined by the lifetimes and degeneracies of the two laser states as well as by thermalization rates among the components of the two multiplets to which the laser levels belong. Reported are measurements showing that although small signal gain was the same for amplified microsecond and picosecond pulses, comparable energy gain saturation occurred when the energy density of the mode-locked pulses was 1.9 times smaller than the amount for the microsecond pulses indicating terminal level filling with the shorter pulses. Our measurements indicate the terminal laser level, which is one of two unresolved groups in the4I_{11/2}multiplet, has a lifetime greater than 50 ns and a degeneracy likely to be one or two. Pulse train distortion due to saturating amplification was measured to find whether the thermalization rates among the levels of the laser multiplets were fast or slow compared to the 10-11-s pulses, but experimental uncertainties prohibit a determination."
"General relations are derived that describe the rise time of the output power of parametric oscillators driven by a time-dependent pump. Both singly resonant and doubly resonant oscillators are discussed. Results of computer calculations using a Gaussian time envelope for the pump pulse are presented and, in the case of the doubly resonant oscillator, are compared to predictions of a steady-state analysis. Agreement between calculated rise times and published values is good."

"A novel technique is reported for studying the behavior of the time-dependent gain in a TEA CO2amplifier. The method involves the incorporation of an additional amplifier tube into a laser cavity already containing a laser gain tube. The two tubes are independently operated, but so arranged that they can be fired with a controllable time delay between the discharge current pulses. This system permits effects of the additional gain tube on the lasing properties to be investigated as the time delay is varied. In particular, there is a time delay between the discharge current pulse of the laser tube and the onset of lasing. The variations in this delay produced by the firing of the additional amplifier tube have been investigated. The observed time-delay changes can be related to a simple theory for the time-dependent gain. The analysis of the measurements can be used to determine parameters describing the time-dependent gain. This method has been used to measure decay times of the gain for various gas mixtures. The techniques reported here can also be used to study other time-dependent effects within laser amplifiers."
             "It has been observed that the frequency difference between the two modes for the mode-locked Nd3+:YAG laser by synchronous internal phase modulation depends on the pumping power and is several hundreds of kilohertz for a realistic pumping power. By finely tuning the mode-locking frequency, the two modes can be excited separately."

           "Many high-gain lines in the heavy noble gases have been observed in the spectral region from1.2-9.0 \\mu. Most of the observed lines did not compete and it was possible to obtain simultaneous oscillation at a wide variety of wavelengths in the infrared using a relatively simple pulsed laser apparatus. It is believed that six of the laser lines observed in krypton and argon have not been reported. The new lines are at 0.7603 μ (Kr), 3.708 μ (Ar), 3.774 μ(Kr), 3.957 μ (Kr), 4.069 μ (Kr), and 4.142 μ (Kr). The laser apparatus used in these experiments may readily be used to construct laboratory lasers as convenient frequency standards in the infrared."
"Reflectivity of a cleaved facet forming a laser cavity in a double heterostructure injection laser is analyzed on the basis of a dielectric waveguide model and the reflectivity of modes is numerically provided for a GaAs-AlGaAs double-heterostructure injection laser. The modes that distinguish field distributions perpendicular to a junction plane are considered up to the sixth order with TE and TM modes. The dependence of threshold conditions on the mode, the relations between the lowest threshold mode and the structures of the injection laser are studied. Provided mode reflectivity is solely responsible for modal selection, the single-mode operation is theoretically shown to be possible by choosing a suitable length of the cavity even though the thickness of the active layer is large."
"A reflection-type traveling-wave light-intensity modulator was constructed and tested over a 1-to-2-GHz bandwidth. The modulator is based on a novel technique named the method of polarization-rotated reflection. This method makes use of a modified optical reflection-type operation thereby canceling the temperature-dependent natural birefringence. Stable operation of the modulator was obtained without any temperature control. It is also shown that, if a microwave is reflected back as well as the light beam, the effective crystal length is doubled. This paper describes the principle of the proposed method, the modulator design, and the experimental results."

      "The maximized continuous TEM00output power and optimum output mirror transmission are calculated for a four-level laser assuming spatially uniform pumping of the laser medium. The results are expressed in simple closed forms that depend on the TEM00mode radius, the radius of the gain medium, the absorbed pump power, the threshold absorbed pump power, and the optical loss of the laser resonator."
     "Two guided-wave structures for electrooptical modulation at 10.6-μm wavelength are proposed in this paper. They are structures that could be fabricated realistically by present technology. Theoretical design data on these two structures concerning their propagation wave numbers, attenuation rate, phase modulation rate, and dispersion characteristics are given so that an optimum design could be conceived before fabrication. In the two examples given, phase modulation rates of 3.75-9.3 mrad/V/cm can be achieved in these structures."

 "An accurate method for measuring the focal lengths of weak lenses formed in the laser media due to the pumping sources is reported. The optical power in the wings of a Gaussian beam is a sensitive function of the spot size. The change in the spot size and consequently, the focal length, is measured by measuring the change in the optical power in the wings, using a stop to block the central part of the probe beam."
                        "Photon loss coefficients in the active and passive regions of CdS electron-beam-pumped lasers were measured by a variable-length masking technique and found to be 140 and 230 cm-1, respectively. The results show there is little saturable absorption in Cd-rich CdS, and their marked difference from GaAs demonstrates that the absorption mechanisms are different in the two materials. A net gain of 45 cm-1was measured at an excitation of 8.2 kW/cm2using a nonresonant crystal configuration. This corresponds to an efficiency 700 times greater than that for optical excitation."
                    "The mixing of the excited states of an atom with the ionization continuum is considered by a modification of Fano's theory of autoionization.

"A GaAs laser for room-temperature operation is reported with high radiance and short delay times. For high radiance, the radiation of a 200-μ-wide GaAs laser diode is confined to the lowest order transverse mode. This is accomplished by operating the laser diode with an optical cavity in which the transverse mode is controlled by aperture-limiting slits. In the cavity, built of spherical lenses and plane mirrors, the mode width and height coincide with the width and height of the active region of the injection laser. The diffraction losses of the higher order transverse modes introduced by the apertures are sufficiently high to yield controlled radiation in the TEM00mode ; this control was not always assured in the earlier design of the GaAs laser with the external resonator [1]. For short delays of the onset of stimulated emission, GaAs lasers are used for which the transition from short to long delays occurs above room temperature. Also, the external cavity is coupled closer to the active region of the semiconductor diode than reported previously [1] to minimize losses that would increase the delay times. Test results on the radiance, room-temperature delay times, and mode structure of the GaAs laser with the optical cavity are presented and the observed spiking pattern is discussed."
"This paper presents measurements of several properties of Nd:YAlO3useful in the design of laser devices.

Thermal focal lengths, spherical aberration, and astigmatism forA-, B-, andC-axis rods\\frac{1}{4}in in diameter and 3 in long are shown as a function of input power. Pumping efficiencies with krypton and xenon lamps are compared for Nd:YAG, Nd:Cr:YAlO3, and Nd: YAlO3both in the CW and flash-pumped modes. Finally, the effects of varying the Nd concentration in YAlO3from 0.4 to 1.15 percent are discussed."
"Far-infrared laser emission from H2CO in the sealed-off operation has been obtained with a large gas-laser tube. This emission has been observed from the beginning of discharge to several tens of pulses under pulsed electrical excitation. The emission lines were 102, 119, 122, and 159 μm."
"Hollow dielectric waveguides with gas-filled core and a dielectric tube seem promising as laser structures. The tube fulfills the dual role of a guidance structure for the electromagnetic radiation as well as that of a container for the plasma of the gas laser. Feedback for laser oscillation is achieved by providing coupling between forward- and backward-traveling modes by means of periodic ripples of the inner surface of the hollow dielectric tube. This paper is devoted to the derivation of the coupling coefficients between two guided modes that are coupled by ripples in the tube wall. The calculation is based on the model of a slab waveguide. Expressions for the leaky-mode losses and the scattering losses inevitably introduced by the coupling mechanism are also presented."
"The mechanisms that cause amplitude modulation in CW-pumped YAG lasers were investigated experimentally. The depth of modulation and frequency spectrum of the output fluctuations of a commercially available Nd:YAG laser were measured. It was found that after performing several modifications on the laser system, the output fluctuations were reduced by two orders of magnitude. At the conclusion of the program, the depth of modulation for frequencies below 10 Hz was 10-2, and for frequencies between 10 Hz and 100 kHz, it was 10-3. Above 100 kHz, the modulation decreased rapidly to 10-5reaching shot noise level above 500 kHz."
"The first successful operation of a high-repetition-rate repetitivelyQ-switched ruby laser is reported. Using an acousto-opticQswitch, repetition rates up to 5000 pps have been achieved. When the laser is optimized, peak power outputs of 20 kW at 500 pps and 8 kW at 2000 pps can be expected."
"The results of measurements of the spatial and temporal dependence of the gain of a pulsed HF laser are reported and are compared with those for CO2lasers. While the propagation in space of a locally excited gain medium is observed to be comparable for the two lasers, the time developments are vastly different. The extremely fast gain decay rates that were observed in the HF laser are shown to be a serious detriment to efficient high-power CW or long-pulse operation. Short pulse HF lasers, however, can be operated relatively efficiently at high energies. This was demonstrated by obtaining 350-mJ pulses from a 75-cm \"pin\" laser excited by 50-ns pulses from a Marx bank."

"Frequency stabilization of a higher power CO2ring laser by locking with a stable low-power reference laser is described. Successful locking is achieved by employing a novel hybrid injection-locking technique. In the hybrid mode, the higher power laser is tuned to operate on a self-oscillation line different from that of the reference laser. Within the frequency-locking range, the self-oscillation of the locked laser is completely quenched, and only the amplified drive power of the locking laser appears. Operation of this hybrid technique relies on the line competition in the homogeneously broadened CO2medium. The hybrid technique, which is easily implemented with a simple hill-climbing servo, permits stabilized operation over a variety of laser lines. An analysis of injection locking that explicity includes the saturation of the homogeneous medium is presented. Expressions are obtained for the gain and the phase relationships within and outside the locking region. To demonstrate the potential of the hybrid injection-locking technique, a 60-W CO2laser was locked in frequency to a 0.5-W stable oscillator. The experimental data are in close agreement with theory."

This paper presents values of α anddn/dTthat were measured for Nd:YAG and Nd:YALO by a single-exposure holographic interferometry technique. The value of α for Nd:YAG agrees closely with that reported before, yet significantly different values ofdn/dTfor Nd:YAG and α for Nd: YALO were obtained. A discussion of the measurement techniques is given."
"An improved resonator configuration for CW dye lasers is described, permitting minimum circular waist areas and compensation for comatic as well as astigmatic aberration."
"The bandwidth of angle-tuned optical parametric oscillators, in some cases, is limited by the noncolinear interaction of the pump, signal, and idler beams, which results when the non-linear material is rotated relative to the pump beam. The decreased beam overlap reduces the parametric gain and increases the pump power threshold. To determine this bandwidth, a theoretical expression for the threshold is derived in the near field limit taking into account double refraction for a noncolinear interaction. Angle tuning can be done by 1) rotating the crystal and mirrors as a unit, or by 2) rotating the crystal only. Expressions for determining the tuning rate and threshold increase for both tuning methods are derived. Angle tuning about the 90° phase-matching axis in LiNbO3(the low-threshold design) is shown to be not practical. A combination of step temperature tuning and voltage fine tuning is found to be most practical in this case. A wide-band oscillator with a small threshold increase is shown to be possible by angle tuning about an axis not parallel to a crystal axis. The threshold increases very little if the oscillator is tuned by rotating only the crystal inside an optical cavity made of one curved and one flat mirror."
"Detailed calculations of the coupled equations of nonequilibrium flow and the relevant molecular energy-exchange processes, have been carried out for a continuously operating CO2gas-dynamic laser system. Power outputs of about 100 kW/m length of nozzle throat at 1 percent efficiency with a small signal gain of 1 m-1are predicted."
"We present experimental and theoretical results forNth harmonic mode locking of a Nd:YAG laser with an intracavity phase modulator operating atN = 2, 3, 4,and 5 times the fundamentalc/2Lfrequency. The bandwidths of the resulting mode-locked spectra depend upon modulation frequency, modulation depth, and laser cavity losses in good agreement with the Gaussian-pulse analysis of Kuizenga and Siegman [5]. For modulation atN(c/2L)the resulting pulse-repetition frequency is alsoN(c/2L)in all cases. However, in theN = 2case, for example, the mode-locked optical spectrum includes every adjacent axial mode component if the laser rod is located near the center of the laser cavity, but only every other axial mode when the rod is located at the end of the laser cavity. This behavior is explained by a Lamb-type theoretical analysis taking into account the competition between the two \"hypermodes,\" or sets of interleaved next-adjacent axial modes, that can oscillate separately or simultaneously in theN = 2case."
"It is known that when the incident power is large, the extinction ratio of electrooptic light modulators declines due to the thermally induced birefringence accompanying the absorption of light in the electrooptical crystals. The decline of the extinction ratio is analyzed. The important characteristics of the decline of the extinction ratio are the following. 1) It is independent of the beam radius or the surrounding temperature. 2) The decline can be reduced by simple methods such as thermal compensation. The results obtained by the analysis agree well with the experiment. From these results, it can be concluded that electrooptical light modulators constructed with materials like KDP, ADP, etc., can handle considerably high input power. This effect places an upper limit on the amount of power that can be handled by electrooptic modulators using naturally birefringent crystals."
"A theory is developed that shows the effect of cross-relaxation processes on the operation of a single-frequency gas laser oscillator. The influence of one type of cross relaxation, that due to radiation trapping, is shown to depend not only on the diameter of the gas discharge tube, but also on the diameter of the laser beam. The theory is used to calculate the saturation parameter for the 6328-Å He:Ne laser line using values of the cross-relaxation rate found from previous measurements of the cross-relaxation parameter. The calculated values are in good agreement with earlier experimental measurements. The theory is also used to compute values of the two decay rates used to fit Lamb-dip measurements, and very good agreement is obtained with the Lamb-dip results reported by Dietel."
"A theory is presented of mode locking in lasers with dispersion in the resonator and a saturable absorber, using as a starting point a circuit representation of the physical processes in the system. A set of equations for mode amplitudes and phases is obtained that entails no significant approximations and is suitable in form for an iterative method of solution. The specific advantages of the method include 1) treating the problem without limiting the order of interaction in the absorber, and 2) introducing a circuit model that allows some intuitive approximations. A general expression for mode phases in a certain situation is developed as an example and the results are compared with published material."

"Radiative transition probabilities have been computed for relaxation of the metastable5F1and5F_{2} J-manifolds of Pm3+YAG. The Pm3+YAG system is analyzed for 4-level room-temperaure population inversion leading to 0.92-μ coherent radiation; Pm3+YAG is compared to Nd3+YAG as a CW laser."
"By consideration of the current ranges over which pulsed laser oscillation on seven unclassified transitions in xenon occurs, it is concluded that all these transitions at 5956, 5395, 5353, 5250, 5008, 4954, and 3645 Å arise from the same ionization state that is most probably xenon IV."
"The consequences of the deviation from ideal coherence of the driving (pump) field in nonlinear processes are examined. A detailed treatment of the processes of parametric amplification and frequency upconversion is presented. The treatment utilizes two different approximation methods to suit the two different physical situations considered. For slow phase variations of the pump field an adiabatic approach is useful, whereas in the treatment of fast phase variations (the nonadiabatic case) an equation describing the time evolution of thePrepresentation is found to be a good starting point. In this latter case, a closed hierarchy of equations for the moments of the photon number distribution in the signal (or idler) mode is found. In particular, we find that the efficiencies of both the amplification and the upconversion processes are reduced as a result of pump incoherence, the reduction becoming more severe in the highly incoherent case. For the frequency converter, the very nature of the process is modified as compared to the ideal case, and this modification is again of particular significance for the highly incoherent pump. Second-order moments are explicitly calculated and some of the statistical properties of the output signals are examined."
"Qswitching of an Nd-glass laser by a solution of the transition metal complex bis-(4-dimethylaminodithiobenzil)-nickel is reported. The special advantage of the newQ-switch dye lies in its extreme photochemical stability."
"A number of experiments are described in which entrance and exit surface laser-induced damage on sapphire samples are studied. Damage thresholds are measured as a function of beam size and divergence at the surfaces. Temporal evolution of surface plasmas is studied using a streaking camera, and spatial differentiation of surface plasmas is accomplished by allowing the light to strike the surfaces away from normal incidence. It is found that the entrance surface has two plasma components, an air plasma that is directed along the light beam and an \"explosion\" plasma that is directed normal to the surface. The exit surface has only the explosion plasma. It is concluded that surface plasmas are a result rather than a cause of surface damage."

"High peak-power output has been obtained from a transversely excited CO2laser in a single longitudinal and lowest order transverse mode. An intracavity etalon was used for mode selection in a laser system designed to operate effectively at reduced pressures."
"We have built a single-frequency argon ion ring laser using a coupled-cavity mode selector. Utilizing the gain asymmetry caused by the drift velocity imparted to the argon ions by the dc field used to excite the discharge, we have obtained a narrow discriminant centered on the argon laser line. This discriminant could be used to stabilize the laser to the center of the atomic line. We have measured discriminant widths of less than 200 MHz for the argon 4880-Å resonance line. The sensitivity of this discriminant is compared with other laser stabilization systems described in the literature, and it is shown that our system appears to be the most sensitive of the systems currently available for stabilizing the argon ion laser."

"From the relativistic constraints upon the reflection of electromagnetic waves from targets moving with constant velocities, the frequency-domain representation of the Doppler-invariant frequencymodulated signal is derived. This frequency spectrum of the signal uniquely defines the matched-pulse compression filter which approximates to a rectangular amplitude response with a hyperbolic group-delay characteristic over the passband. A maximally flat solution to the problem is derived in closed form and leads to explicit formulas for element values in the canonic nonreciprocal realization, thus enabling a large degree filter to be constructed without recourse to numerical synthesis."
"In designing systems using matched filters constructed from passive networks, it is often advantageous to know the properties of the signals that may be matched using particular types of passive filters and noise correlation functions, but such a general classification is difficult. Some previous results on the \"positiveness\" of functions, however, suggest a possible basis for this classification. In this correspondence some preliminary consideration is given to a formulation of this approach with the prime objective of designing matching signals. When the matched filter is constructed from a certain class ofRCnetworks, it is shown that the positivity of the signal can be directly related to the positivity of the noise correlation function. For noise processes typically encountered in practice, the positiveness of the correlation function can in fact be determined, which leads to some useful statements concerning the signal functions that may be used with such filters."
 "New explicit expressions of the insertion voltage-ratio functionV_{20}(s) / V_{2}(s) - k Q(s) / F(s)[1] and the reflection function\\Sigma (s) = H(s) / Q(s)for the mid-shunt (mid-series) low-passLCladder filters in terms of the network element values are given. The relation that exists among the polynomialsQ(s), F(s), andH(s), i.e.,FF \\ast = QQ \\ast - HH \\ast, is also derived from the established expressions."
 "Some new active-filter configurations based on the pole-zero cancellation technique are introduced. First, for the rangeQ \\leq 50a singleamplifier circuit is suggested. For higher selectivity(50 < Q \\leq 500)a twoamplifier circuit is proposed. Another easily cascadable two-amplifier circuit with a reduced number of capacitors is discussed. In the latter case the filter function is determined by certain resistive ratios. All the configurations proposed-employ integrated circuit operational amplifiers (OAs). The sensitivity problem is discussed in detail. Effects of the finite OA frequency response are also investigated."
 "A transfer-function synthesis procedure using distributedactiveRCcircuits is presented. The distributed element is a rectangular distributed RC network with contoured electrodes, and the active element is an operational amplifier. These two elements comprise the entire circuit required for voltage transfer-function synthesis. Explicit realizability conditions are derived for bilinear and biquadratic transfer functions as well as for their degenerate forms. These conditions define two planes with regions of realizability within which the poles and zeros of the voltage transfer function must lie. For the case of complex roots the realizability region is defined in the complex frequency plane. For pairs of real roots the realizability region is depicted on a plane whose coordinates are both real. An example demonstrating the procedure is presented."
 "A computational method is presented to analyze the worst case sensitivity of electrical networks over a band of frequencies. The method uses nonlinear programming techniques to find the maxima and minima of a network function at discrete frequencies within the frequency interval over the entire element constraint space in order to calculate the sensitivity."
"This correspondence presents an alternate method for finding the minimum fill-in during each step of elimination for both the GaussJordan elimination and the Gaussian elimination. The correspondence also describes an improvement in sparsity in computer-aided large-network analysis by obtaining the optimal pivot at each step of elimination on sparse matrices. This proposed optimal-pivot ordering appears to lead to an overall minimum for computer storage and arithmetic operation count."
"A new variant of the gain-bandwidth problem involving transmission through a prescribed two-port is presented. It may be described as follows. Given a lossless two-port terminated in an open circuit, find the gainbandwidth constraints on the output voltage when the input of the twoport is excited by a finite generator through an arbitrary lossless equalizer. The theory is illustrated by the design of an equalizer to control step response."
"In this correspondence the relationship between type-L_{1}stability criterion for uniformly sampled and distributed parameter systems and the table form of stability of linear sampled-data systems is shown. A simple necessary condition for physical realization of nonuniformly sampled and distributed parameter systems is presented."
"This paper presents an interesting procedure for the synthesis of anRLCTtwo-part transfer function. AnRLCladder, consisting ofnreactive elements and two resistors, is derived by using a tridiagonal matrix developed by Navot. The entries in this matrix are expressed in terms of the element values of the ladder network. Two voltage drivers are introduced into the ladder network to obtain a desired short-circuit transfer-admittance function numerator degree, using the classical theorems on transmission zeros. If the numerator degree of the transfer function isi (i < n), then, in general,(i)ladder networks need to be derived. The final network, corresponding to this transfer function, is obtained by paralleling the ladder networks (with transformers if necessary). Extensions to general short-circuit transfer admittance, open-circuit transfer impedance, and voltage transfer functions are briefly discussed."
"Certain properties of the network of departureN_dand the padding networkN_pof an (n + 2)-node resistiven-port network containing no negative conductances are established. Based an these properties, some necessary conditions and a sufficient condition for the realizability of theYmatrices of (n + 2)-node resistiven-port networks are obtained. A new proof for the supremacy condition is given. Also, a necessary and sufficient condition for the realization of (n + 2)-noden-port networks having specifiedYandKmatrices is given."

 "A modified definition of passivity is proposed. It is shown that the new definition circumvents the difficulties associated with the definition given by Youla et al."
  "This paper presents a method of generating a class of equivalent networks from an initial network\\eta^{(0)}such that a transfer functionH(p)kept invariant throughout the transformation. The class of networks to be considered is chosen so that the sensitivities ofH(p)to changes in the network elements of the initial network given byS_{e_{k}}H(p)= \\frac{\\partial H (p)}{\\partial e_{k}}\\frac{e_{k}}{H(p)}and the sensitivities of all of the generated equivalent networks can be obtained by simple matrix multiplication. Partial differentiation is avoided. The equivalent networks are generated from\\eta^{(0)}by transforming the vector of network variables and the input vector in the equilibrium equations defined below. The transformation is performed in such a manner that the equivalent networks\\eta^{(1)}are generated by congruence, transforming the matricesMandNthat appear in the system of equationsM \\dot{x} = -Nx + bu_{in}w = d^{t}x. The single-output transfer functionH(p)is given byd^{t} (pM + N)^{-1} b. Provided that the equations possess specified properties, the sensitivities are easily obtained and can be applied to the problem of sensitivity minimization. Furthermore, if\\phiis the sum\\sum |S_{e_{k}}|^{2}, then the partial derivatives of\\phiwith respect to the transformation parameters are readily obtained. Again only matrix multiplication is required."
"The theory of three terminalRCnetworks is given a new unified formulation based on five relatively prime polynomials. A set of necessary and sufficient mutually independent conditions, which are equivalent to the residue theorem, coefficient conditions, andRCadmittance and impedance conditions, is given.

"In a paper by Fu it was stated that a necessary and sufficient condition to obtain a solution was found for Steiner's problem with rectilinear distance. It was further claimed that a process of iteration which was presented leads to a solution. It is the purpose of this correspondence to give a counterexample to Fu's main theorem and show that his iteration scheme does not always yield a solution. Hence Steiner's problem remains unsolved in the general case."
 "Taking the graph called the wheelW_{n}as the join ofK_{1}andC_{n}, we consider it along with three multigraph variations. A recursion formula for the number of spanning trees inW_{n}, T_{n} = 3T_{n-1}-T_{n-2} + 2, and other pertinent formulas are presented. A related resistance network problem is also discussed briefly."

"A source-coupled FET circuit is shown to produce a calculable negative admittance over a wide range of frequencies. The input characteristic is a close approximation to the cubici = - ae + be^{3}so that with the addition of a simple tuned circuit an almost ideal realization of a Van der Pol oscillator is possible."
"Necessary conditions are obtained for a time-varying network to nontrivially realize a time-invariant terminal behavior. Networks containing one type of time-varying element and more than one type of time-varying element are considered. Some implications of the results are that with one type of time-varying element present, there must be at least two time-varying components, and with time-varyingRCorRLnetworks, there must be at least two time-varying components of each type in order to realize a time-variant terminal behavior. There are in addition certain constraints on the derivatives of the component values."
"In this correspondence time-varying linear operators in a distributional setting are considered. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the operators to be representable in terms of a generalized impulse response are described. The result is given without proof and is part of a study on translation-varying linear operators."
"Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for the global invertibility of a certain general operator that arises in the analysis of realistically modeled nonlinear networks containing transistors and diodes. It is often possible to determine by inspection whether or not a certain key condition is satisfied; whenever the conditions are satisfied there are convergent algorithms for computing the solution of the associated network problem."
"A new mathematical model of hysteresis, based upon the previous work of Chun and Stromsmoe, is introduced. The model not only provides for hysteresis loops at frequencies down to dc but allows for extensive control over higher frequency behavior. Loop widening with increased frequency can be included, as well as loop narrowing (a phenomenon present in the i-v curves of fluorescent lamps). Loop widening can be reduced to insignificant amounts beyond an upper threshold or can be eliminated all together. Other behavior with frequency variation can be provided once the model is understood. Applications of the model include the simulation of ferrite \"memory\" cells and the analysis of hysteretic systems capable of operating at arbitrarily low frequencies."
"This investigation considers the problem of pulsed-carrier energy transmission through ideal two-portmth-order Butterworth resonant networks of the low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, and band-reject class."
"A design procedure is presented for the realization of selective linear-phase channel filters in a cascade configuration. From the transfer function which exhibits optimum maximally fiat amplitude and linear phase characteristics, synthesis is performed using symmetrical seconddegree transmission zero producing sections which contain frequencyinvariant reactances, and the overall network is constructed with complex conjugate symmetry. Conversion is made to lumped-element bandpass channel filters using the reactance slope parameter method. In all but very narrow bandwidths, dispersion occurs in the bandpass filter, but it is shown that by choosing a dispersive modification to the prototype, flat group-delay characteristics may be recovered in the bandpass filter."
"An efficient procedure for the design of finite-length impulse response filters with linear phase is presented. The algorithm obtains the optimum Chebyshev approximation on separate intervals corresponding to passbands and/or stopbands, and is capable of designing very long filters. This approach allows the exact specification of arbitrary band-edge frequencies as opposed to previous algorithms which could not directly control pass- and stopband locations and could only obtain(N - 1)/2different band-edge locations for a lengthNlow-pass filter, for fixed\\delta_{1}and\\delta_{2}. As an aid in practical application of the algorithm, several graphs are included to show relations among the parameters of filter length, transition width, band-edge frequencies, passband ripple, and stopband attenuation."
"A new class of monotonic low-pass filter functions which derives its origin from a method of determining optimum monotonic lowpass filters described by Halpern is introduced. These functions yield a very flat passband response and a considerably higher attenuation rate than the all-pole Butterworth functions. It is also shown by a numerical example that they compare favorably with the maximally flat rational approximants with one pair of imaginary-axis zeros when the comparison is made on the basis of equal complexity of the resulting network."
"Sinusoidal oscillators with large tuning range and small harmonic distortion offer various applications in integrated electronics. In this paper a method of generating sinusoidal voltage-controlled oscillators (VCO) and/or current-controlled oscillators suitable for integrated circuits is presented. Each oscillator circuit contains two fixed resistances, two fixed capacitances, and amplifiers. It is shown that one amplifier can be used to confine the natural frequencies of the circuit on thejaxis of the complex frequency plane, and the other amplifier (or amplifiers) can be used to effectively increase or decrease theRCtime constant and hence change the oscillation frequencies."
"Multimode electrical oscillations on large arrays of negative resistance tunnel junction elements are analyzed by applying the quasi-harmonic theory to a model which incorporates the discrete nature of the array by retaining higher order terms in a Taylor series expansion of the basic difference-differential equations. The results obtained confirm and extend earlier analyses which treated the array as a homogeneously distributed structure."
 "This correspondence presents the derivation of the secondorder approximated solution of the system included in a recent correspondence by Murata et al. by making use of the asymptote method. By these solutions, the more precise oscillation frequency and the higher harmonics of the oscillation waveform are obtained, and they are very useful for the study of nonlinear oscillation problems."
"A necessary and sufficient criterion for the stability of a feedback system with isolated cascaded null networks in the feedback path of an amplifier is developed, making use of a generalized transfer function for the feedback path which can be adapted toRC, RLC, lumped and/ or distributed, passive or active null networks. The analysis is based on some principles of root locus. It has been proved that a comb-filter type of response could be realized using this configuration and low-gain wideband amplifiers could be used advantageously for filters covering a wide range of frequencies. Experimental results confirm the conclusions drawn from the analysis. The generality of the method makes the system suitable for a wide range of applications and is readily adaptable to integrated-circuit design."
"The trajectory bounds of discontinuous systems are treated within a stability framework. In doing so, stability is defined in terms of prespecified subsets of the state space over an infinite time interval (practical stability) and over a finite time interval (finite-time stability). The discontinuous systems considered are those which are described by ordinary discontinuous differential equations which may be autonomous or nonautonomous, linear or nonlinear. In all cases it is assumed that the differential equation possesses solutions in the sense of Filippov. The results obtained yield sufficient conditions for practical stability and finite-time stability. In order to demonstrate application of the methods advanced, specific examples are considered."
 "A method of calculating driving-point immittance loci of active or passive series-parallel networks is presented. With charts and special notations for circular and half-plane loci, the calculation is as straightforward as the usual calculation of driving-point immittance. The method is also applied to nonseries-parallel networks with two variable immittances."
"A simple proof of global inverse function theorem inR^{n}is given. A global homeomorphic version of the theorem is proved first. A global diffeomorphic version follows by an application of the classical local inverse function theorem."
   "Bounds on the truncation error as a function of the number of terms used in a Fourier series are obtained. Two different error criteria, based on the Hilbert norm and the Chebyshev norm, are used."
"Beginning with fundamental observations, the concept of port orientation is introduced providing a classification of networks as oriented or nonoriented. By incorporating the orientation property in the network mathematical description, a feedback model equivalent to active networks is derived. In this way the stability criteria of feedback systems can be directly applied to active networks. The feedback model is applied to the stability study of negative resistance 1-ports, negative impedance converters, and negative impedance inverters. It is shown that the observed stability behavior can be systematically derived without explicitly including the device parasitics. Accordingly, the identity of the negative impedance converter ports as opencircuit stable or closed-circuit stable becomes systematically available."
"A set of fourn-port networks placed in an identical linear time-invariantm+n-port(m \\geq n)embedding admits at leastncharacteristic \"spot-frequency\" algebraic expressions involving the four networks of the set left unaffected by the embedding. A general method for deriving such invariant expressions is given. Starting from this basic case, the conditions under which invariant expressions can be found for sets containing an arbitrary number of networks are investigated. Known invariants are derived as particular cases of the theory together with the conditions for their existence, and new invariants are proposed. Other applications are possible in the field of quasi-power theorems and network sensitivity."
"A resistor-diode network topology is described which permits a simple iterative solution for the network resistors in order to satisfy a given nonlinear input-output specification. The diodes are modeled by the diode equation giving excellent accuracy over a wide range of diode operation. Combining operational amplifiers with the basic resistor-diode topology permits the realization of a general single-valued continuous nonlinear function."
"In the light of a detailed experimental investigation, the status of the existing theory on Bethenod's phenomenon is discussed. A critical review of the time-varying parameter (TVP) theory of Minorsky, revealing some important points strangely missed by researchers in the field so far, leads to the assertion that the phenomenon cannot be explained by such a theory. A plausible theory for Rethenod's pendulum is developed here and is extended to the difficult case of the frequently encountered bell-shaped inductance profile, using the novel concept of a dynamically equivalent continuously activated pendulum (DECAP)."
"An exact analysis of linear circuits containing periodically operated switches with exponentially modulated cisoidal inputs using the state-space approach is presented. Explicit closed form solutions for both the time and frequency domain suitable for digital computation are obtained. The analysis is applicable to any circuit configuration and can handle cases in which discontinuities in state variables occur at the switching instants. Applications of this analysis to the design of switched filters and modulators are discussed."
"The subclass of time-variable linear networks is considered which contains time-invariant components as well as ideal modulators one of whose inputs is a fixed periodic or almost periodic signal (the control signal). Using the state-variable description of such systems, necessary and sufficient conditions are given for a time-variable impulse response to be realizable by this class of networks. Two realizations are given and shown to be equivalent, although the second one, called the generalN- path filter, has certain practical advantages due to the greater degree of freedom in selecting the natural modes of the time-invariant part of the realization."
"A method for determining the noise figure and gain of an important class of time-varying linear systems is presented. The voltage-current relationships within the system are determined by a continued fraction solution of a second-order difference equation. The resulting of noise figure and gain can be determined as precisely as desired by truncating a convergent series. Numerical examples comparing these resuits with the two-frequency methods are presented for a parametric amplifier and a noninverting upconverter."
"Two floating negative-impedance converters (FNICs) using operational amplifers are proposed. Each circuit uses a common-grounded power supply and can simulate floating negative elements. The stability properties of the two circuits are examined. In line with other published grounded NICs, one of the ports is found to be short-circuit stable and the other open-circuit stable. The application of the FNICs for the design of two-directional constant-resistance amplifiers is considered."
"The effective cutoff frequency of a filter is defined in terms of the error it introduces. A Chebyshev norm is used to define this error. Easily applied bounds on the effective cutoff frequency are determined for several classes of filters."
"The mathematical properties and design techniques of a novel low-pass filter type are described. A fifth-degree filter is designed, analyzed, and compared with its elliptic counterpart. This evaluation shows that the discrimination, phase, and delay properties of the two circuits are comparable; also, the time response of the proposed filter is substantially similar to that of an elliptic function filter. However, the loss responses are quite different: the loss of the least-squares filter is much less over the lower 90 percent of the passband. As a consequence, it is anticipated that the new circuit is best suited for the filtering of signals having most of their energies at lower frequencies."
"Inductorless active filters using piezoelectric resonators are described. Because of the excellent frequency stability of piezoelectric resonators (quartz crystals in particular), these filters are more suitable for realizing narrow bandwidth responses than are activeRCfilters which are restricted to relatively lowQapplications by the limited tracking capability of theRCcomponents. In addition, because the filters are active, the inductors and transformers which are often required in passive piezoelectric filters are eliminated."
"The state-variable approach to inductorless filters that utilize resistors, capacitors, gyrators, controlled sources or negativeimpedance converters (NIC), and switches suitable for integration is described. By using the state equations of activeRCnetworks in the standard form, it is shown that multiplications of resistances, gyration conductances, transfer coefficients of controlled sources, and NIC in activeRCnetwork can be achieved by means of the switching technique. From these results, the relations between the input and the output at signal frequency of activeRCfilters containing periodically operated switches are derived at the steady state for the case where the switching frequency is much higher than the signal frequency. The results show that the cutoff and the center frequencies of activeRCfilters are adjustable by changing the ratio of the on duration in a period to the period of switching. The experimental results of low-pass, bandpass, and high-pass filters are shown along with the theoretical curves."
"Electronically tunableRC-active ladder filter transfer functions are realized by employing the four quadrant analogue multiplier as the basic nonlinear network element. All the frequency dependent branches of a conventionalRC-active ladder structure realizations are simulated by means of impedance scaling networks. The scaling of these impedances allows the cutoff frequency of an elliptic low-pass or high-pass transfer function, of arbitrary order, to be varied by means of a tuning voltage. The method is strictly analogue and leads to practical filters that employ presently available integrated circuits; external timing signals or reference oscillators are not required in order to accomplish tuning."
"Most recent papers on sparse matrix methods in circuit analysis are written to describe large problem capability, but usually the illustrations given are for relatively small problems. In this paper a computer program for frequency domain analysis of largeRLCMnetworks is described. It is regularly used on 3000-4000 node networks with many large sets of mutually coupled inductors. Timing and storage figures are given for a 3300 node problem. In the first part, the generation of the admittance description for networks with mutual inductors is described. Then the sparse matrix techniques are discussed. Some are standard, but the unique use of storage utilized in the construction of theLUfactorization makes it possible to solve very large problems in a reasonable amount of core storage and time."
"A unified discussion of leastpth approximation as it relates to optimal computer-aided design of networks and systems is presented. General objective functions are proposed and their properties discussed. The main result is that a wider variety of design problems and a wider range of specifications than appear to have been considered previously from the least pth point of view should now be tractable."
"This paper presents the realization of the hybrid parameters of anRLCTnetwork through state-space considerations. Two methods are given to obtain a state model from the hybrid parameters such that the state model is realizable by anRLCTnetwork containing a minimum number of reactive elements and no gyrators. The first method is simpler when a particular matrix generated from the state model is positive semidefinite and the second method is simpler when the state model satisfies certain symmetry conditions. The methods use results obtained by Youla and Tissi, and Anderson and Newcomb. The techniques presented here are nonclassical in that they do not depend directly on the classical methods presented.by Darlington, Bayard, etc."

"Suppose one is given two minimal realizations of the same transfer function matrix. The question is asked: When does there exist a family of coordinate transformations defined by a set of nonsingular matricesT(\\lambda), continuously dependent on\\lambda, withT(0) = Iand with(1)mapping the state vector associated with one minimal realization into the state vector associated with the other? The quesion is answered, and a procedure is given for constructing the family when it exists."

"In this paper an efficient method of generating separating sets of a given graph with the use of a newly defined concept-a cutset graph-is discussed. The cut-set graph of a given graphGis defined such that each edge of the graph corresponds to a pair of basic branch cut-sets ofGhaving the relation that the ring sum of these cut-sets coincides with an incident cut-set with respect to a vertex inG. The present paper shows that the cut-set graph is a useful tool for solution of the problem of generating all of the basic vertex cut-sets and the basic mixed cut-sets of a given graph."
"This paper presents necessary and sufficient conditions for a directed tree in the associated directed graph of a general network to be nonredundant. Based on these characterizations, new topological formulas for general network functions are presented that will not result in cancellations due to duplications. The relationships between the complete directed trees and two-trees and the complete trees and two-trees of the voltage and the current graphs of the Coates-Mayeda formulation are also discussed. An illustrative example is given."
"A method is presented for the construction of a directed graph whose directed tree graph is an open-edge train ofnedges."
 "The purpose of this paper is to present a rigorous derivation of design criteria which ensure the stability of tuned large-signal common-base amplifiers. Utilization of the Sandberg-Zames circle criterion for stability investigations of nonlinear sytems coupled with an intertwining of the charge storage and excess phase models for a transistor, generates results which disclose the minimum and maximum rate of change of base-to-emitter voltage commensurate with unconditional stability."
"It is shown that a nonlinear active device is able to sustain simultaneous asynchronous oscillations in a linear network of two degrees of freedom. Coexisting oscillations are studied for soft buildup of oscillation and small amplitudes (\"marginal oscillator\"). In the case considered the even terms of the I-V nonlinear characteristics are to be taken into account, in addition to the usual odd terms. Such an oscillator gives a simple model for the multimode operation of a maser oscillator."
"Two methods are presented for finding steady-state solutions of differential equations of any order governing certain systems that are acted upon by a harmonic force and have one nonlinear element with hysteresis represented by piecewise linearization. Both methods need the solution of a set of linear algebraic equations. In the first method, the unknowns are the Fourier coefficients of the steady-state solution, while in the second method, the unknowns are the values of the derivatives of the steady-state solution at a break point of the piecewise linearized characteristic. In both methods, the unknowns have to be calculated for different values of the time angle at the break point, yielding different corresponding values of the amplitude of the forcing term. The required solution is that consistent with the given amplitude of this forcing term. In the first method, the parameters involved in the multiple-input describing functions of the nonlinear element are unified by normalization. Comparison of the two methods is given, and the advantages of the piecewise linearization of characteristics is discussed."
"The theory of synchronized oscillators which obey the van der Pol equation is extended to include the case of two series-connected oscillators, i.e., a situation where the phases of the oscillations are subject to constraint. A solution is found for the case of identical oscillators, and a perturbation method is used to find the modification required when the oscillators are not identical. Experimental results presented for an interesting special case show good agreement with theory in the range over which the perturbation theory can be expected to be valid."
  "Spectral analysis of periodically time-varying lumped linear two-port networks is presented and a general form of the cascade spectral matrix is obtained."
"Realizability conditions for low-pass ladder networks containing inductances and capacitances with losses not necessarily uniform are presented. Explicit formulas for the element values are derived in terms of the Taylor coefficients and also in terms of the coefficients of the numerator and denominator polynomials of the driving-point function. Using these formulas, necessary and sufficient conditions for the driving-point function are obtained. In addition the relation between poles and zeros ofS_{11}and the Taylor coefficients of the driving-point function are derived. From these relations the element values can be calculated from a knowledge of the poles and zeros ofS_{11}. The results presented constitute a generalization from the lossless to the more practical lossy low-pass ladder network."
 "A systematic straightforward network synthesis procedure using nullators and norators is presented. This procedure is derived by employing a theorem which gives sufficient conditions for networks containing nullators and norators to have a unique solution. These sufficient conditions are given in terms of the topological locations of the nullators and the norators with respect to the other elements in the network as well as their element values. These are used in the synthesis of admittance matrices. Results can be used in the synthesis of other types of matrices. It is shown that there exists a simple topology in the realization. Therefore the realization can be obtained directly, without going through the actual synthesis procedure."
"There are many activeRCnetworks that implement the low-pass filter characteristic. It has been the common practice to compare these networks with regard to passive element sensitivities while assuming the amplifier to be ideal. Such an assumption gives results that disagree with experimental observations, particularly when the pole magnitudes are large. This paper characterizes the amplifier by a one-pole rolloff model and discusses the ensuing limitations on four widely used low-pass realizations. The amplifier's open-loop gain-bandwidth product is used as a parameter to generate complex-pole loci that graphically display the effect of the nonideal amplifier. The expression of the slope of these curves at the nominal pole positions is derived and first-order estimates for the resulting changes in the\\omega_{0}andQof the poles are given. These expressions can be used to determine the upper bound on the frequency\\omega_{0}that these networks can effectively realize. Experimental results agree with the predicted changes. The methods have also been applied to high-pass, bandpass, band-reject, and other realizations."
 "A technique for simulating inductance, based upon the single-pole rolloff of the voltage gain versus frequency characteristic of an amplifier, is presented. Analytical and experimental data are provided for a single-ended realization and a similar semifloating realization is discussed."
"In the design of high-Qnetworks, it is of practical significance to minimize theQsensitivity. Two types of polynomial decomposition are developed in such a way as to be amenable to the realization ofRC:NIC andRC:gyrator networks, each with minimumQsensitivity. Actually, the proposed decomposition yields the networks with zeroQsensitivity. An example is provided to illustrate the main results."
"A single-amplifier circuit is introduced and shown to be capable of realizing any second-order minimum-phase voltage transfer function while maintaining an isotopic structure. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the single-amplifier biquad (SAB) is comparable to other state-of-the-art active filters employing more amplifiers. A bandpass SAB together with an extra amplifiers enables the realization of right-half-plane zeros."
"An active double-layerRCdistributed circuit is analyzed. Design charts for realizing a second-order transfer function with real-frequency zeros and a pair of complex-conjugate poles are given using the dominant-pole approach. A fifth-order Cauer-Chebyshev-(CC) type low-pass filter with equiripple passband and stopband characteristics is realized using these charts."
 "In a previous work by the authors, a deterministic approach was used to evaluate the sparse-matrix technique for solving a large system of equationAX = b. In this paper, a probabilistic approach is used to further study the sparse-matrix technique. Analytic expressions for both the most probable number of fill-ins and the most probable optimal pivot for minimum fill-in in random sparse matrices has been obtained. Probabilistic prediction is also made for the fill-in, as well as the upper bound of the fill-in for randomly generated sparse matrices."
"The optimum impulse response of a band-limited system, viz., the van der Maas function, is derived from considerations based on the theory of entire functions. The^{2}version of the optimization problem is also discussed. In particular, it is shown that there is no square integrable impulse response that is optimum in Chebyshev's sense since the van der Maas function, which is not square integrable, can be regarded as the limit of a sequence of square integrable functions. Some modifiedL^{2}versions of the optimization problem, in which weighted square integral measures of the sidelobes are prescribed, are also described."
"A new class of wide-band arithmetically symmetrical bandpass filters whose transfer-function poles are optimally calculated so that each filter's group delay is a least-squares approximation to a constant delay over the entire 3-dB bandwidth is derived. Furthermore, the value of this mean delay is optimized. Ladder network element values, attenuation responses, and delay responses are presented."
"In this paper we study the control of the amplitude of () EA limit cycles due to adder overflow which occur in the zero-input response of second-order digital filters. We consider a digital filter model in which the effects of quantization (i.e., roundoff, truncation, etc.) are included. Our analysis is sufficiently general in character that consideration is given to a wide variety of types of arithmetic. In addition to our new results, virtually all of the previously known results concerning such limit cycles also follow from our analysis. Since our results are all obtained by a single technique, the work thus tends to unify the body of knowledge in this area. Furthermore, our technique is easily generalized, and there is reason to believe that such generalizations could also be profitably applied to the analysis of higher order systems."
"Extending a procedure first used by Jackson, it is demonstrated that because of quantization after multiplications, practical realizations of second-order digital-filter sections are limited to 24 basic structures with the same transfer function."
"Two methods for the calculation of the frequencyand time-domain behavior of networks containing nonuniformRClines are described. Successive approximations reduce the error involved. Unlike previous approximations ofRC-distributed lines the order of the network parameters, which are entire functions, is preserved. For the second method, the type of the network parameters is also preserved. Bounds from above and below are given. Timedomain analysis is performed, by numerically inverting the corresponding Laplace transform."
"The distributedRCnetworks considered in this paper involve connections of short-circuited and open-circuitedRCtransmission lines. Synthesis of driving-point immittances of these networks are considered. By using Wyndrum's classical transformations, driving-point functions are transformed into multivariable reactance functions, which correspond to impedances of transformerless networks that are positive multiples ofs_{i}and1/s_{i}, where each impedance introduces a new variable. Some necessary conditions for realizability of such multivariable functions are given and sufficient conditions are derived in terms of a synthesis procedure."
 "An active scattering matrix synthesis technique is presented. This technique leads to a unified design procedure for ideal transformers, circulators, and gyrators."
 "The concept of available power(P_{A})is extended to multiports. A theorem is proved, which gives a necessary condition forP_{A}to be achieved with all positive load resistances for the case of resistive-reciprocal multiports. Based on the theorem, a procedure is outlined for determiningP_{A}for resistive multiports. The method requires the solution of simultaneous linear equations only. Two examples are given."
"Through an example, it is shown that an alternate description of networks leads to the existence of a continuously equivalent transformation between two equivalent networks."
 "Kirchhoff modes in anRLCnetwork are defined as the class of complex current (voltage) distributions satisfying only the pertinent Kirchhoff law. A sufficient number of such modes forms a complete set in the sense that each permissible current (voltage) distribution can be represented as a linear combination of these modes. If the basic set of modes satisfies certain properly defined orthogonality and normalization properties, the response of the network to a given distribution of sources can be immediately determined by means of Tellegen's theorem. An extension of Kirchhoff mode theory to a wider class of networks is indicated."
"The minimum number of gyrators needed for the synthesis of a general nonbilateraln-port of prescribed scattering matrixShas long been unknown although a lower bound isr/2, whereris the rank (necessarily even) of the skew part ofS, that is, rank(S-S'). The synthesis procedure for losslessn-ports, due to Belevitch, reaches the lower boundr/2. For a generaln-port, however, the best known result isnand is not related tor. This paper shows that a generaln-port is synthesizable withr/2gyrators. A numerical example is given in the Appendix."
"Realization of the second-order voltage transfer function for anRCbandpass filter using the Fialkow-Gerst technique, produces, in addition to the ladder forms, a general network capable of attaining the maximum gain of unity. Design restrictions result in a compromise between the pole-Q(< 0.5), the spread in element values, and the total circuit capacitance."
     "Two new types ofLCmutators are defined here. These are referred to as type2band type2cLCmutators. The realization of these active building blocks are given using the second-generation current conveyor."
 "In the computer-aided analysis of nonlinear autonomous oscillators, the steady-state periodic response is usually found by integrating the system equations from some initial state until the transient response appears to be negligible. In lightly damped systems, convergence to the steady-state response is very slow, and this integration could extend over many periods making the computation costly. Also, one is never sure if a stable orbit exists or if the response might eventually decay to a singular point. If a stable orbit does exist, sometimes it is difficult to determine the periodTof the orbit. In this paper, a Newton algorithm is defined which in the neighborhood of an orbit converges to it rapidly and gives a precise value for the periodTof this oscillation. This algorithm represents a substantial step forward in the analysis of nonlinear systems. In addition, the algorithm meshes easily with most computer-aided circuit-analysis programs, and the initial iterates give information on the transient behavior of the circuit."
"The design of nonlinear networks whose small-signal equivalent networks realize a prescribed linear time-varying network is considered. The design problem is formulated as an optimization problem and a new theorem upon which the optimization procedure is based is developed. A first-order example is worked out to illustrate the design procedure and the effectiveness of the optimization technique."
 "A useful upper bound on the settling time (the least time required for the response to stay with a specified percentage of its final value) is found."
"The stability analysis of anRLCcircuit with a periodically impulsive capacitance variation is presented. As is well known, the solution of the classical problem of a cosine capacitance variation is given in the form of an infinite Hill's determinant. In contrast to this, the solution presented herein is obtained in closed form, which not only removes the necessity of restrictions on the magnitude of various circuit parameters, but also eliminates problems of convergence."
 "Tolerance assignment in linear networks on a worstcase basis is treated as a nonlinear programming problem. The sequential unconstrained minimization technique of Fiacco and McCormick is employed as a solution mechanism with network behavior being evaluated by means of a large-change sensitivity model. The solution mechanism also yields worst-case responses at the constraint frequencies. Examples are presented and a comparison is made with the method proposed by Karafin."
"The measure of a matrix is used to, first, bound solutions of ordinary differential equations, bound the computer solution by the backward Euler method, and bound the accumulated truncation error; second, to give conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a dc operating point; third, to determine a convergence region for the Newton-Raphson technique and establish its convergence properties. The unifying idea of the paper is the use of the measure of a matrix."
"A technique for the design of large-signal amplifiers for minimum distortion is presented. This technique takes advantage of the frequency-domain aspects of the problem by using the fast Fourier transform."
"It is shown that for digital filters there exists a direct and an indirect connection between the generation of roundoff noise by a multiplier and the effect that the coefficient word length limitation of this multiplier has upon the response characteristic: rounding can be interpreted as coefficient fluctuation, and any design method requiring fewer digits for the multipliers makes it possible to increase the signal word lengths without an increase in overall complexity. A mathematical formula expressing the noise-to-signal ratio due to roundoff noise generated by a sinusoidal signal, in terms of the attenuation sensitivity, is obtained. It confirms why digital filters with reduced attenuation sensitivity, such as wave digital filters, also produce less roundoff noise."
"This correspondence gives the statistical meansquared error at the output of a digital filter due to roundoff accumulation when fixed-point arithmetic with sign-magnitude truncation is used."
"A method for deriving the sensitivity functions of a digital filter is proposed. This method is based on the compensation theorem reformulated for digital filters. It is applied to the determination of first- and second-order sensitivity functions and to their implementation."
"The realization of general hybrid matrices for resistive multiports is a problem which is of particular interest in the time domain synthesis ofRLCnetworks from the state model. The hybrid matrixHcan be partitioned in the formH = \\left[ H_{11} & H_{12} \\\\ H_{21} & H_{22} \\right]. Two cases are discussed in this paper: 1) Realization of networks for whichH_{12}is anE-matrix. 2) Realization of networks for whichH_{12}is not anE-matrix. In both casesH_{11}andH_{22}can be singular. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the realization of a given matrix as the hybrid matrix of a resistiveN-port network are given for the simple case in whichH_{12}is anE-matrix. Sufficient conditions are given for the more complicated class of networks for whichE_{12}is not anE-matrix. A computer program realization technique is presented for both these classes of networks."
"The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the utility of the functionA +B \\sqrt{s}for approximating the coaxial line series impedance (skin effect) in applications to transient analysis. The time domain response expansions of Holt are modified in terms of two adjustable parameters which replace the physical parametersRandK. The modified expansions are truncated to yield condensed expressions useful for analysis and design. Two types of terminations are considered: 1) nonreflective, terminated in the characteristic impedanceZ_{0}(s), and 2) doubly reflective, sending and receiving ends each terminated in the nominal characteristic impedanceR_{0} = \\lim_{s \\rightarrow \\infty} Z_{0}(s) = \\sqrt{L/C}. Experimental data are presented on the frequency and time domain insertion responses of three commercial cables: RG 5B/U-68.6 m (225 ft), RG 21/U-96.8 m (317 ft), and RG 58A/U-137 m (450 ft). Theoretical and experimental time domain responses for the sending- and receiving-end voltages are compared over the time interval from the order of 10 ns to that of 10\\mus. It is demonstrated that the parametersAandBcan be adjusted to provide functions of time which closely approximate the actual time domain response over different intervals."
"A simple and efficient method to approximate a given pulse shape by the impulse response of a two-port with rational transfer function is described. The criterion of approximation is least mean-square error. The approximation can be performed very simply by using poles from atable and by determining the numerator of the transfer function, from which the zeros can be determined by solving a linear set of equations. The obtained result may be improved by optimizing poles and zeros simultaneously. This can be carried out by means of the same procedure used for finding the zeros."
"The realization of any orthogonal multiport transformer with a given \"turn-ratio\" matrix by means of four-port transformers, which are called hybrids, is considered. Such a realization is suitable for high-frequency and broad-band applications, and it is based on a decomposition of a given matrix into elementary factors."
"Simple design equations are given which predict the overall passband performance of cascaded nearly matched two-ports. The results have proved to be useful in practical applications involving the design of filters and other communication circuits."
 "In an earlier paper the author proved a conjecture of Vowels: iff/gis a positive function, so isf'/g', i.e., the positive property is preserved on differentiating the numerator and denominator. This paper generalizes this transformation process by the use of certain classes, of linear operators, both for general positive functions and for 2-element-type network functions, for which characterization theorems are first established."
"This paper deals with low-pass filter functions approximating a constant delay in an equiripple manner which does not yield a standard delay error curve. This type of Chebyshev approximation is obtained by imposing a constraint on the error curve at\\omega = 0. It is shown that using the constrained approximation, the delay approximation bandwidth fornodd and a prescribed ripple factor\\epsilonmay be equal to, or even larger than, that obtained by Abele's polynomials; the latter solution is neither unique nor the best approximation. The magnitude characteristics of the constrained approximants are very much improved and the transient responses to a unit step input compare favorably with those for the other known systems including Schüssler's functions with equiripple step response. Tables are presented which include the pole locations of some selected constrained approximants of 3, 5, 7, and 9 degrees, the comparative stopband attenuation relative to the Abele case, and the most important quantities associated with a step response."
"A technique proposed by Papoulis for approximating a delayed impulse response by a modified Chebyshev polynomial is considered. A means for equalizing the precursor and postcursor ripple in the step response of the original function is presented."

 "It is shown that a simple relation exists between the hybrid equations of a physical network and its adjoint. The same is true for the state-space equations. This relation permits one to deduce theLUfactors of one network from those of the other, thus reducing by almost 50 percent the computation required to analyze both networks."
"An efficient method of obtaining the short circuit admittance matrix of ann-port network from the indefinite admittance matrix (IAM) of anm-terminal network when then-ports are extracted from anm-terminal network is presented, and matrix methods are emphasized."
"This correspondence is concerned with the synthesis of a given active scattering operator by means of a passive operator called them^{-1}-derived passive operator (of the active operator). It is shown that by means of them^{-1}-derived operator, an active operator can be synthesized by the well-known cascade load procedure. Furthermore, it will be shown that, like a passive operator, one can define the well-known characteristic operator function for an active operator. Relationships between the characteristic operator function of an active operator and that of itsm^{-1}-derived operator are also studied."
"A direct proof of the passivity of the two-conductor transmission line is given in the special case where the line is lossless."
"Six algebraic expressions identified as the two-port four-terminal matrix parameter functions (MPF's) are derived in terms of voltage-solution and per-unit-length (PUL) parameters of any solvable four-terminal distributed-parameter (DP) network consisting of two resistive films separated by a dielectric film. Any voltage-current two-port matrix parameter of the DP network is readily obtainable as the ratio of two linear expressions involving the two-port four-terminal MPF's."
"It is showrn that the terminal solvability of a multiterminalRLCT \\Gammanetwork can be reduced to that of a multiterminalRC \\Gammanetwork. To prove the terminal solvability or the existence of a mathematical model for multiterminalRC \\Gammanetworks, such networks are considered in the form of two interconnected networksN_{RC}andN_{g}, whereN_{RC}contains resistors, capacitors, and the drivers to be connected at the terminals of the multiterminalRC \\Gammanetwork andN_{g}contains only the gyrators in it. An augmented mathematical model forN_{g}is defined. This new characterization ofN_{g}provides us with an easy procedure for the elimination of unwanted network variables. It is also indicated thatRC \\Gamma(and thereforeRLCT \\Gamma) networks are always terminal solvable, but they may not be completely solvable."
"The following bounds for the overshoot/undershoot\\epsilonof the unit step response of a band-limited system are derived:\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{\\omega_{0}T}^{\\infty} K_{0}(\\xi)d \\xi < \\epsilon < \\frac{1}{\\pi} K_{0}(\\omega_{0}T)where2Tis the rise time,(- \\omega_{0}, \\omega_{0})is the bandwidth, andK_{0}is the zeroth-order modified Bessel function of the second kind. The suboptimal response corresponding to the upper bound is also discussed."
"In the technical literature, topological conditions necessary for the complete solvability of linear time invariant systems or networks are well established. It is shown that these conditions can be made more stringent forRLCTnetworks by utilizing some properties of ideal transformer terminal equations."
"The transient response of ap-njunction capacitor to a linear ramp voltage input is calculated from the basic nodal equations using a predictor-corrector method of integration. Advantages of the numerical methods are discussed. The dependence on normalizing factors on contact potential, dc bias, and on slope and magnitude of the input waveform is indicated. Some representative response curves for abrupt, linearly graded, and hyperabrupt junction capacitors are presented."
"Classical results connecting Hurwitz polynomials,LCpositive real functions, andRCpositive real functions are all viewed as being equivalent to the positive definiteness of a symmetric matrix."
"A new proof for the terminal solvability-of multiterminalRLCTnetworks is given. In the proof, use in made of the orthogonality properties of circuit, cutset, and ideal transformer terminal equations. It is also shown that the utilization of such an algebraic approach yields an algorithm for the solution of this class of networks. Further, this approach sheds some light on the partial solvability characteristics of this class of networks."
"A relation is established between the Schoeffler sensitivityS^{2}and the variance\\sigma F^{2}of a network functionF. It is shown that under fairly general conditions,S^{2}is proportional to\\sigma F^{2}/a^{2}where a is the tolerance factor applied to all components."
"Bounds on the sum of element sensitivity magnitudes for transfer immittances, transfer voltage, and current ratios are established for networks consisting of resistors, capacitors, inductors, and gyrators. ForRCandLCnetworks these bounds are given in terms of relevant driving-point functions and their frequency sensitivities. Further, for two-element-kind networks, bounds are given for the quadratic sensitivity index\\phi."
"The elements of the networks under consideration are assumed to have small statistically independent random variations about their nominal values. With these assumptions, it is shown that the variance of a given system function can be related to its sensitivity with respect to the network elements. Recent results in sensitivity analysis are then used to establish simple upper bounds on the variance of two-port network functions."
"The wire routing problem in the layout of integrated circuits is formulated as Steiner's problem in graphs. A suboptimal algorithm is described for the problem. The algorithm is based on the branch-and-bound method. The result of the algorithm applied to several examples is also described."
"It is shown that a square submatrix of a modified incidence matrix of a composite graph is a major submatrix over the field of integers modulo 2 if and only if the columns of this submatrix correspond to the edges of a certain spanning subgraph. Based on this result, it is shown how the directed trees of the composite graph can be generated by a technique proposed in the literature."
"This work deals with the problem of finding minimal or quasi-minimal essential sets in directed graphs. Mainly based on a topological approach recently suggested, a modified algorithm for minimal essential sets is pointed out, and a new algorithm is proposed for quasi-minimal essential sets."
 "Some properties of matrix signal flow graphs are investigated and an optimum topological method for evaluating the graph gains is presented. The method is optimum in the sense that the gain expression has the minimum number of distinct inverses. It is topological in the sense that the gain expression is obtained from the structure of the graph without graph reductions."
"The Special Issue on Nonlinear Circuits includes nine papers and five correspondence items. Given the extremely short lead time between the first announcement and the deadline for submission, this performance demonstrates the vigor of the field. The contents display the variety of problems attacked, the multiplicity of methods used, and the variety of concepts presented. This performance puts to lie all those whose pessimistic thoughts lead them to claim that circuit theory is \"dead.\" All authors deserve a special vote of thanks for their efforts, both in performing their research and in meeting the demands of reviewers and editors."
"For a general class of nonlinear networks, explicit expressions for sensitivities of a response due to nonlinear elements are derived. These expressions are used to establish invariance relationships for the sums of sensitivities over different sets of parameters of two classes of nonlinear networks. It is indicated how these relationships can be used to establish the invariant nature of the sum of higher order sensitivities and a lower bound for the quadratic sensitivity index."
"Several results are derived concerning the input-output stability of nonlinear time-varying feedback systems. These results all share the common feature that they are based on an application of the concept of the spectral radius of a bounded linear operator. Section I contains the preliminary notions, including that of the spectral radius. In Section II, bounds are obtained for the spectral radius of a Volterra integral operator, and these bounds are used to obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of an inverse operator for a type of nonlinear operator. This technique is applied to obtain stability regions for the Mathieu-Hill equation, in order to illustrate the fact that the method proposed here yields less conservative stability bounds than those obtained by standard contraction methods. In Section III, several results are proved regarding the existence of inverse operators for linear operators. In Section IV, the results of Section III are applied to theL_{p}-stability problem for linear timevarying systems. It is shown that, under certain conditions, the well-known circle criterion impliesL_{p}-stability for allp, rather than justL_{2}-stability."
"Electrical networks consisting of lumped linear and memoryless nonlinear elements and an arbitrary number of lossless transmission lines are considered. It is shown that a large class of such networks can be described by a system of functional-differential equations having the form\\dot{x}(t) =f(x_{t}), where the state of the system at timet \\geq 0is represented byx_{t}, a point in the spaceC_{H}((- \\infty,0], E^{n})of bounded continuous functions mapping the interval(-\\infty , 0]intoE^{n}, with the compact open topology, and the functionfmappingC_{H}(( - \\infty, 0], E^{n})intoE^{n}is continuous and Lipschitzian. A Lyapunov functional is presented and used to obtain several theorems concerning the stability and instability of the equilibrium solution of such networks."
"Simple step-driven nonlinear dynamic networks are examined for their transient waveform generation properties. It is shown that a wide class of waveforms can be produced with networks of standard form involving two nonlinear resistors. This class is primarily characterized by the behavior of its elements att = \\inftyThese networks exhibit several advantages over other wave generation techniques, the foremost being their simplicity of treatment and application. Strict attention is paid to the realizability of the nonlinearities with commercially available diodes and no active elements. Sensitivities with respect to network parameters are considered and shown to be modest. Two laboratory examples are given. Applications to steady-state waveform generation are noted."
"A unified black box approach is presented for synthesizing nonlinear dc circuit models of 3-terminal devices characterized by two families of\\upsilon-icurves in piecewise-linear form. In order to model arbitrary curves with nonuniform spacings and slopes, three simple but versatile building blocks-a controlled linear resistance, a controlled concave resistor, and a controlled convex resistor-are introduced and shown to be essential ingredients. The circuit parameters and functions characterizing each element in the black box model can be determined easily from the slopes and breakpoints associated with the segments of the prescribed characteristic curves. The paper concludes with the presentation of several nonlinear dc circuit models for four widely used devices; namely, bipolar transistors, field-effect transistors (FET's), unijunction transistors, and triacs."
"The response of a nonlinear time-varying coupledRLCnetwork starting from a given operating point is considered. We view the response as motion occurring in a differentiable manifold\\SigmainR^{2b} \\times R_{+}, wherebis the number of branches. We impose two basic manifold conditions (MC) on the network. First, the resistor characteristics are required to be a manifold\\Lambda. Second, the resistor characteristics and their connections are such that the set of branch voltages and branch currents satisfying both the Kirchhoff laws and the resistor characteristics is a manifold\\Sigma. We then show that under the conditions imposed on the RLC elements and the topology of the network, the network has a unique response specified by a flow on\\Sigmaif and only if the capacitor voltages, inductor currents, and time constitute a parametrization for\\Sigma. Finally, we show that our conditions include as special cases the determinateness conditions previously obtained by several authors."
"Nonlinear resistive networks, which can be characterized by the equationf(x) =y, wheref(\\cdot)is a continuous piecewise linear mapping ofR^{n}into itself, are discussed.xis a point inR^{n}and represents a set of chosen network variables andyis an arbitrary point inR^{n}and represents the input to the network. New theorems on the existence of solutions together with a convergent method for obtaining at least one of the solutions are given. Also dealt with is an efficient computational algorithm which is especially suited for analysis of large piecewise-linear networks. The effectiveness of the method in terms of the amount of computation and data handling and storage is demonstrated."
"This paper presents a variety of sufficient conditions for the existence of a set of normal form equations of a connected nonseparableRLCMnetwork, which may contain coupled elements. AnRLCMnetwork is defined as a network containing independent (but not necessarily time-independent) current and voltage sources, nonlinear time-invariant resistors, inductors, capacitors, and memristors. Via an example, this paper shows that the class of networks under consideration, in fact, includes networks containing multiterminal network elements and controlled sources."
"A class of natural Lyapunov functions of the form\\Sigma \\lambda_{i} |x_{i}|, \\lambda_{i} > 0, is considered for the stability analysis of a general class of nonautonomous differential equations associated with many physical systems. It is shown that recent results on the existence of solutions to a class of linear inequalities directly yield necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a Lyapunov function of the form described."
"Passive sensitivities of the twin-Tselective amplifier are derived without assuming pole-zero cancellation. If the twin-Tis unloaded, the sensitivities are a linear function ofQ. They should not differ greatly in the loaded case since the design formulas in the two cases are shown to be closely similar."
"A greal deal of effort has recently been spent to develop numerical integration techniques suitable for the solution of stiff state equations. Instead of dealing with the integration method itself, a procedure for gradually removing the stiffness of the state equations during the course of the solution is presented. This is accomplished by gradually discarding the state variables corresponding to the eigenvalues having the largest negative real part as their contribution becomes negligible. Since the reduction process is applied to the equations themselves, it can therefore be used to reinforce any numerical method of solution, particularly in those applications where adaptation of an implicit integration method is difficult."
"Two basic properties of wave digital filters, their property of requiring fewer digits for the multiplier coefficients (to which the property of roundoff noise reduction is related) and their stability, had so far only been inferred from certain analogies with unit element filters. These properties are now proved in a direct way by introducing the concepts of pseudopower, pseudopassivity, and pseudolosslessness, corresponding to the familiar concepts of power, passivity, and losslessness in classical circuits."
"A class of trigonometric polynomialsp(x) = \\sum_{n=-N}^{N} a_{n} e^{j n \\pi x}of unit energy is introduced such that their energy concentration\\alpha = \\int_{-e}^{e} p^{2}(x) dxin a specified interval(- \\epsilon, \\epsilon)is maximum. It is shown that the coefficientsa_{n}must be the eigenvectors of the system\\sum_{m=-N}^{N} \\frac{\\sin (n - m)\\pi \\epsilon}{(n - m)\\epsilon} a_{m} = \\lambda a_{n}. corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue X. These polynomials are determined forN = 1, \\cdots , 10and\\epsilon = 0.025, \\cdots , 0.5. The resulting family of periodic functions forms the discrete version of the familiar prolate spheroidal wave functions."
"It has long been appreciated that microwave filters incorporating cascades of lumped reactive 2-ports and equi-delay ideal TEM lines offer many practical advantages over those designed with lines alone. To develop an insertion-loss design theory for these fiters comparable in precision to the one now available in the lumped case, it is first necessary to solve the intermediate problem of discovering necessary and sufficient conditions for a driving-point function to represent the input impedance of a resistor-terminated cascade of generic type. A simple decisive solution with the aid of the 2-variable positive-real concept is offered by 1) introducing the 1-variable real polynomial \"resistivity matrix\" associated with the driving-point function and 2) demonstrating that it must satisfy a fundamental structure constraint. Lastly, in addition to elucidating several important corollaries, the class of characteristic polynomials of all such microwave filters is given a description which reveals the difficulties to be overcome before an exact filter design procedure can be achieved. We wish to emphasize that the necessary and sufficient conditions for realizability presented in this paper are not algorithmic in character but explicit. To make the results accessible to as wide an audience as possible we have adopted a leisurely tutorial style with considerable attention paid to some of the more relevant background material."
"Some theorems in graph theory, which have received little use in circuit theory, are used to derive constraints on the voltage, current, and power associated with the elements in a dc-to-dc conversion network. The result is an insight into the necessary roles of the switches and reactances in the network. The application of the graph theorems to this problem shows their flexibility, and it is expected that they will prove useful in other areas of circuit theory."
"A novel technique of direct synchronization called pseudoindirect synchronization has been proposed. The performance of the system utilizing pseudoindirect synchronization has been studied and compared with that of the directly synchronized oscillator. Experimental results are also presented."
"The problem of deducing the internal component parameters from external measurements of a large-scale system is studied in the context of the fault isolation problem. By assuming an appropriate algebraic connection model matrix, algebraic necessary and sufficient conditions for the exact determination of the internal component parameters are obtained for both the single-test frequency and multiple-test frequency cases. In both cases the linear independence of the rows or columns of certain matrices may be used to determine appropriate test points and test frequencies."
"The rate at which solutions of\\lambda \\dot{x} = F(x, y), \\dot{y} = G(x, y), 0 \\leq \\lambda \\ll 1, xann-vector,yanm-vector, approach the solutions ofF(x, y) = 0, \\dot{y} = G(x, y)is obtained. Physically, this is important in the study of parasitics, in relaxation oscillations, and in other applications. The behavior of solutions of the Liénard equation near a jump is also deduced. This result is pertinent for certain relaxation oscillations."
 "The necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the existence of multiple dc solutions of circuits consisting of one ideal Ebers-Moll transistor embedded in an admittance-described circuit consisting of dc sources, linear passive resistors, and ideal transformers. The results rest upon the previous theories of Sandberg and Willson."
"A design example is worked out to demonstrate how to stabilize a phase-locked loop containing an exponential voltage-controlled oscillator. It is shown that this kind of loop can be designed with an arbitrarily large capture range, a wide lock-in range, and a short transient receovery-time constant."
"A method to determine a dynamical system, the limit cycle of which is given as a closed curve in state space, is presented. The relationship between the limit cycle and the limit surface for a specific higher order system is discussed, and it is shown that the results obtained can be applied to the synthesis of a finite-time stable system."
"The basic code proposed in the referenced parep is identical with a three-zero substitution code proposed previously, and the remaining codes are variants obtained by adding one or more zeros in front of three-zero substitution kernels. The bipolar with six-zero substitution (B6ZS) code is superior in baseline wander performance to codes based on the three-zero substitution kernels, and other differences in performance are small."

"To meet with the increasing demand for a replacement of the electromechanical ringer in telephone sets, a tone ringer has been developed to fulfill the requirements of pleasantness and detectability in a noisy environment. Paired comparison tests and word profile tests have been carried out on a number of tones. To generate the most preferable tone appearing economically feasible, circuits have been developed that are operated by the normal ringing current. A small size dynamic loudspeaker with ample efficiency and width of frequency range has been chosen as the transducer and properly mounted in a Contempra telephone set. Tests of total subjective loudness gave better results than those of electromechanical ringers. Investigations are continuing to determine user acceptance."
"The channel modem is encountered in carrier telephone systems in far greater quantities than any other equipment unit. Measures for improving the productivity with regard to this basic unit of equipment will thus be particularly effective. The newly developed channel modem uses mechanical filters for both the speech channel and the outband signaling. The channel filter has its passband at about 50 kHz and consists of 12 flexural vibrators with longitudinal coupling. Using the premodulation principle, only a single type of channel filter is required. Because of the simple setup of these mechanical filters, they are well-suited for automatic production. An improvement in the electrical characteristics is also achieved. The attenuation distortion in the passband of the loop-connected channel is within 1/10 of the International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Committee (CCITT) tolerance scheme number 1 without any attenuation equalization. In addition, an essential size reduction has been accomplished. The customary bay volume will accommodate instead of the present 120 channels the channel modems for 600 voice circuits including power and carrier supplies."
"Modern technology has made it possible to develop a new channel translating equipment capable of modulation directly into the 12-552-kHz frequency range. This range is chosen to include the basic 60-channel supergroup (312-552 kHz) together with supergroup 1 (60-300 kHz) and group A (12-60 kHz). The channel translating equipment is arranged to provide sideband orientation compatible with the North American and CCITT frequency plans. The inclusion of the basic 60-channel supergroup permits direct connection to standard supergroup translating equipment obviating the need for the traditional group bank. This equipment has been designed to anticipate the trend toward large channel cross sections where the need for the basic 12-channel group is diminishing. The channel translating equipment developed is described and its flexible application to both high- and low-density systems is illustrated."
"A lower bound on the symbol error probability achieved by any estimator of a digital pulse-amplitude-modulated sequence in the presence of white Gaussian noise and intersymbol interference is presented. The bound reduces to the well-known single-pulse error probability bound when intersymbol interference is small, but is tighter when interference is large. For example, on the singlepole (RC) channel, the effective signal-to-noise ratio for any estimator is shown to decrease by at least 3 dB for every doubling in pulse rate T-1asT \\rightarrow 0and, on the double-pole channel, by at least 9 dB, thus disproving a recent conjecture [2] on the performance of nonlinear receivers."
"A digital simulation of a second-order phase-lock loop (PLL) acquiring lock in the presence of noise is reported. Since the system simulated includes lock-indicating circuitry, a distinction is made between the time to phase lock and the time to indicate lock. The parameter of interest is the time to indicate lock. The major results of the simulation are estimates of 1) the mean time to indicate lock, and 2) the probability distribution function for the mean time to indicate lock. Results are presented for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios and for input frequency offsets ranging from one-half to three times the phase-lock loop noise bandwidth. In each case 100 independent trials of the simulation were conducted to obtain the estimate. It is found that the mean time to indicate lock is relatively independent of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) down to aboutS/N = 10dB. For greater values ofS/Nthe mean time to indicate lock may be closely approximated by the time to indicate lock in the absence of noise. The results are compared with Viterbi's time to frequency lock and found in good agreement for the highS/Ncases. Most of the difference is attributed to the time constant of the lock indicating circuitry. The system simulated is considered representative of many practical phase-lock receiving systems where there is a requirement for indicating acquisition of lock. Hence, the data presented in this paper can be used to good advantage for estimating the probability of acquiring and indicating lock in a specified time."
"The tracking loops presented herein exploit the coherency of the observed data sidebands at the carrier frequency for improvements in phase-coherent tracking, telemetry, and command system performance. The loop is motivated by one aspect of generalized harmonic analysis, viz., the so-called cross spectrum. The basic idea of the loop centers around using the power in the composite received signal (sidebands including cross-modulation components) to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in the carrier tracking loop, thereby reducing the noisy reference loss and ultimately the subcarrier reference jitter, the symbol sync jitter, and the error probability of the data detector. The modulation from the extracted sidebands is removed in such a way that the coherence power in the data sidebands can be used for tracking at the carrier frequency."
"The advent of AT-cut quartz crystal resonator filters has made possible the design of high-quality channel translation equipment with reduced cost and size. This paper describes a new channel bank, with built-in carrier generation, employing 8-MHz polylithic crystal filters for sideband selection and singleresonator filters for carrier selection. Integrated and hybrid thick film circuits have been used to provide increased reliability and size reduction The modulation plan, equipment design, and performance are discussed."
"Both in developed and developing nations there is a clear need to discriminate among all the numerous choices of telecommunications technologies and services that have been, are, or can be developed. This discrimination should be based on a knowledge of the likely effects of each of those services on the community and its environment; discrimination can no longer be left open to the sole forces of the market and it is within the engineering function to provide value judgments on the technologies it produces. In developing nations where there is a strong shortage of capital, the telecommunication planner's problem is not one of satisfying demand indiscriminately at fair prices ensuring a reasonable financial return to the firm but rather to find a strategy of service growth that will be optimal for the country or parts thereof. The comparison of alternative investment plans in the telecommuncations sector should proceed, therefore, attending to the measure in which each one can contribute towards these general objectives. Inasmuch as progress towards the different national targets is unlikely to allow for a single measure common to all of them, investment plans that are optimal with regard to different targets will also not be comparable with one another and the choice between optimal plans escapes the sector and becomes a matter of subjective national policy. Telecommunication planners should be able to find such optimal strategies and to supply global planners with elements of judgment suitable to support the decision of allocation of resources to the telecommunication sector. A review of published material in this field shows that progress towards such a situation has been very small. The paper then discusses some ideas on how the study of interaction between telecommunications and society could be advanced within a frame of reference given by current knowledge in the social sciences and in telecommunication technology."
"A modulation system is proposed that continuously adjusts its data rate in response to signal strength variations in a fading channel. The optimum variation of data rate with channel conditions is determined, and includes the effects of feedback channel time delay, the interval between rate changes, and restriction of the number of allowable rates. Application of these results to a full duplex situation allows determination of the optimum fraction of the data stream to be devoted to service information. Comparison of this scheme with diversity transmission on the basis of error probability and bandwidth utilization reveals a reduction on the order of 14 dB in transmitter power for a typical duplex link."
"A probabilistic analysis has been done by comparing cumulative distributions of voice and typical telephone-line noise, and the characteristics of voice waveform have been investigated in order to determine a new criterion for distinguishing the two signals. This digital speech detector is extremely sensitive to the onset of voice signal but much less sensitive to typical telephoneline noise."
"This paper describes improvements in facsimile receivers for newspaper transmission made by replacing conventional crater tube light sources with He-Ne laser lights. This replacement allows the system to operate at wider frequency bandwidth and provides stronger writing light intensity and longer system durability. The light intensity of the writing source is modulated by a Teglass acoustooptic modulator developed at the present laboratory and is operated under Raman-Nath mode of diffraction. Instabilities in the system have been corrected by a feedback loop using one of the two first-order diffracted lights as an intensity watcher. Experiments show that a filmed image with a transmission density of 3.9 and density rising time of 1μs can be obtained by using an acoustooptic modulator operated at a driving frequency of 40 MHz, an RF power of 300 mW, and an incident light beam diameter of 1 mm."
"A method using Hermite polynomials is utilized for analyzing the outputs of νth-law devices for inputs of modulated Gaussian signals and zero-mean Gaussian noise. New results are developed for the output correlation functions, and techniques for obtaining closed-form expressions are pointed out. Output signal-to-noise ratios for various input carrier-to-noise-power ratios are calculated, and plots are shown for a single sinusoidal modulating signal. Results are derived to show the existence of a theoretical maximum for the output signal-to-noise ratio. The method can be directly applied for the case of general Fourier expandable signals modulating a Gaussian carrier."
"Criteria recently developed by the authors for optimum capacity assignment in message-switching networks are applied to a network model which now contains nodal processors as well as interconnecting links. Linear and stepped cost functions are examined and various performance and cost-performance curves are presented. An efficient design procedure is described for the tedious case of stepped cost functions. For general continuous cost functions and the minimax design the distribution functions of all point-to-point delays can be easily calculated."
 "In a recent correspondence [1] practical constructions of matched filters for three-pulse signal waveshapes were shown. In each case, the matched filters were realized as a prefilter in cascade with a comb filter utilizing a delay line. The purpose of this correspondence is to present results that demonstrate how closely the simple two-stageRClow-pass filter approximates the matched filters for five different signal pulse shapes."
"The choice of the fundamental parameters of a pulsecode modulation (PCM) system hierarchy depends on many factors, such as transmission media characteristics, time division switching and multiplexing plant requirements, traffic demand and network topology, etc. This paper deals with the problem of clarifying these interdependences and gives the general design criteria for planning a digital hierarchy. In accordance with these criteria, the main characteristics of a digital hierarchy, starting from the 2.048-Mbit/s primary PCM system, are derived and proposed. At present, systems in accordance with this proposal are being developed in Italy."
 "The response of a frequency demodulator using feedback (FMFB) to a frequency modulated signal is analyzed. Canonical equations of operation are obtained. Harmonic distortion is calculated for the case of a sinusoidal modulating signal. Intermodulation distortion is calculated assuming a noise-like modulation. Design curves are presented. The special case of harmonic and intermodulation distortion in a discriminator is also presented. It is shown that the results obtained in this paper by treating the discriminator as a degenerate FMFB compare favorably with those obtained by other authors. However, the results presented here do not require digital computation."

"A study of source-encoding techniques that afford a reduction of data-transmission rates is made with particular emphasis on the compression of transmission bandwidth requirements of band-limited functions. The feasibility of bandwidth compression through analog signal rooting is investigated. It is found that theNth roots of elements of a certain class of entire functions of exponential type possess contour integrals resembling Fourier transforms, the Cauchy principal values of which are compactly supported on an interval oneNth the size of that of the original function. Exploring this theoretical result it is found that synthetic roots can be generated, which closely approximate theNth roots of a certain class of band-limited signals and possess spectra that are essentially confined to a bandwidth oneNth that of the signal subjected to the rooting operation. A source-encoding algorithm based on this principle is developed that allows the compression of data-transmission requirements for a certain class of band-limited signals. The utility of this algorithm is illustrated by a digital computer simulation of a facsimile telegraphy system. The scanning and recovery of several alphanumeric character images is simulated. Recognizable replicas of the original pattern are retrieved after 6-to-1 bandwidth compression."

"The A6 channel bank is the latest of a series of Bell System frequency division multiplex terminal equipments used to provide the first step of modulation and the final step of demodulation in carrier telephony. Cost and size reduction are the primary objectives of the development and are realized through the use of monolithic quartz crystal filters and hybrid monolithic silicontantalum thin film integrated circuits. This paper includes a general description of system organization, a discussion of system features, and gives objective performance values of the significant transmission parameters. Of special interest are the channel filter discrimination characteristic and the hybrid integrated circuit functions. Designed to meet stringent inter-toll performance criteria, the A6 channel bank is intended to become the standard for new installations in the Bell System."
"One of the major considerations in engineering a microwave route in the continental United States today is the selection of frequencies and hardware to permit the maximum utilization of the frequency spectrum in the most economical manner. In order to utilize the computer, the engineer must have a complete data base of existing frequency emitters and a thorough knowledge of propogation and the susceptibility of existing hardware to the proposed emitters. The procedures and computer programs to aid the engineer to properly frequency coordinate the proposed microwave facilities are discussed in this paper. The various types of emitters and the steps required for coordination are also covered."
"In the design of phase-coherent receivers employing bandpass limiters, it is customary to specify system performance relative to its value at a fixed design point. For a given design point, it is well known that an optimum tradeoff can be found between the power allocated to the carrier and sideband signals. This paper describes an attempt to further improve the performance of such coherent carrier systems by optimizing the design point based upon a given practical optimization criterion. The single-channel system is treated in detail and a brief discussion is given on how to extend the optimization technique to a two-channel system."
"This paper considers the optimum method for locating a sync word periodically imbedded in binary data and received over the additive white Gaussian noise channel. It is shown that the optimum rule is to select the location that maximizes the sum of the correlation and a correction term. Simulations are reported that show approximately a 3-dB improvement at interesting signal-to-noise ratios compared to a pure correlation rule. Extensions are given to the \"phase-shift keyed (PSK) sync\" case where the detector output has a binary ambiguity and to the case of Gaussian data."
"Digital phase-locked loops of the type employing discrete phase adjustments form an interesting class for which both steady-state and transient performance may be determined in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise. A general technique for obtaining this analysis is presented. A class of \"sequential filters\" is described that appears to be well suited to this type of loop. Their performance is characterized by a variable number of inputs per output (depending upon the input sequence) and the use of coarse quantization. Two specific examples are discussed. The closed-loop transient analysis shows these loops to have effectively a slew-rate limited phase adjustment, indicating that they are decidedly nonlinear. A digital loop \"quasi-bandwidth\" measure is defined in terms of this transient response. This definition allows the comparison of digital loops on a basis of equal signal-to-noise ratios within the loop bandwidth and, to a limited extent, makes possible a similar comparison of the digital loops with linear loops. Performance of the digital loops is found to be similar to that of the first-order linear phase-locked loop model for low loop bandwidth signal-to-noise ratio but reaches a limiting minimum phase error due to quantization of the phase adjustments for high signal-to-noise ratio. This limit, however, can be set as low as desired by choosing a small enough phase-correction quantum. The digitalloop bandwidth is found to vary with the signal energy per noise spectral density ratio rather than with the signal amplitude as in the case of the linear analog model."
"Stochastic approximation is applied to the design of a frequency-shift-keying (FSK) feedback scheme. FSK signals are transmitted over a channel with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and the frequency estimate is fed back to the transmitter. A signaling scheme similar to the Schalkwijk-Kailath amplitude-shift-keying (ASK) scheme is derived and performance curves are presented. The scheme performs much better than ASK or FSK without feedback; however, under the average-power limitation, its performance is, in general, inferior to that of ASK feedback schemes."
"A periodically pulsed sine wave in noise, typical in wildlife tracking systems, is often envelope demodulated in the signal detector. An automatic detector using correlation techniques might employ a binary (bang-bang) multiplier in the phase-lock loop to lock onto the demodulated pulse train. A threshold device in front of or incorporated into the multiplier to quantize the pulse envelope causes loop gain effects, which are analyzed in this paper. A trade off from high loop gain to low loop threshold is the result as the quantizer threshold is lowered to the point where noise envelope alone exceeds the threshold 37 percent of the time."
"When two or more sinusoidal signals are passed through a hard limiter, intermodulation (IM) products are developed at the limiter output. The magnitudes of the IM products are a function of the relative levels of the input signals, as well as the input noise, if present. This paper considers the case of three input sinusoids plus random noise. Quantitative values for IM-product magnitudes are presented as a function of input signal-signal-to-noise ratio for two specific cases of relative input signal levels."
"The series expansion for the energy distribution of quasi-niose-modulated and arbitrarily preemphasized FM signals is being derived. Computer evaluations for the CCIR multichannel preemphasis in the range applicable to systems between 12- and 1800-channel loading show that not the total phase deviation but the deviation ηtopof the upper baseband portion is the quantity governing the energy density beyond 1.5 times base bandwidth off the carrier frequency. The interference into the adjacent channel is computed and a channel spacing formula is deducted based on an interference level equivalent to 3 pW. The formula isB_{n} = 3M + 1KD, whereMis the highest baseband frequency,Ka factor between 0 and 1, andDthe peak frequency deviation obtained with peak factor of 9 dB."
"An analytical methodology (GERT) using the linear signal flowgraph topology is recommended for solution of problems related to complex stochastic networks, as a convenient alternative to commonly used Monte Carlo simulation technique. The novelty of this paper is in the use Laplace transforms in defining thewfunction associated with each branch of the network, which permits solution of the network in its entirety. Adaptability of stochastic networks in a valid representation of common control system delay problems and capability of the analytical methodology in obtaining solutions by a mechanistic procedure are illustrated by analyzing a register access delay problem. Finally, the analytical solution is compared with Monte Carlo simulation results."
"When more than one radio channel is available to serve a mobile customer in a large-scale mobile communications system the strategy used to make the assignment has an effect on system performance. Performance characteristics for five different assignment strategies obtained from a computer simulation are compared in this paper. It was found that the strategy that chooses a channel to be assigned at a base station so that the distance to the next base station using the same channel is a minimum, performs better than a strategy that minimizes the mean square distance to the next \"in use\" base stations on both sides. Also, it was found that choosing the first available channel encountered in a channel search is a strategy that produces reasonably good system performance."
"A common intermediary connecting frequency-noise calibration or testing of an oscillator to useful applications is the spectral density of the frequency-deviating process. In attempting to turn test data into predicts of performance characteristics, one is naturally led to estimation of statistical values by sample-mean and sample-variance techniques. However, sample means and sample variances themselves are statistical quantities that do not necessarily converge (in the mean-square sense) to actual ensemble-average means and variances, except perhaps for excessively large sample sizes. This is especially true for the flicker noise component of oscillators. This article shows, for the various types of noises found in oscillators, how sample averages converge (or do not converge) to their statistical counterparts. The convergence rate is shown to be the same for all oscillators of a given spectral type."
"A queueing model with limited waiting room (buffer), mixed input traffic (Poisson and compound Poisson arrivals), and constant service rate is studied. Using average burst length, traffic intensity, and input-traffic mixture rate as parameters, we obtain relationships among buffer size, overflow probabilities, and expected message-queueing delay due to buffering. These relationships are portrayed on graphs that can be used as a guide in buffer design. Although this study arose in the design of statistical multiplexors, the queueing model developed is quite general and may be useful for other industrial applications."
"In frequency demodulation threshold noise appears in the form of pulses of various amplitude and width. When a TV signal is transmitted these pulses can be detected at the outputs of a line-by-line subtractor, since their amplitude is in general much greater than the amplitude of the noise and of the residual video signal. Based on this principle a threshold noise suppressor (TNS) has been applied at the output of a phase-lock loop (PLL) demodulating a video signal. The TNS consists of two 64-μs delay lines and a simple logic that detects the spikes and substitutes for the signal the average between the previous and following line when a spike is present. The major and practically unique limit to the operation of the TNS is due to spikes interference, i.e., the simultaneous appearance of two pulses at the input of either line-by-line subtractor. The comparison could be made in principle between more lines with better results. However with the device consisting of only two delay lines the original threshold is lowered at least 3 dB. The same principle is also applicable to a color video signal. In the paper, details of the theory, the implementation, and the limits of the TNS are given together with experimental results."
"Angle-diversity measurements on a 179-mi experimental tropospheric scatter radio link have been made from August 1970 through March 1971. The diversity configuration consisted of three elevation paths and one azimuthal path. Statistics on correlation coefficients, signal strengths, and outage performance are presented and interpreted. The choice of antenna pointing angle is considered and found to be lower for angle-diversity systems than for conventional systems. The presence of a long-term correlation advantage for angle diversity is noted and in a comparison of angle and conventional diversity the simpler angle diversity systems are shown to be as effective in providing outage protection as the conventional systems."
"In the design of communication systems using geostationary satellites, it is essential to know the relationships among the slant range, elevation angle, central angle, and nadir angle."
 "A new mechanization of a first-order all digital phaselocked loop (ADPLL) is discussed and analyzed. The purpose of the loop is to provide continuous tracking of the incoming waveform corrupted by the presence of white Gaussian noise (WGN). Based on a random-walk model, solutions are obtained for the steady-state timing-error variance and mean time to slip a cycle. As a result of the mean first-time-to-slip analysis, a difference equation and its solution are obtained that generalize a result of Feller [1]. Using a procedure that appears new, an upper bound on the timing-error bias due to a Doppler shift of the synchronized waveform is also derived. An example, for which the results presented here are applicable, is considered in some detail."
"An upper bound is obtained on the probability that a specified pattern of errors, caused by a combination of intersymbol interference and additive Gaussian noise, occurs in an amplitudemodulated digital data transmission system. The bound, which is a generalization of Saltzberg's upper bound for the probability of a single error, behaves as an exponential function of the signal-to-noise ratio and the overall channel impulse response. The exponent of the bound for a pair of errors is calculated for two \"typical\" channels and in each case is fairly close to twice the corresponding Saltzberg exponent for a single error."
"Frequency-shift-keying (FSK) signals with modulation indexm = 0.5have two significant properties. They have no discrete frequency components and nearly all the signal energy is contained within a narrow frequency region equal to\\frac{3}{2}of the bit speed even without any band limiting. Unfortunately, a complete mathematical description of FSK signals in general is difficult, because FSK is a nonlinear process. A well-known exception is FSK withm = 1, because this signal can be described as the summation of two AM signals. This makes it easy to describe frequency- and time-domain properties. In this paper it is shown that by decomposing FSK signals withm = 0.5into two signals with well-understood spectral properties, it is possible to describe time- and frequency-domain properties and to calculate the effects of restricted bandwidth and linear distortion on the signal-space diagrams and eye patterns. Finally it is shown that duobinary FM can be treated as a special case of an FSK (m = 0.5) signal."
"Several new methods to generate a vestigial-sideband signal (VSB) for data transmission are presented in this paper. In these methods, phase-shift methods such as used for generating single-sideband (SSB) signals have been employed to obtain the desired VSB signal by modifying the Hilbert transform of the baseband signal either in its amplitude spectrum or in its phase spectrum. The desired baseband signal data shaping and VSB shaping functions are obtained by using IC shift registers, weighting resistors, summing amplifiers, and simple low-pass filters so that data-shaping filters, VSB filters, and their associated equalizers can be eliminated in the process of generating VSB signals."
"The use of digital transmission with narrow light pulses appears attractive for data communications, but carries with it a stringent requirement on system bit timing. The effects of imperfect timing in direct-detection (noncoherent) optical binary systems are investigated using both pulse-position modulation (PPM) and on-off keying for bit transmission. Particular emphasis is placed on specification of timing accuracy and an examination of system degradation when this accuracy is not attained. Bit error probabilities are shown as a function of timing errors from which average error probabilities can be computed for specific synchronization methods. Of significance is the presence of a residual or irreducible error probability in both systems, due entirely to the timing system, which cannot be overcome by the data channel."
"Numerous articles have been written on the general properties of impulse noise, models for it, and its effects on data transmission. Most of these make an attempt to apply or generate some particular theory with respect to the phenomenon. A literature search has given rise to an awareness of the need for a paper devoted solely to the idiosyncrasies of impulse-noise measurements and their interpretation. This paper first distinguishes impulse noise from background or message-circuit noise, then addresses itself to the time-variability problems associated with impulse noise. The use of electronic versus electromechanical impulse-noise counters is then discussed, followed by a presentation of practical measuring techniques, and finally by a few words on mitigative measures."
"The Pacific Intertie has the world's longest highvoltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line. Its presence in proximity to communications circuits poses a potential interference problem with respect to electrostatic and electromagnetic induction and a possible electrolysis problem with respect to underground metallic structures located near the line's earth electrodes. This paper traces the history of testing endeavors by representatives of interested and concerned agencies, companies, and utilities in an attempt to define the magnitude of the problem in order that mitigative measures could be planned."
"The results of an extended series of propagation measurements to determine the envelope frequency correlation coefficients at 4.6 and 7.6 GHz over four paths ranging from 140 to 200 km are reported. Comparison is made with previous experimental findings and with the models of Rice [6], Sunde [9], and Bello et al. [11]. The correlation coefficients measured simultaneously at the two frequencies were found nearly equivalent although a marked time dependence was evident over periods as short as 30 min. A discussion is given of the several expressions that have been referred to as envelope correlation functions, a distinction that is necessary when comparing the results of various workers and empirical models. An attempt is made to modify the empirical parameters entering the models to agree best with the experimental findings."
"Powers' square-law single-sideband (SSB) signal is shown to be to ordinary SSB roughly what amplitude modulation (AM) with carrier is to amplitude-modulation suppressed carrier (AMSC) signaling. That is, both SSB and AMSC require coherent demodulation at the receiver to recover the information signal properly and this requires the slaving of the receiver to the transmitter or at least the use of expensive phase-locking circuitry. A carrier is added to the AMSC signal to make possible inexpensive incoherent demodulation at the receiver (envelope detection) and the resulting transmission inefficiency and loss of SNR in the receiver are accepted to achieve this simple detection. In the same manner, Powers' square-law SSB allows inexpensive incoherent demodulation at a loss in transmission efficiency and receiver SNR. This loss in SNR is found to always be within 3 dB of that in AM envelope detection for large SNR when equal input-signal power and noise spectraldensity levels are assumed. Further, there are situations for which the SNR performance is better than AM envelope detection (i.e., 100 percent tone modulation is one such case). The main difference is that AM with carrier and AMSC require twice the transmission bandwidth of SSB or Powers' square-law SSB."
"This correspondence is concerned with the closedform computation of tight upper and lower bounds to the primary zone spectrum existing at the output of a symmetrical hard limiter driven by stationary zero-mean Gaussian noise whose spectral shape is that of a narrow-band first-order Butterworth bandpass filter."

"An FM/FM system is one in which the signal information frequency modulates a subcarrier, which, in turn, frequency modulates a main carrier for transmission. The detection process then involves two frequency demodulators in sequence. Using Rice's click model for both FM demodulators, we obtain the average click rate and an approximate output spectrum that include the effect of the impulses generated by the carrier demodulator on the subcarrier demodulation at and below threshold. We then focus on the threshold behavior of these systems and the proportioning of their modulation parameters so as to provide certain desired characteristics. We find that due to the filtering action of the second demodulator, the number of output clicks from carrier generated spikes can be orders of magnitude smaller, yet their contribution to the output noise can be much greater than that produced by the first demodulation. In fact, this term is dominant in the thresholding of the subcarrier demodulators except for the most fully loaded multiplex. In the latter case, there is so little deviation available for each channel that the self-clicks produced by the subcarrier demodulation in the absence of carrier spikes become severe. We also find that each channel has a critical carrier modulation index below which the output clicks exceed the carrier generated clicks."

   "Digital communication networks used for the distribution of high-speed digital information are currently the subject of design studies for many civil and military applications. This paper presents results that are useful in such studies as well as in network planning. In particular, the paper is concerned with the problems of carrier synchronization and noisy reference detection of polyphase signals. Reconstruction of coherent references for the detection of polyphase [N-ary phase-shift-keyed (PSK)] signals is considered and analyzed for three carrier reconstruction loops, namely,Nth power (multiply-and-divide) loops, generalized Costas (I-Q) loops, and extensions of data-aided (modulation wipeoff) loops. General expressions for the error probability are developed when the reconstructed reference signals are noisy. These expressions are evaluated numerically for cases of practical interest and compared with differentially coherent reception."
"This paper describes a recursive algorithm to calculate the probability that all paths between two nodes in a given network are interrupted. It is assumed that all links are undirected and that links and nodes fail with given probabilities. These failures are assumed to be statistically independent. The probability that two nodes are disconnected is expressed in terms of the probability that pairs of nodes are disconnected in subnetworks smaller than the original one. The advantage of the algorithm given in this paper compared to other known procedures results from the fact that, in most cases, these subnetworks can be considerably simplified. These simplifications lead to considerable savings in computing time."
"This paper deals with a heuristic procedure for optimizing the reliability of computer networks consisting of clusters of terminals connected to remote concentrators that are connected to a data-processing center. The expected percentage of terminals connected to the processing center is used as a measure of network reliability. It is shown that configurations other than the frequently used star are often considerably more reliable and less expensive."
"A theoretical method is presented for finding the amplitude density of a periodic waveform expressed in terms of a truncated trigonometric Fourier series. If the waveform is approximated bynharmonics, the density depends on the roots of a polynomial of degree 2nwhose coefficients are simple functions of the Fourier series coefficients."
"The ARPA computer network (ARPANET) is a nationwide network of diverse autonomous computers connected via a message-switching store-and-forward communications subnet using leased wide-band (50-kbit/s) telephone lines. A primary objective of the ARPANET is to share preexisting programs and data. Many of the difficulties of using remotely generated programs and data are found to be simple format incompatibilities requiring data manipulations like character set conversion, header prefacing and stripping, packing and unpacking of repeated data, generating counters and flags, and field transposition. The data reconfiguration service (DRS) is an attempt to provide a convenient way of performing these data manipulations in order to mediate between superficially incompatible data streams connecting existing programs in the ARPANET. Desiring to match two incompatible input-output streams, an applications programmer specifies a data stream transformation (called a form) written in the data reconfiguration language (DRL). Associating the appropriate form name with the connection between his two programs, the programmer causes the DRS to follow his instructions on how the specified data streams are to be manipulated in the communication required to make the two programs cooperate over the ARPANET. Components of the DRS include the specification of its special-purpose data reconfiguration language, a form compiler to translate forms into fast-running transformation programs, an interpreter to perform high-speed data transformations at application program run time, and a standard set of ARPANET protocols for the routine handling of connections and form specifications between operating systems."
"This paper describes an investigation of channel spacing for multiple biphase-shift-keyed (BPSK) signals accessing a hard-limiter satellite. The effects of intermodulation and modulation spectrum interference on the bit error rate of the active channels were considered. Results and conclusions of experimental errorrate data are presented for various channel spacing arrangements. Of major significance is the formation of rules for the spacing of active channels when six or more BPSK signals are accessing the hard limiter."
"We consider here the problem of selecting the lowpass sampling bandwidth for a digital mechanization of a matchedfilter bit-synchronizer combination. In particular, if digital data at a rateRbits/second plus Gaussian noise is passed through a filter of bandwidthKRand then sampled at the Nyquist rate, i.e.,2 KR, then how small can we chooseKwithout paying an appreciable penalty in the SNR performance of the data detector?"
"In this paper the performance of a radiometric receiver preceded by a bandpass limiter is studied when the input is a fading binary frequency-shift-keyed signal. An expression for the probability of error versus signal-to-noise ratio, with receiver bandwidth as a parameter is derived. It is seen that limiting does not necessarily improve receiver performance, as is often thought."
"This paper presents an approach to the optimum digital demodulation of a continuous-time FM signal using stochastic estimation theory. The primary result is a digital phase-locked loop realization possessing performance characteristics that approach those of the analog counterpart. Some practical considerations are presented and simulation results for a first-order message model are presented."
"In comparing different techniques for multiplexingNbinary data signals into a single channel, time-division multiplexing (TDM) is known to have a theoretic efficiency of 100 percent (neglecting sync power) and thus seems to outperform frequencydivision multiplexing systems (FDM). By considering more general FDM systems, we will show that both TDM and FDM are equivalent and have an efficiency of 100 percent. The difference between the systems is in the multiplexing and demultiplexing subsystems, but not in the performance or in the generated waveforms."
"This paper develops performance criteria for evaluating transform data coding schemes under computational constraints. Computational constraints that conform with the proposed basis-restricted model give rise to suboptimal coding efficiency characterized by a rate-distortion relationR(D)similar in form to the theoretical rate-distortion function. Numerical examples of this performance measure are presented for Fourier, Walsh, Haar, and Karhunen-Loève transforms."
"Marketing surveys on data communication have indicated the possible need for a new data service. Technical studies have resulted in a number of detailed proposals for providing a service which, although functionally distinct, is physically integrated with other telecommunications services. The proposed network utilizes synchronous digital transmission with a processor-controlled TDM switching structure. A range of speeds is available. Users' data bytes are structured in \"envelopes\" to provide an inband control signaling facility. The use of a processor for switch control gives greater flexibility, allows the implementation of sophisticated diagnostics, and, with high-speed interswitch signaling, reduces overall call set-up times. The proposed network is hybrid in that it can operate in a conventional circuit switched mode, or operate in a \"packet\" switched mode. Extensive multiplexing is used to increase transmission utilization and reduce local area transmission costs."
"The switching of addressed blocks of data through a network (message switching) is particularly suited to the sort of inquiry-response communication characteristic of many business transactions. In a system of interconnected loops, efficient message switching can be attained with distributed control rather than common control. The initial capital investment in such a system would be low and the investment would grow only as the system grew."
"Laser Doppler velocimeters provide a noncontact method for the measurement of velocities. These measurements are, in general, corrupted by noise arising in the transmission and reception of the optical carrier. An analysis is presented for the effect of noise on the output of the velocimeter system under conditions of high scattering center concentrations and Steady flows. Principally, the so-called Gaussian beam optical setup is considered where the intensity distribution of the intersecting laser beams at the observation volume (fringe pattern) is Gaussian. Output noise spectral densities, noise power, and signal-signal-to-noise ratios are derived in terms of the input signal (Doppler carrier)-tonoise ratios and bandwidths of the processing systems. Also, threshold levels for input signal-to-noise ratios are determined and the photodetector performance analyzed. Finally, analogies are drawn where the current analysis is applicable to other areas of communication."
"Most engineers accept that an angle-modulated signal can be demodulated given only its zero crossings. Unfortunately, proofs of this fact tend to be either quite complicated and devoid of physical insight or to incorporate a significant amount of intuition. The treatment in this paper is cast in terms of sampling theory and trigonometric interpolation. Under this viewpoint, the effects of devices such as digital frequency dividers and pulse-count discriminators are quite easy to understand, and the enhanced noise immunity associated with bandwidth expansion can be interpreted in terms of diversity reception."
"A theoretical analysis is presented of an adaptive detector in a synchronous serial data-transmission system. A binary-coded signal is transmitted over a baseband channel, which introduces slowly time-varying signal distortion. The received signal is sampled and each signal element is detected by means of an iterative process that uses some or all sample values dependent on that element. The intersymbol interference of the signal element in the following elements is then canceled, before the detection of the next element, and so on. Immediately after the detection of each signal element, the channel impulse response is estimated and the detector is adjusted appropriately, so that it follows the variations in the channel transmission characteristics. No training signal is required except at the start of transmission. The tolerance to additive white Gaussian noise is evaluated for different arrangements of the basic system and for various values of the signal distortion in transmission, assuming the detector to be correctly matched to the channel."
"This paper studies the effectiveness of certain group codes in reducing the root-mean-square (rms) error in a digital telemetry link. The zero-sampling-error lower bound on the total error is derived for the case when majority-logic-decodable group codes are used in the channel. Calculated data are presented for several such codes including two new cyclic unequal-error-protection codes."
"Longitudinal balance should be measured by a standard method that will accurately show the degree of unbalance to ground of components or networks. The method proposed by the IEEE's Wire Communication Committee and under consideration by International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Committee (CCITT), was tested, using techniques found necessary to avoid errors. Calculated data were used to prove the precision of measurements, and are included to indicate the magnitude of unbalance caused by resistors, capacitors, and inductors."
"Wire-line channels are often used for transmission of high-speed protective relaying signals at power stations. In situations where the communications plant is exposed to severe environmental stress during a power fault, special engineering of plant protection is necessary. A series of staged faults in an inductive environment was conducted jointly by the Bell System and Public Service of Colorado. The purpose of these tests was to observe the operation of the relaying terminals and monitor the communication system during a fault. A series of steps was taken to ensure cable dielectric integrity and eliminate sources of transmission interference. The communications system was stressed with up to 3800 V. rms generated by electromagnetic induction from a parallel faulted ll5-kV power line. The resulting specially engineered communications system withstood the induced voltage and allowed reliable transmission of relaying signals."
"A coherent binary FSK modulation system is discussed, that has the following properties: 1) it is phase coherent; 2) it has a low deviation ratio,h = \\frac{1}{2}; 3) it occupies a small RF bandwidth, typically only 0.75 times the bit rate, without need for intersymbol interference correction; 4) it uses as receiver a self-synchronizing circuit and a phase detector, which together achieve optimal decisions; and 5) its error performance is about S dB better than that of conventional FSK."
"On June 7, 1969, a major milestone in the augmentation of the Defense Communications System's global automatic voice network (AUTOVON) was achieved with the simultaneous cutover into an operational network of four automatic switching centers in Europe and one in Panama. With this cutover, for the first time direct-distance dialing on a worldwide basis became possible for AUTOVON subscribers. This successful cutover followed a period of intensive testing in which the switching equipment was thoroughly checked out, after which the entire system was tested in its operational configuration to ensure that the new system would provide satisfactory service to its high-level subscribers. A description of the test philosophy, test conduct, and test result is contained in this paper, together with recommendations for improvement in future cutovers."
"A variable length feedback scheme for binary constant antipodal signals with an upper bound on the decision time is proposed. In addition to the noiseless decision feedback channel a noiseless information feedback channel is used for energy saving. The performance of the scheme is derived, and the probability of error as a function of the average energy per symbol is compared to existing systems. Two of the existing systems may be obtained as limiting cases of the combined scheme considered here."
"The use of an information-feedback procedure, called \"feedback averaging,\" is applied to anM-ary polarization-modulated laser communication system. The systems with and without feedback, which are limited by photon fluctuation, are considered and compared. A significant improvement in error rate of a system with feedback is demonstrated over a one-way system for a quarternary system subject to intensity constraint."
"In this paper, a first-order discrete phase-locked loop that tracks the phase of an incoming analog signal at discrete instants of time occurring once per cycle of the carrier is developed. The functional loop components and the operation of the loop are described in detail. The loop model is developed for both the deterministic and noisy case by a nonlinear coupled difference equation with perturbed (or deviating) arguments. The tracking performance for the inputs of the phase step, the phase ramp, and the sinusoidally modulated carrier is determined and the locking conditions for these input transients are derived. Conceptual designs using this first-order digital loop have been given for the demodulation of phase- and frequency-modulated signals."
"This paper presents comparative performance results for three rate\\frac{1}{2}burst-trapping error-correcting codes using real channel error data gathered by USAECOM on microwave and/or wide-band cable links operating at 40.8 kbits/s. A limited amount of error data gathered on the German telephone network has also been used."
"This paper provides a tutorial exposition of the possible use of sequency filters for the processing of signals that are functions of two space variables. Historically, optical and, more recently, digital techniques have been used for two variable processing of images with the computer providing a domain for other than sinecosine filtering. Sequency filters based on Walsh or similar functions can be implemented with about equal effort for time and space variable signals. They could actually be built with electronic components up to the ultimate case of signals with one time and three space variables. Two kinds of filters have emerged so far: instantaneous filters and sampling filters. In the following sections we briefly discuss other possible transforms for space filters before investigating sequency-oriented filtering techniques. The sequency techniques include instantaneous filters, efficient practical implementation, and some potential circuits for imagery applications."
"Previous work has shown that the mean time from lock to a slipped cycle of a phase-locked loop is given by a certain double integral. Accurate numerical evaluation of this formula for the second-order loop has proved extremely vexing because the difference between exponentially large quantities is involved. This article simplifies the general formula to avert this problem, provides a useful approximation to a needed conditional expectation, and produces an asymptotic formula for the mean slip time that is moderately accurate even at low loop SNR (less than 7 dB) and small steady-state phase errors (less than 0.3 rad). The approximations extend to higher order loops, as well."
"A closed-form analytical expression is obtained for the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR0) of differential PCM systems operating on noisy digital channels. A procedure is then proposed for maximizing SNR0by joint optimization of the quantizer, predictor, and sampling rate. Several examples are considered, including one- and two-sample feedback systems excited by speech and video (Gaussian) signals. The predictor used in the DPCM system is linear and time invariant, but otherwise arbitrary. As with PCM, contributions to output signal distortion can be expressed as a sum of three separate terms resulting, respectively, from quantization errors, channel transmission errors, and mutual errors arising from interaction between quantization and channel errors. When a conventional optimum linear predictor is used, transmission errors are shown to be no more serious for DPCM than for PCM. The results show that SNR0for a well-designed DPCM system is considerably higher than for a well-designed PCM system operating on the same digital channel, even if the channel is noisy. In considering examples, particular attention is devoted to determining maximum values for SNR0and to examining the dependence of SNR0on predictor coefficient values, number of quantization levels, sampling rate, message statistics, and channel error probability. Implications of this dependence on system design are noted."
"Space-division digital-switching networks are proposed as switching systems of a future communication network suitable for introduction of new services. Network construction methods for video signals are considered. Hybrid-switching networks using two kinds of coding systems will be available for both simplification of equipment and high-quality transmission. Consideration is also given to future network formats, which will be gradually digitalized. Introduction of a pulse-stuffing synchronization system into switching networks is proposed here. For video signals, this system is presumed to be more economical than the mutual synchronization system. New techniques, such as junctor-stuffing synchronization and destuffing with qnantized clock rates, are discussed."
"Isopreference tests were used to study the subjective effects of channel transmission errors on computer-simulated PCM and previous-sample feedback DPCM voice systems. Numerically scaled isopreference contours were obtained and plotted on planes having as axes the number of quantization bitsNand the bit error probabilitypof the binary symmetric transmission channel. For anyNandpconsidered, the quality of DPCM speech was found to exceed that of PCM speech. WithNfixed andpdecreasing, the improvement of DPCM relative to PCM increased to the point where quantization noise limited the performance of both systems. Two nonredundant codes, natural binary and folded binary, were used to encode the quantizer output. The two codes yielded comparable speech quality. The maximum subjective quality obtainable for white Gaussian and Rayleigh fading channels was determined as a function of channel capacity. Use of optimum channel encoding was shown to reduce considerably the channel capacity required to obtain a given speech quality. The subjective ratings were compared with measured system signal-to-noise ratios. Finally, the effect of the overload level of the quantizer on the system signal-to-noise ratio was determined."
"A simple partitioned Markov chain model is proposed for characterization of the HF channel. It is demonstrated that from the model, the error-burst distribution can be derived with good agreement with simulation results. In this paper the transition probability matrixPof the model is raised to theNth power PN. PNis used to represent the channel after interleaving of degreeN. The error-burst distribution after interleaving is derived from PN. The results show again that there is good agreement between calculated and simulated error-burst distribution. It is concluded that the model can be employed to study the effect of interleaving on burst-error channels."
"The transmission of data, telegrams, or narrative messages (record material) over the facilities of one or more telecommunication networks requires agreed-to message formats and communication-link control procedures for traffic interchange over these networks. This paper is designed to be a definitive discussion of the principles to be used for developing message formats and control procedures. The paper is based primarily upon the current efforts of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)Task Group X3S33, Message Header Formats and Task Group X3S34 Control Procedures."
"A method of using state-transition diagrams for writing and implementing control programs for teleprocessing devices is presented. Currently used techniques are briefly compared with this method. The simple example of reading a teletype is discussed. The technique is evaluated solely upon ease of program preparation and resource optimization is not considered. Generalizations and extensions of the technique are suggested. A detailed example of a state-transition program controlling an IBM S/360 channel-to-channel adapter is presented in the Appendix."
"Demultiplexing serves as an important function for statistical multiplexors. Its purpose is to reassemble the received message and distribute it to the appropriate destination. An important cost consideration for this function is the size of the buffer necessary to meet a specified overflow service requirement. The demultiplexing buffer can be modeled as a finite waiting room queueing model with batch Poisson arrivals and multiple distinct constant servers. Stimulation is used to study buffer behavior for traffic arriving at the buffer according to the uniform, linear, step, and geometric destination functions. The relationships among buffer overflow probability, buffer size, traffic intensity, average message length, and message destination are presented in graphs to provide a guide in the design of demultiplexing buffers. Simulation results reveal that buffer input messages that have short average message lengths and uniform traffic destinations yield the best buffer behavior. Thus, in planning the CPU scheduling algorithm and in selecting the demultiplexing output rates, the designing of a computer communications system that uses the statistical multiplexing technique should also consider the output statistics needed to achieve optimal demultiplexing performance."
"The manner in which the performance of a communication processor (CP) can be expected to deteriorate under extreme loading conditions has been studied through general-purpose simulation system (GPSS). Processing of characters to determine their disposition when they initially arrived at the CP was assumed to be the primary factor limiting performance under extreme loads and was hence modeled carefully. The CP proved to have an extremely sharp saturation threshold, with the threshold very sensitive to minor variations in character processing times. Simple design criteria for ensuring satisfactory performance without resorting to an extreme worst case design were developed. Also, the effects of some changes in buffering and in the use of priorities were determined."
"Core buffers are used in teleprocessing systems for handling queueing and transfer of messages between all communication lines and queueing media. Management of data buffers for incoming and outgoing messages is an important task in running a real-time system at optimal efficiency. There are several factors that a system designer must consider in weighing the tradeoff of time and main storage. This paper deals with the analysis of several practical buffering techniques and provides procedures for determining the buffer size, which satisfies a prespecified probability of overflow."
"The digital data-transmission network studied takes the form of interconnected loops or rings of users. The present report describes a simulation study of a single ring of users undertaken for the dual purpose of observing and evaluating such quantities as message delay, buffer occupancy, and busy-idle periods, and of comparing previous analytical work concerning message delay with values obtained from simulation. The study focused on homogeneous users although other user populations are discussed. Other aspects examined, though not in as great detail, are effects of quantization of message segments, line utilization, and system capture by competing communities of users. Principal conclusions reached can be stated as follows. 1) Under quite reasonable conditions, user-induced message delay is small for moderate line loads. 2) Simulated delays and theoretical estimates of message delays are in good agreement over a wide range of line loads."
"Recent advances in computer communications are discussed including computer-traffic and channel error characteristics, optimal fixed message block size, statistical multiplexing, and loop systems. A unified model is developed and then used to analyze the queueing behavior of the star and loop systems. Numerical results for selected traffic intensities and message lengths, given in graphical form, provide insight into the performance of these systems."
"A terminal-oriented computer system that is to serve a variety of different terminal types can achieve the economy of statistical sharing of its access lines and can best take advantage of each terminal type, if it can fully identify the terminal type and speed at the time of terminal approach to the system. The advantages of more complete identification of terminal speed and type are developed. The properties of terminals are classified from the standpoint of their necessitating or facilitating such identification. Historical methods of determining the type of terminal approaching a system are discussed. A recognition character algorithm for simultaneously determining the terminal speed and type is described. Some terminal features are proposed that would permit the general application of such algorithms."
 "Any communication network has a finite traffic capacity and if it is offered traffic beyond the limit it must reject some of it. The data-communication network studied here is one employing packet switching, like the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) network. It handles blocks of data, called packets, and longer messages are subdivided, rather in the same way that store in a computer is allocated in pages. A method of controlling congestion is proposed in which there is a finite number of packet carriers in the whole network. When a packet of data is delivered to its destination node the \"empty\" packet is available for reuse. The empties move randomly round the network and new data must capture an empty packet carrier before being launched into the network. Various elaborations are described that avoid delay in normal conditions. This so-called \"isarithmic\" method of congestion control supplements and does not replace end-to-end flow control."
"TYMNET is a large full duplex terminal oriented network that has been developed by Tymshare, Inc. The network is composed of over 100 interconnected computers serving as hosts or nodes. The evolution of this network was made possible by resolving a variety of hardware, software, and telecommunications problems. This paper describes the steps that took place in this evolution, the problems that were encountered at each of these steps, and how they were solved."
"Three Michigan universities are currently working on a project to evolve a network that will link their educational and research computing centers. This project requires the concurrent development of several interrelated technical activities, the most important of which are the network's specialized hardware, software for the network's communications computers, and support software for each of the host computers. The specific topic of this paper is the network's unique hardware configuration, its general design, and the rationale behind its particular specifications. Also included are descriptions of special interfaces developed for the system's synchronous data sets, and the IBM system 360 and Control Data 6000 series computers."
"For a communication loop connecting a multiplicity of terminals to a central processing location, alternative datalink control techniques are defined. An upper bound on allowable loading of the loop is established for each of these and compared to that of a perfect data-link control."
"In this paper, we discuss flow control in a resourcesharing computer network. The resources consist of a set of inhomogeneous computers called hosts that are geographically distributed and are interconnected by a store-and-forward communications subnet. In the communication process, messages pass between hosts via the subnet. A protocol is used to control the flow of messages in such a way as to efficiently utilize the subnet and the host resources. In this paper, we examine in some detail the nature of the flow control required in the subnet and its relation to the host flow control and subnet performance."
"The scope of this paper is to describe the architecture of a communications line protocol for computer networks. Development and implementation details will be introduced where necessary to clarify the presentation. The need for an architecture to facilitate interprocessor communications has been a requirement to the computing industry for several years. The described line protocol was derived through an experiment with a computer network designed for heterogeneous machines, and which utilized existing software. Due to the inflexibility encountered by this approach, the architecture is being reimplemented using our own software. The line interface was defined with flexibility as the foremost requirement. The protocol developed utilizes a minimum set of line-control characters. Information is passed in the header portion of the transmitted block providing the capability of identifying a wider range of line-control and user-related functions. Error recovery has been implemented based on the same type of messages and by transferring line timing responsibilities from the hardware to the software."
"An extensive measurement capability has been implemented in the interface message processors (IMP) of the ARPA network of computers. These measurement facilities were implemented by the network contractor, Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, Inc., to meet the measurement needs of the University of California, Los Angeles, (UCLA) network measurement center, and consist of software routines within the store-and-forward IMP to accumulate statistics, periodically record snap shots, trace selected messages through the net, and to be able to generate artificial traffic. These capabilities have been augmented by routines at the Network Measurement Center to provide selective control over the data gathering functions, as well as providing data reduction, printout routines, and more extensive artificial traffic generation facilities. The purpose of the measurement effort is to provide insight into network behavior and to support the analytic and simulation modeling work being done at UCLA. In this latter role, the measurements provide a means of verifying, or correcting, models of network behavior by performing appropriate tests in the actual network environment. The result of several such efforts will be discussed."
"A Monte Carlo simulation program that enables the evaluation of different routing policies in a communication network is described. This simulation is intended to deal with nonoriented (telephone) networks and the grade of service (G/S) is taken as the performance measure. However, it can easily be adapted to deal with oriented or mixed networks. The program assigns to each branch of the analyzed network a price function. For each call, the route of minimal cost, among all available under the present load conditions in the network, is then chosen. The program was used for comparing routing policies, as initiated by different price functions. The comparisons were made on several test networks and for different traffic loads. The results obtained showed a significant improvement in the G/S for the policy that aimed at distributing the flow through the network in the most homogenous way possible. This homogenous flow distribution was obtained by using the above minimal-cost policy and a price function, assigned to each channel, that monotonically increases with the traffic load of the branch to which the particular channel belongs. The influence of the topological configuration of the network on the G/S, under equal external demands, was also investigated and the results are given. The way in which the results are printed out enables the simulation program to serve also as a practical and useful tool in the design (or the redesign) of a communication net."
  "The Trans-Canada Telephone System announced on March 8, 1971 that it will build a digital data network across Canada. The probable speeds in service between Montreal, Ottawa, and Calgary will be 2400, 4800, 9600, and 48 000 bits/s. This network will expand to other geographical points within Canada in 1972. At the time of its inauguration it will be Canada's and probably the world's only digital network. Plans are underway to interconnect will the United States at such major gateways as Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, and Vancouver. Customer demands in both countries will affect the timing for the introduction of line switching, packet switching, and additional speeds. Modern transaction handling capability will be available at major network nodes. Clocks will be installed at all major nodes to handle synchronized transmission. Multiplexers and concentrators will be introduced to derive better utilization of private line digital trunks. The error rate performance between any two geographical points is expected to be better than one error in 107bits transmitted. Regenerative repeaters will be utilized at breakout points along the microwave long-haul routes. Newly designed digital transmission systems will be used for long loops instead of conventional techniques."
"A simple analytical model is developed for loops with centralized control, random slot seizure, and fixed slot duration. Slots are assumed to be generated at regular intervals, regardless of whether they are utilized or not, while requests for service at terminals attached to the loop are described by Poisson arrival statistics, For loops used for data collection, mean waiting-line lengths and queue lengths are obtained both at instants when slots are due to arrive and at instants of arrivals of requests for service. Mean waiting times and queueing times are computed and the relative efficiencies of different loop sizes compared. Simultaneous data collection and distribution is also considered and the degradation in data-collection service due to use of resources for data distribution is plotted."
"Dynamic channel assignment in mobile communications systems is able to cope with varying nonuniform spatial user demand. It also readily handles the normal randomness in offered traffic. This study presents system performance data for radio systems having 8, 20, 40, 80, and 120 radio channels available and a radio-channel reuse interval of 4 base-station coverage areas. Data are also presented that compare performance of a 30 radiochannel system with a reuse interval of 3 base stations, a 40 radiochannel system with a reuse interval of 4 base stations, and a 50 radio-channel system with a reuse interval of 5 base stations. The results are obtained from a computer simulation of a onedimensional network laid out along a line. As the number of radio channels available to a communication system increases, the system becomes more efficient in handling the fluctuations in offered traffic. Changing the radio-channel reuse interval also affects the per-channel traffic carried by a dynamic-channel-assignment system."
"A nationwide data network is planned that will employ microwave relay networks for both long-haul and short-haul interconnection. A digital modulation technique has been developed that has the constant level advantage of frequency-shift keying (FSK) systems while retaining the error rate and threshold performance of coherently detected binary or four-phase phase-shift keying (PSK). Occupied spectrum and interference characteristics of a 21.5-Mbit/s data system are compared to the more conventional 600-, 1200-, and 1800-channel message systems."
"This paper presents a complete statistical characterization of the equilibrium storage requirements for a multiserver queue handling messages with exponential length and service time requirements. The distinguishing feature of the model presented here is that messages are assumed to be stored in unpacked form in finite-size buffers. The model approximates situations frequently encountered in communication network design. The optimum data field size per buffer to result in minimum total storage requirements when considering variable message lengths and buffer overhead is noted and an expression for the buffer utilization is derived."
"This paper describes a new phase-shift-keyed/phasemodulation (PSK/PM) scheme, called Interplex, which improves the performance of multichannel telemetry systems by reducing the cross-modulation loss. In the case of two-channel systems, the improvement in data power efficiency relative to a conventional system can be as much as 3 dB. A major feature of Interplex is that it can be implemented with very minor modification of existing conventional PSK/PM systems."
"In the design of a computer network, one of the fundamental considerations is the reliability and availability of the communication paths between all pairs of centers in the network. These characteristics are strongly dependent on the topological layout of the communication links in addition to the reliability and availability of the individual computer systems and communication facilities. Based on graph theoretic models for computer and communication networks, many different reliability measures have been defined. Attempts have been made to characterize networks that are optimal with respect to these measures. In this paper, the most significant reliability criteria and their relevance to different applications will be discussed. Furthermore, we survey the status of current research on the different criteria. The difficulties and limitations on each reliability measure will be pointed out and what seem to be the most fruitful areas for further investigation will be indicated."
"The expendable wire link (XWL) is a new electrical transmission device that permits short-term hard-wire electrical connection to an instrument package being deployed from ship or aircraft. This hard-wire \"link\" is a 0.008-in-diam cable with a weight of less than 4 g/100 ft. With an electrical connection device of this type, closed-circuit telemetry, voice communications, measurement, and sensing devices may be deployed simply and reliably from a variety of moving vessels without the need for associated complex radio or sonar transmitting and receiving equipment. Expendable wire links are operational. Links ten mi in length have been deployed for data transmission, reducing substantially the complexity of interfacing peripheral equipment. The telemetering package remains directly connected to instrumentation aboard the vessel. It is unaffected by the surrounding environment and is independent of the vessel's speed or maneuvering. Presently available are two- and three-conductor, expendable wire links of 0.008- and 0.010-in diam, respectively. Units are fabricated to customer specifications in quantities of from 12 to 10 000."

The peculiarities characteristic of mobile communication include complicated radio propagation and requirements for continuous communication and determination of mobile subscribers' location. This paper discusses major problems of future mobile communication, for example, radio propagation, controlling, and switching and radio equipment involved in meeting the future demands of a large number of subscribers over widespread service areas. Effective use of an electronic switching system will enable the mobile communication network to be integrated with existing fixed communication networks."

"An experimental 50 Mbits/s pulse-code modulation-time-division multiple access (PCM-TDMA) system with time preassignment and time-assignment speech interpolation (TASI) features (called the TTT system) was built for use in a satellite test. This system was designed for application in the INTELSAT IV network and has the channel capacity of more than 700 telephone channels. This capacity can be increased up to twice when pulse-code modulation-time-assignment speech interpolation (PCM-TASI) is adopted. The field test was conducted via INTELSAT III in 1970 and satisfactory results were obtained, which encourages the introduction of the TDMA system for commercial use."
"A new transmission scheme for channels with intersymbol interference named \"matched-transmission (MT) technique\" is proposed. An implementation of the MT system is presented and its relations with conventional techniques are described. It is shown that the partial response scheme is a special case of our new technique. The performance of the MT technique is discussed from the view point of the output signal-to-noise ratio and the system is shown to attain asymptotically the bound performance predicted by the information theory."
"A wide-band optical communication system that modulates the envelope of the carrier of a high-speed optical pulse having no relation to the PCM signals, was developed. This optical pulse is supplied from a He-Ne gas laser oscillator that is controlled to generate a single transversal mode. The transmission bit rate of this optical communication system is 123 Mbits/s, and this system has a transmission capacity of three monochrome video signals, three program signals, and one channel of 48-kHz high-speed facsimile signal or one National Television System Commission (NTSC) color TV signal and one program signal. When this optical communication system is used to propagate through the atmosphere for a distance of 2-3 km, reliability is expected to be 99 percent."
"An experimental guided millimeter-wave transmission system is constructed employing two 806-Mbit/s digital repeaters, an 8.4-km waveguide line loop, and channel coupling networks. This paper presents its characteristics, such as waveforms, amplitude and delay, error rate, and timing jitter in some detail."
"This paper reviews recent progress in communication theory in Japan, mainly in the past three years. The topics to be discussed include 1) waveform transmission in band-limited channels and active transmission lines, 2) source-coding problems such as optimal quantizing characteristics, delta modulation, and linear transformation, 3) transmission codes, where mainly multilevel codes have been discussed, 4) new information transmission and modulation schemes, and 5) theories of traffic and switchingsystem design."
"Japanese coaxial toll systems at the end of the fiscal year 1970 had grown to 29 980 km of coaxial cable (including both tubes of two-tube systems). In the next seven years, 1971 to 1977, the requirement is expected to be three times this capacity. Cable transmission systems fully utilizing modem electronics and communication engineering techniques are being developed to best meet this expected growth and to provide new wider band services."
"Construction of a highly accurate segment companding voice codec is described in this paper. It is shown that an ideal precompressor placed in front of the segment coder enables moderating the accuracy required by 4 times in the 13-segment coder and by 8 times in the 15-segment coder. Two precompressor circuits with a negligible accuracy degradation are proposed and their performances are thoroughly discussed. It is shown that highly accurate sequential feedback segment companding coders, such as the 8-bit 13- or 15-segment coder, can be realized easily with these precompressors."
"Some means of time-slot interchanging is required in a pulse-code-modulation (PCM) transit switching system to satisfy the blocking requirements due to the fact that average trunk loading is high and that the time slots of incoming calls are preassigned at the remote office. This paper presents the use of serial-to-parallel conversion and parallel-to-serial conversion pulse shifters, both having limited time-slot interchange capability at the input and the output of the switching networks, respectively. The features of the system are that the required memory capacity is much smaller than the conventional systems and that serial transmission and parallel switching are possible. The results of optimization through blocking probability evaluation and network cost estimation are also described for networks with one, two, and three gate stages, and with an additional parallel pulse-shifter stage."
"A stored program-controlled electronic switching system (ESS) requires a large-capacity memory to store various kinds of programs and data. This paper describes a hierarchy arrangement including a high-speed memory and a low-cost largecapacity magnetic-drum memory for reduction of the cost of the ESS. The paper also describes the design philosophy, reliability, structure, and evaluation of the system. A magnetic drum with hydrodynamic floating heads (memory capacity:3.7 \\times 10^{7}bits, clock rate: 2.2 MHz) was employed. The magnetic-drum memory system can provide transfer of individual words (each consisting of 41 bits), transfer of variable-length data by flag bit control, and content-addressable access. Furthermore, the system is designed to be most suitable for transfer of the large amount of data required by the switching system. The data throughput of the magnetic-drum memory system is 210 kbytes/s in a burst mode. The mean time between failures (MTBF) of the system is approximately3.5 \\times 10^{3}h. This system assures reliability required for the ESS and high performance for application of the ESS to stored data switching as well as telephone switching."

"Methods of synchronization for an unknown signal sequence by learning procedure, which computes a posteriori probabilities for the signal location, are presented. First, to avoid the difficulties of the interference between successive intervals, a signal sequence with ample guard spaces for getting rid of the interference is treated. Next, the case without guard space is treated. To the nonsupervised case, some methods are applied. The methods proposed in this paper have a form of double learning with respect to the unknown signal form and the signal location. Also some results of computer simulation are presented."
"An approximate queueing model for common-channel signaling systems has been developed and the queueing-delay distribution has been obtained. As a special case, the approximate average queueing-delay formula for common-channel signaling systems has been derived. By simulation, it has been ascertained that this formula is reasonably accurate."
"In a high-speed digital radio relay system with four-phase-shift keying and coherent detection, it is very important to realize an accurate, stable, and wide-band carrier synchronizer. In this paper, the influence of time delay causing trouble for the wide-band synchronizer realization is analyzed. Then the design procedure of this synchronizer is described. Finally, the realizability of such a synchronizer is proved by the experimental results at a 1.7-GHz intermediate frequency and a 200-MHz clock frequency."
"A recently introduced large-size commercially available electronic switching system has versatility in application to different hierarchies of switching stages and is available not only in the telephone systems, but for forthcoming new telecommunication services such as video telecommunications, data applications, mobile radio telephones, etc. Successive developmental programs are now in progress for remote control switching systems, a small-medium-size electronic switching system and data-switching systems. In the international telecommunication field, an electronic telegraph switching system has been completed and electronic telex and telephone switching systems and a data-switching system are now under development. This paper describes some features of various electronic switching systems available in Japan for domestic and international telecommunications."
"Systems are currently being designed for higher reliability and greater economy. Larger transmission capacity is required to meet a rapid increase in recent communication demands instigated by the introduction of video and information communications facilities. More flexibility, to deal with the variety of communication modes to come, and smaller hardware dimensions, to overcome situations caused by the high population density, seem to be particularly sought in the communication technology of Japan. Research and development concentrate on these objectives. The following is an explanation of the present state of the art and general trends in this country."
"This paper describes recent research and development of satellite communication technology in Japan together with the future prospects. Newly developed earth station facilities for both commercial and experimental purposes are described first. New satellite communication systems, such as STAR, SMAX, TTT, SSB-PM, and SSRA, which originated and/or have been studied extensively in Japan, are described briefly. Recent developments of microwave and millimeter-wave antennas, parametric amplifiers, high-power tubes, etc., are surveyed. Brief descriptions are also given of radio-wave propagation studies and development plans for Japanese communication satellites."
"This paper describes an audio response unit used in data communication services. The speech segments necessary to respond are stored in a large capacity magnetic drum in terms of partial autocorrelation (PARCOR) coefficients and excitation source information. PARCOR coefficient is a new parameter to express accurately the spectrum envelope of speech signals. Multiple speech signals can be synthesized simultaneously by means of a timemultiplexed digital filter composed of a high-speed arithmetic unit. The unit is able to respond to more than 7000 speech segments of 1-s duration."
"This paper describes a new teleprinter that can print graphs as well as characters through the combination of anX-Yplotter using a high-speed incremental servo with a large-scale integration (LSI) character pattern memory that converts telegraphic signals into plotter signals. This device prints 20 characters per second, and the characters are formed by connecting segment vectors in eight different directions with one stroke. Design criteria of the incremental drive system and the selection of the symbol font are also described."
"This paper reviews the status of research and development in both microwave radio-relay systems and millimeter-wave transmission systems as well as the technical features in these fields, mainly developed under the auspices of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (NTT). Recent activities have been the development of new solid-state devices and high-capacity systems. The application of solid-state techniques is being extended to systems of both analog and digital transmission, such as the 2700 multichannel telephone transmission system in frequency division multiplexing (FDM)-FM radio-relay system, an experimental 20-GHz PCM radio-relay system capable of 400 Mbits/s pulse transmission, and a guided millimeter-wave system of 800-Mbit/s transmission at 40-80 GHz. The microwave integrated circuit (MIC) is also becoming very important in utilizing these high-frequency regions, which should be a valuable resource in the future when a vast information transmission capability will be required."
"Aspects of data communications in Japan are broadly summarized in this paper. First, various networks for data communication are described and some examples of data communication services using these networks are mentioned. Next, some topics in data communication technology are outlined. Topics include two large-scale computer projects and R&D on pattern recognition techniques in the data-processing field, standard modems now in use and new modems for PCM transmission and other uses in the data transmission field, optical character readers (OCR) and an audio-response unit, as well as various printers in the data terminal equipment field."
"This paper reviews research and developmental activities in optical communications currently under way in Japan. Three major systems: 1) atmospheric optical communication systems, 2) optical-cable systems, and 3) lens-waveguide systems, using various types of lasers and newly developed optical devices and components, have been extensively studied at the Electrical Communication Laboratories of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) and other electronic manufacturing companies in Japan."

"In a recent correction [2] to previous correspondence [1] it was stated that 3) of the theorem in [1] was invalid due to the statistical dependence of the yi. The joint distribution function of the yiis derived below confirming their dependence, but also upholding the validity of Item 3. Furthermore, an exact goodness of fit test for the Rayleigh distribution based upon theN + 1observationsx_{1}, ... , x_{N+1}is suggested."

"A new technique for designing a general class of time-division-multiplexed (TDM) connecting networks is presented. The technique is based on an equivalence transformation operating on a pure space-division network. The methods developed can be used for generating networks that are rearrangeable, conditionally nonblocking or strictly nonblocking. A first-degree TDM network is derived using vertical multiplexing on a pure space Clos network. Analytic equations are presented describing the number of cross-points as well as the distribution of fixed delay elements. A second-degree TDM network is formed by extending the multiplexing scheme an additional degree. The resulting network can be horizontally multiplexed to produce a compact and efficient TDM structure."
"Signal interaction is analyzed when the composite signal of a simultaneously amplitude- and angle-modulated wave, a nonmodulated sinusoidal wave, and a noise is added to a half-wave linear mixer. If a certain mixing condition is satisfied, a half-wave linear mixer operates like an ideal bandpass limiter with frequency conversion function. The limiter action is also verified by experiment."
 "Over the past years, a considerable number of electronic test facilities have been converted to automatic test systems (ATE)."
"The classical approach of considering intersymbol interference as a modulation problem is replaced by less conventional information decoding considerations. We present the concept of viewing time-dispersive channels as natural convolutional encoders. Several channels are presented as examples and computer simulations exhibit some of the benefits."
"The effect of the integration interval in an integrate and dump detector in a band-limited system is analyzed. It is found for optimum performance that the interval must be delayed by τ seconds, which can be approximated by finding the interval giving maximum area under the system pulse response."
"An expression is given for the power spectrum of continuous-phase FSK signals when the baseband signal is split-phase (Manchester) coded and representative plots are presented."
"Timing extraction through nonlinearity in the presence of pulse overlaps is studied for baseband PCM or PAM systems. It is shown that the systematic jitter can be reduced by proper choices of nonlinearity, coding scheme, and pulse waveform. Discussions on choice of nonlinearity indicate that square-law rectification is desirable for elimination of jitter sources. This nonlinearity derives a frequency-domain expression for amplitude and phase of the timing wave that separates the effects of pulse pattern and pulse shapes and provides insight to their contributions to timing jitter. Proper choices of coding scheme and pulse waveform reduce amplitude and phase variation in the timing wave. For example, an optimum prefiltering (or correlative coding) reduces amplitude variation to one eighth for bipolar sequence. In the case of symmetrical reshaping by a Bessel (flat delay) filter, the maximum jitter exceeds 20 degrees if the order of a filter is less than ten. An asymmetrical reshaping makes the maximum jitter less than four degrees for the same order of filter. Some features of nonlinearities that approximate square-law rectification are discussed."
"The problem of equalizing a discrete signal that has been transmitted through a channel selected at random from an ensemble of channels is considered. Using mean-square error as the performance index, the minimum number of adjustable parameters required to achieve a given level of performance is sought. For certain special cases, it is shown that, using nonrecursive sampled data filters, the optimum tap weights are given by the eigenvectors of the matrix formed from the covariances of the channel's impulse response. A numerical algorithm is developed to find the optimum equalizer structure for a wide class of channels with the restriction that the number of channels in the given ensemble is finite. Results worked out for several examples show that the optimum equalizer structure requires significantly fewer adjustable parameters than the standard transversal equalizer in order to obtain the same level of performance."
"This paper investigates the detail capabilities and performance characterization of systems that employL-orthogonal signaling techniques.L-orthogonal signals represent a unified set of signals wherein the polyphase and orthogonal (biorthogonal) signal sets are included as special cases. This fact is important since orthogonal (biorthogonal) and polyphase signaling sets represent opposing forces as far as tradeoffs between error probability, energy-to-noise ratio, and bandwidth requirements are concerned. Bounds on the performance of the optimum receiver and the performance of various suboptimum (practical) receiver structures are given. Coherent and differentially encoded signals are also pursued. Various comparisons and tradeoffs are made by means of numerical evaluation of the error-probability expressions."
"There are many instances in communication systems where bandpass signals are passed through nonlinear devices, such as traveling wave tubes, which exhibit both amplitude and phase nonlinearities. When the input signal is narrow band, the device may be characterized by measurements of its single-carrier amplitude and phase transfer functions. A sufficient model for such a device is a quadrature structure that includes two nonlinearities each of which, acting on its own, would exhibit only amplitude distortion. The outputs of the two halves of this model are linearly independent for arbitrary narrow-band input signals so that their power spectra add. Consequently, almost all previously published results for amplitude nonlinearities can be readily applied to the analysis of the general device. Emphasis is laid on practical procedures for analysis based directly on measured device characteristics rather than analytic approximations and accuracy is checked by comparison of certain intermodulation results with previous results and with measurements. A new result is the performance of an Intelsat IV tube for a large number of independent equal-power-density signals. A heuristically optimal saturating nonlinearity is introduced and analyzed and two methods of compensating an arbitrary saturating device to obtain this optimal characteristic are presented. Two methods of inverting the Chebyshev transform are used in this paper and the choice of basis functions for obtaining series representations of the measured device characteristics is discussed."
"This paper examines the performance of a two-link digital communication system operating in the presence of Gaussian noise on both links when bandpass limiters are inserted into the system. The product of the signal time duration and the noise bandwidth for the systems under consideration is small. It is concluded that under certain conditions, the presence of a limiter can improve the performance of the system. Also, a simplification of previous work is presented when an infinite clipper is introduced at baseband in the detector."
"This paper describes an automatic test system for factory testing of telephone carrier equipment channel units. The system is intended for high volume subassemblies such as those found in pulse-code-modulation carrier systems where, typically, there are 24 units in each terminal. With the greater availability of minicomputers and digitally programmable instruments, a system is feasible at moderate cost. The system described uses a low-cost self-contained eight-bit minicomputer as the test sequence controller. Control information is transmitted to and from the various instruments by way of a data input-output buffer. A reed contact switching matrix is used to interconnect commercial equipment that is used to generate inputs and measure results. The resulting system is capable of making up to 100 functional tests on a channel unit in less than one minute. Significant savings have been possible in testing time and labor cost. Also, equipment reliability is improved because of uniform testing methods."
"A model is developed to estimate the passage time of a block of data through a group of tandem buffered switches of a buffered data network. In particular, the first two moments and the distribution function of this block passage time are estimated. This estimation procedure contains many assumptions and heuristic arguments that are based on the author's intuition and/or experience. Simulation results of the block passage time through a sample buffered network are presented and are compared with the results of the estimation procedure. The delay performance of this example buffered network is also studied by making a delay comparison between the sample buffered network and a point-to-point private-line arrangement."
"The relationship between intersatellite spacing, error probability, and carrier-to-thermal noise ratio is studied for the case where the satellites transmit multilevel coherent phase-shift-keyed signals. Numerical results based on computer evaluation of exact expressions are presented for 2-, 4-, 8-, and 16-phase systems."
"The video-signal bandwidth reduction obtained by interframe differential transmission is hindered by rapid movements of the objects and the camera. A simple movement compensation procedure can be obtained by dividing the image into zones and then transmitting for each zone a displacement vector relating the zone to a zone in the previous flame that is maximally correlated with it. The effectiveness of such a procedure is studied on a model of the random video process, obtained as a derivation of a three-dimensional telegraph signal. In particular, it is shown that for this model, the optimal procedure for finding the most correlated zone in the previous frame is the one matching the intersections of the contour lines. The optimal size of the zone for which a single displacement vector has to be transmitted is also determined."
"Word synchronization in PCM of TV signals is more important than that of audio signals, since often a single channel of TV signals is transmitted independently. For this purpose, new word synchronization is proposed, where the statistical property of TV signals is utilized instead of adding a bit for synchronization. The property is that a more significant bit in PCM does not change word by word as frequently as a less significant bit, because of the correlation between adjacent picture elements, i.e., sampled values or words. Mathematical calculation shows that the average time between misframes is as long as 104years and the average recovery time is less than several lines when a 4-bit reversible counter for synchronization is used in transmitting 500-kHz narrow-band TV-phone signals."
"A feedback policy, denoted the \"new-word policy,\" is described that permits reduction in the required number of repeats compared to the method commonly proposed. An expression is derived comparing the average number of transmissions required per new word."
"A scrambling property of binary feedback shift registers is investigated. When the input sequence has a certain defined randomness, the output symbols are uncorrelated everywhere, except possibly at symbol separations that are integer multiples of the exponent of the feedback polynomial. At those points the output autocorrelation is shown to be equal to higher order moments of the input sequence."
"Conventional space diversity reception at typical elevated base locations requites separation of 30λ for broadside incidence and even more for in-line incidence and is therefore difficult to implement. A polarization diversity system for mobile radio is proposed. This is a two-branch receiver diversity system with the advantage that the base station antennas can be spaced as closely as desired. An experimental program has been carried out to obtain the statistical properties of vertically and horizontally polarized electromagnetic waves in a suburban environment at 836 MHz. It was observed that signals of both polarizations were Rayleigh plus log normal, where one is uncorrelated and other is correlated irrespective of base or mobile antenna spacings. The local means of the two signals were highly correlated and were with ± 3 dB for almost 90 percent of the time. Variation of base transmitter heights appeared to have little effect on the ratio of the local means of the two signals. The analysis and experiment demonstrated the feasibility of providing two diversity branches at UHF by polarization diversity."
"The statistical dependence (redundancy) between three differentially coded color components of a video-telephone signal are explored by means of an entropy study. We measure the entropy of the differentially coded color baseband signals both jointly and as three separate signals. The source material consisted of a number of portraittype pictures. The color signal is treated in a format containing a baseband luminance channel and two baseband chrominance channels. Various orthogonal and nonorthogonal transformations, including the Karhunen-Loève transform, are applied to the chrominance signals to study the effect on the entropy. With a well-chosen format for the color signal, our results show that the redundancy resulting from using a separate encoding of the signals rather than a joint encoding ranges between 0.2 and 0.5 bits. The possible savings accruing from considering the relationship between coded color differential components was only about 1 percent of the total bit rate for most pictures and increased to a maximum of 4 percent for one particular picture."
"Telephone lines may be protected from lightning-induced surges by gas-tube lightning arresters. Typical arresters break down at 250-400 V dc. Breakdown voltage increases with the rate of rise of the applied voltage and may be two or three times the dc value at a rate of rise of 10 kV/μs. Lightning surges on telephone lines approach this rate of rise. The circuit described in this paper generates and measures ramps with linear rates of rise from 0.5 to 10 kV/μs chopped at 500-1500 V. In order to achieve ramp linearity and to minimize oscillations after the chop, stray capacitances and inductances must be made as small as possible. Construction and layout required to achieve this are described in some detail and typical test oscillograms at 0.5 and 10 kV/μs are presented in corroboration. Measurement accuracy is analyzed and maximum errors are estimated to be, for breakdown voltage, 3 and 10 percent at 0.5 and 10 kV/μs, respectively; and for rate of rise, 5 percent for all ramps. If greater accuracy is required, it can be obtained by correction for divider time constant errors and by further study of carbon resistor voltage coefficients."
"Conferencing in three-stage nonblocking switching networks is investigated. Clos's results are extended to consider networks in which conference connections are made at the cross points rather than through the use of separate conference bridges. If conferencing is allowed only in the center stage, it is shown that the cross-point count is multiplied by approximatelyk/2, wherekis the number of conferees (for normal calls,k = 2). If conferencing is allowed in all stages, then it is shown that the Clos nonblocking network is conference nonblocking for arbitrarily large conferences. Similar results for Bowers' folded networks are also presented."
"This study considers the message propagation problem in a \"net-alert\" situation through directed and undirected random networks havingnnodes and probability of connection between the distinct pairs of nodes equal top. The solution has been obtained by analyzing the structure of the random networks in terms of the probability distribution of the number of contacted new nodes, which are separated from the originator(s) of the message by simple chain progressions ofklinks. From these probability distributions, the average message propagation, the weak connectivity, and thekth terminal reliability are obtained. To aid the computation of these quantities first-order difference equations that approximate the average message propagation, the weak connectivity, and thekth terminal reliability are given. The application of the results is shown for random networks having several values ofnandp."
"This paper examines the performance of a digital communication system operating in the presence of additive Gaussian noise when a bandpass hard limiter is inserted into the system. In contrast with earlier published work for large time-bandwidth product systems, small signal-time-duration-noise-bandwidth products at large SNR's are considered. It is found that the degradation introduced by the limiter is more severe under these conditions."
"Upper and lower bounds on the spectral density of a sinusoidal carrier frequency modulated by a band-limited Gaussian noise signal are derived and we show that these bounds are very close to each other if the ratio of the rms frequency deviation to the maximum modulating frequency is even moderately high. We then show that the results obtained from the quasi-static approximation, often used in such cases, are too small for largefand that this low-frequency approximation cannot be used in cases where the behavior on the tails is of importance."
"A laser communication system, which has an automatic acquisition and tracking capability without the aid of any other communication link, has been constructed and experimented. It consists of two terminals that can transmit one TV signal and error signals for tracking each other. The heart of this system is a combination of a laser, a position sensor, an angle detector, and an optical deflector that can send back a laser beam parallel to an incident beam as if it were a retroreflector. The availability of this system was proved from a transmission experiment at the distance of 500 m. The maximum propagation distance of this system is estimated to be 1 km if a 200-mm diameter receiving aperture is used, even though there are spot dancing and beam spreads."
"This paper concerns itself with the design of an algorithm that will shorten the training period and adaptation time of an adaptive equalizer. Time-invariant or slowly varying channels with white additive Gaussian noise are considered. An adaptive equalizer in the form of a nonrecursive transversal filter reduces the intersymbol interference. The training period consists of the transmission of isolated pulses between which the equalizer is adjusted. The algorithm uses a minimum mean-squared error criterion with a variable step size on each iteration. A fixed number of iterations is allowed for the error to be minimized. A constraint related to the average excess mean-squared error is included, and the set of step sizes is determined by invoking the principle of optimality in dynamic programming. The resulting algorithm is compared to the popular fixed step-size algorithm. Predicted and experimental results are given. A fairly well conditioned and a poorly conditioned channel are considered. Results show that the new algorithm has a faster adaptation time. It is more complex than the fixed step-size algorithm, but for long transversal filters requires little additional computation time."
"New methods of parallel and serial synchronization for time-multiplexed signals are presented. In the parallel case, i.e., when the sync code is transmitted on a separate channel,Msynchronization codes are generated by concatenating (in the sense used in concatenated codes) a common pn-like sequence of short length with words from a self-synchronizable code. The frame synchronizer can lock on any of theMcodes, which is particularly useful when frames of different lengths have to be transmitted. In the serial case, that is when each frame starts with an identical sync code, false sync due to replicas of the code, randomly generated by the data, is completely eliminated by transferring the sync code to the quadrature channel, while the data are transmitted on the inphase channel."
  "Modeling the occurrence times as a Poisson process, the spectrum of a carrier frequency modulated by a random pulse train is studied. In general, the corresponding phase modulation is nonstationary, but the modulated carrier is shown to be wide-sense stationary, so that its RF spectrum can be obtained as the Fourier transform of its correlation function. Closed-form asymptotic results show that RF spectrum is proportional to ω-4if the frequency modulation is discontinuous, and as ω-6if it is continuous, where ω is the radian frequency measured from the carrier frequency. Numerically evaluated spectra are obtained for the particular case of a stationary tone-burst modulation, a form used in a proposed mobile-radio feedback diversity system. These results show that even for modulation indices as small as 0.5, the spectrum of the tone bursts themselves is not a good approximation to the RF spectrum. Finally, the spectral broadening caused by adding tone-burst modulation to a carrier already modulated by a flat-band Gaussian process is evaluated numerically. These results show that the modulation index of the bursts should be kept to unity or less in order to restrict the spectral broadening to 10 percent or less if the rms phase deviation of the Gaussian modulation is less than three radians."
"It is shown that the source statistics influence the form of the decision threshold in an optimum receiver. For a first-order Markov source, a simple suboptimum realization is a hysteresis loop. The performance improvement over the single threshold decision rule is modest but in some cases it is possible to cut the Pein half. One case where decision hysteresis performs best is in a modem that uses split phase or data scrambling to ensure that the transmitted signal tends to alternate. As a practical matter, it turns out that hysteresis can do more damage than good if the signal-to-noise ratio is variable."
"This paper discusses two aspects of the performance and design of certain queued or buffered information transmission systems. Examples are buffered multiplexers and message-switching systems. The first part of the paper examines the theoretical performance of such a system as its output channel capacity and the number of its speed-limited information sources are increased proportionately. The aspects of performance considered are time delay and probability of overflow of the system's finite buffer capacity. Under the assumptions made (described in the text), system performance almost always improves as the size of the system is increased. The second portion of the paper considers the design of a communication system that must serve two classes of users, the two classes differing in average message length. Here the question is that of superiority of integrated or segregated communication system design under a channel-capacity constraint. Using average delay as a performance criterion it is shown that the integrated system is not always superior but becomes superior if there is sufficient excess capacity."
"In above-threshold communication situations, the estimation bias and hence the modulation suppression are practically negligible; so that the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is numerically very close to the reciprocal of the normalized mean-square error (MSE). The two last performance measures are, however, conceptually distinct as well as numerically widely different below threshold. Whereas in estimation and control problems the latter is of primary interest, much effort having been invested in its calculation and bounding, the former is very often more meaningful when transmitting sampled continuous data. This paper purports to review the relations between the previously mentioned quantities in time-discrete communications; to conjecture a functional dependence of bias and MSE on the value of the transmitted parameter, that simplifies these relations; to present some results of a Monte-Carlo simulation that tests these conjectures and provides performance curves for the maximum a posteriori probability, the (minimum-MSE-optimal) conditional mean and other derived estimators; and finally to speculate about the relative merits of these averaging type estimators as compared with the discriminator types in a frequency-position-modulation system, from the point of view of the aural character of the output noise below threshold."
"A brief description is presented of why the power utilities need communication during faults. Wire communication channels can supply this need when suitably protected. The maximum groundpotential rise is needed to select protective equipment. How this transient voltage is generated with its wave shape and duration is explained for a single phase-to-ground fault on a power system. The peak occurs at about one-half cycle time at power frequency following a fault at the critical moment, with a magnitude determined by theXtoRratio. A possibility exists that an even higher voltage results when a phase-to-ground fault changes to a two-phase-to-ground fault after about\\frac{1}{3}cycle delay."
"This paper presents a numerical technique for the solution of a class of queueing problems having fixed priority assignment, synchronous service, constant service time, and finite number of sources. The analysis yields waiting-time distributions, namely, the probabilities of waiting exactlynWservice cycles or longer. It applies to scanners, multiplexer channels, loop configurations, etc. It is especially useful for worst case design in that it permits the calculation of overflow probabilities. Results are given in the form of curves and are compared with those for exponential service times. A priority scheme is outlined that allows partial elimination of the geometrical priorities inherent to loop multiplexers."
"The performance of differential PCM encoders used for both speech and data signals is investigated. Primarily concerned with data signals, this paper shows how differential PCM systems designed for speech perform with differential-phase-modulation, single sideband and partial response data signals operating at data rates of 1200-9600 bits/s. The seven signals considered in this study are shown in Table I. Also discussed are compromise differential PCM systems, which operate well for either speech or data but which are not optimum for either. These results show the advantages and limitations of using differential PCM on switched telecommunication networks carrying speech and data. This paper contains results generated by theoretical studies, computer simulation, and experiments with hardware encoders and modems."
"The phase-slipping behavior of second-order squaring and quadrupling phase-locked loop configurations is investigated by digital computer simulation. Statistics are obtained for the mean time between batches of phase slips and the duration of the batches, as a function of the effective loop signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)."

  "The theory of operation and the design of an all-digital FM discriminator is presented in this paper. It is shown that the digital discriminator is equivalent to the Foster-Seely demodulator, i.e., a discriminator that converts the FM signal into an AM signal and then recovers the AM by using envelope detection. The output signal-to-noise ratio is found analytically above and below threshold and the results are verified experimentally. The theoretical analysis includes the effect of quantization noise, frequency jitter in the internal oscillator, and thermal noise. The system can be integrated and with the use of readily available emitter-coupled logic (ECL) can operate at intermediate frequencies suitable for many space, industrial, and commercial applications."
"The effect of mutual coupling on a space diversity combined signal from an optimum resistive load network lessens when the antenna spacingdand the number of elementsMincrease. Whendis greater than 0.2λ, the cumulative distribution curves of anM-branch signal with mutual effects included show only a small difference compared to an array with no coupling, and are close to the cumulative distribution curve of an array withMindependent branches. For the average SNR of an array with 100 branches obtained from an optimum resistive load network to be within -3 dB of the SNR from independent branches the required antenna spacing is at least 0.25λ, for an in-line array and 0.5λ, for a planar array. Since a planar array is much smaller than an in-line array for equal performance, the planar array is a more desirable configuration."
"The full-carrier single-sideband signal is of the minimal phase type with limited phase excursion and contains sufficient information to recover completely the message waveform. A receiving system is described that makes use of both the envelope and the phase information in the signal. Operation is independent of input signal level and requires no wide-band quadrature network."
"Procedures are developed and illustrated by application to real usage data of analysis of variance techniques for measuring components of variance in the data due to trend and arbitrary random variability in usage of equipment in a group as a whole. The usage data are obtained by periodic scanning of the equipment group at fixed intervals. Procedures for fitting the Polya distribution to the data are presented. Fitted Polya distributions are used to estimate the effects of trend on blocking. The procedures are extended to measuring and estimating the effects on blocking of day-to-day traffic variation and are illustrated by application to real usage data. A procedure is presented for adjusting estimates of variance for autocorrelation due to the usage measurement procedure and call holding times. The adjustment procedure is based on incomplete research and is, therefore, tentative. The effects of using a variance-stabilizing transformation of the data are shown. Other areas of application of the theory and procedures are discussed."
"A class of \"optimum\" phase modulation (PM) system treated in the past is one wherein a sinusoidal carrier is phase modulated linearly by a Gaussian (baseband) random process and demodulation is performed by a phase-locked loop (PLL). This paper is concerned with PM systems in which the phase modulation is allowed to be nonlinear. In practice, most phase modulators are restricted to finite ranges of linear operations. The performance (SNR) of the PLL demodulator is degraded when the linear range is exceeded by an amplitude of the modulating waveform. The occurrence of performance degradation is a random event whose frequency depends on the linear range and the statistics of the waveform amplitude. By interpreting the nonlinear phase modulation as a saturation phenomenon, we determine in this paper the performances of PLL de modulator as a function of varying degree of saturation (or limiting) level for several cases of baseband spectrums. We model the \"saturation\" by an error function limiter. Our results are general, and it is shown that the previous results of linear modulations are special cases of our results. We then move on to assume that the baseband waveform is a composite signal of multichannel frequency division multiplexed (FDM) signals. As a result, we compute the lower bounds of slgnal-to-crosstalk power ratio for several cases of baseband spectrums."
"This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the distortion of the dial pulse waveform and its effects on the response characteristics of the pulse-receiving circuit in the telephone office. To derive expressions for the waveform for dial speeds of 10 and 20 pulses per second (pps) Laplace transformation and matrix algebra are applied to the system, represented by two complementary linear lumped-constant time-invariant networks responsible for the generation of the leading and trailing edges of a dial pulse. Based on the known waveform and the operational requirements of the pulse-receiving circuit, a function is derived showing the percent break value of a pulse train as it arrives at the central office, and the dependence of the percent break on the number of extension (branch) telephones connected and the subscribers' loop parameters. Its inverse, shown in graphical form, presents the upper limits for the number of extensions to be associated with a transmission line of given electrical parameters. The conditions under which abrupt changes of the percent break value and quasi-pulses occur are analyzed."
"The Hilbert transform has found application in the analysis of single-sideband signals and angle modulation in communication systems. This extensive tabulation of this transform should prove handy for engineers as much as the more popular Laplace transform tabulations. Such a comprehensive listing of Hilbert transforms is not available in any published work so far."
"Bipolar signal waveforms for digital communication are normally accomplished by coding the message sequence first and then pulse shaping the bipolar signal. The coding is relatively simple to mechanize; the pulse shaping may present some difficulty and approximation techniques may have to be used. A hybrid digital-analog mechanization of a bipolar signal waveform generator in which the bipolar encoding and pulse-shaping operations are combined is described."
"This paper presents the results of a statistical analysis of diversity combining systems. Previous theoretical work on this topic often assumes that the input signals are jointly Rayleigh distributed, which may not hold for a practical fading environment. In this paper, we use a new formulation and analysis to show that the major results of previous theoretical work are actually valid without the restrictive assumption of a joint Rayleigh distribution. The statistics include the probability of fade, the expected number of fades per unit time, and the average fade duration. We also extend the analysis to include the effect of a dominant interfering signal such as the water-reflected ray of an overwater radio link. The statistics of diversity signals on these radio links are different and are not treated in the literature."
"The results of an investigation of the feasibility of using passive space arrays as highly efficient signal reflectors is reported. The design selected as having the maximum efficiency in terms of the ratio of the signal energy reflected in the required direction to the weight of the space array is a gravity gradient stabilized planar array of dipoles connected and supported by lightweight dielectric filaments. The system and space array parameters required to give a high capacity system output are examined together with the flexibility of the system parameters and operations. This analysis is to determine if a high-capacity space array system can be designed with a potential capability to operate with small stations in both the transmit and receive modes; to achieve significant improvements in spectrum utilization over that achieved in conventional active satellites; and to provide accurate position information. The status of the investigation and the need for additional experimental programs are also discussed. The Appendixes are on signal processing for the space arrays, dipole arrays as reflectors for active satellites or ground antenna systems, and space grating arrays to relay optical signals."
"Lower bounds are given on the attainable mean-square performance in causally tracking the phase and frequency of a subcarrier that modulates an optical carrier in a direct-detection opticalcommunication system."
"Any digital communication system that employs coherent detection requires coherent reference signals for proper operation. This paper is concerned with the transmission and detection of differentially encoded multiple phase-shift-keyed (MPSK) signals and the ambiguity resolution problem that results from suppression of the transmitted carrier. In particular, the paper presents the analysis and performance of differentially encoded coherent MPSK systems that reconstruct coherent reference signals by means of generalized Costas orNth power loops. The performance of such systems is then compared with that of ideal reception of MPSK signals and differentially coherent detection of differentially encoded MPSK signals. Emphasis is placed upon the special cases of quadriphase and octaphase signaling."
"Many applications of the bandpass limiter involve either coherent or noncoherent demodulation following the limiter. In this paper we study the performance of a noncoherent frequency-shift keying (FSK) receiver when it is preceded by a bandpass limiter. In particular, we obtain expressions for signal suppression- factor, output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and error probability from which one can assess the degradation in performance of the receiver due to the presence of the limiter. Both narrow-band and wide-band cases are treated thus covering situations where no frequency uncertainty exists (i.e., known carrier frequency) as well as large-frequency uncertainties. Also discussed is the first-order signal plus noise probability density function (pdf) following noncoherent demodulation."
"We analyze the locking properties of a digital rate-locked loop that may be used to synchronize a slave oscillator with a master. Formulating the dynamics of this system by a nonlinear differentialintegral equation, we rigorously prove that in the absence of filtering in the loop the slave oscillator output waveform has periodic zero crossings occurring at exactly the same rate as those of the master oscillator. The main requirement for this is only that the quantization of the staircase comparator in the slave oscillator not be too coarse. A similar proof for a more general loop remains elusive."
"A hybrid transformer is used to couple simultaneously both a transmitter and a receiver to the same end of a telephone line with minimum crosstalk. Under ideal circumstances the transformer provides a cancellation signal at the input terminals of the receiver to exactly cancel the signal induced by the local transmitter. This paper describes a simple electronic device that closely behaves as a hybrid transformer operating under ideal conditions. Rejection on dial-up lines is between 50-80 dB. Adaption time is on the order of 50 ms."
"The problem of detection of a sinusoidal signal in the presence of white Gaussian noise and an interfering sinusoid at a nearby frequency is discussed. In the case of coherent detection, several possible receivers are analyzed and probability of error curves are calculated. In some cases it is possible to reduce the effect of cochannel interference significantly by proper choice of a receiver. In the case of incoherent detection, error probability curves have been calculated for the standard envelope detector for several values of frequency separation. The performance of the envelope detector can be degraded substantially by the presence of an interfering sinusoid."
"We describe a technique for jointly encoding the rasterscan sync and data framing information for digital TV phone systems in which synchronous sampling is employed for picture encoding. The technique yields: 1) fast acquisition and hard locking synchronization; 2) highly stable picture displays; and 3) reduced channel capacity requirements."
"An echo suppressor that is composed solely of digital logic circuits and based on a digital voice detector [1] has been designed. The unit is simple and requires no adjustment. Its basic application is to the SPADE [2] PCM channel, although it can be adapted to work with other systems. Results of initial subjective tests are included."
"A nonlinear analysis which can be used to assess certain statistical characteristics of double-loop tracking systems is presented. It takes into account the mutual coupling effects of the loops in the system. Two approaches are taken to obtain steady-state probability density functions (pdf's) of the system phase errors, φ1and φ2From these pdf's, important system performance statistics, e.g., the phaseerror variances, can be calculated, thus illustrating the application and usefulness of the analysis. The analysis is applied to a satellite transponder as an example."
"The theory of time-limited functions with minimum out-of-band energy is extended to apply to functions whose amplitude is held constant and hence, are limited to phase modulation. In the absence of the amplitude constraint, the desired functions are prolate spheroidal functions of time, of order zero, with time-bandwidth product as a parameter. With the amplitude constraint, the desired functions can be expressed in terms of sums of even-order prolate spheroidal functions. An algorithm suitable for computations of the amplitude constrained functions is derived."
"Most receivers for multilevel pulse-code modulation (PCM) signals incorporate a sample-and-hold circuit in the analog-analog-to-digital converter. The sample-and-hold circuits cannot respond instantaneously in practice, and this paper considers the effects on system performance of their finite response time. To provide guidelines for system designers, the problem is analyzed in some generality and numerical results are obtained for a specific example. It is shown that a definite tradeoff exists between the bandwidth of the operational amplifiers in the sample-and-hold circuit and the follow time, and that system performance deteriorates rapidly if the bandwidth is reduced past a certain critical value. Unless the bandwidth is much larger than the critical value, there is a strong advantage in using follow times larger than onehalf the symbol interval. The bandwidth required for good eight-level transmission is about twice that required for binary transmission."
"In digital transmission of binary (+1,-1) signals it is desirable that the stream of pulses which constitutes the signal have no dc, that is, that the power spectrum go to zero at zero frequency. It is desirable that, for a given efficiency or entropy, the spectrum rise slowly with increasing frequency. We have obtained the spectrum for selected blocks with equal numbers of plus ones and minus ones. For a given efficiency, this is better than the spectrum obtained by Rice, using the Monte Carlo method, for block encoding using polarity pulses. An algorithm given by Schalwijk should allow simple encoding into selected blocks."
"The Gram-Charlier series representation of the noiseprobability density function is used to determine an optimum detector for signals in non-Gaussian but near-Gaussian (NGNG) noise. Solutions are obtained for coherent and incoherent detection. Optimal detectors for several typical transmitting systems are determined. Generally these detectors consist of the standard detector for Gaussian noise with the addition of a few, not too sophisticated, nonlinear elements. The performance of a detector, specified by the upper bound on the probability of error, is assessed and is seen to depend on the signal shape, the time-bandwidth product, and the signal-to-noise ratio. The optimal signal to minimize the probability of error is determined and is seen to result as a solution to Duffing's second-order nonlinear differential equation."
"Theoretical analysis of the phase-jitter problem for a vestigial sideband (VSB) or single sideband (SSB) high-speed data transmission system is discussed in detail in this paper. Particular attention is paid to the effect of the phase shift introduced to the phase-jitter sideband components by various circuits in the carrier recovery system. Based on this theoretical analysis, a practical carrier recovery system, which will extract the phase jitter with minimum phase shift introduced to the phase-jitter sideband components, is proposed so that the overall effect of the phase jitter on the demodulated signal will be minimized."
  "This paper describes a theoretical comparison of the noise immunity of direct-detection binary single-channel with direct-detection binary twin-channel optical digital communication systems. The conclusion is that a simple ON-OFF single-channel system is usually superior to twin-channel systems (such as polarization modulation and differentially coherent phase-shift systems) in noise immunity as well as simplicity. This result is quite different from the radio frequency case where twin-channel systems exhibit up to 6-dB advantage relative to single-channel systems."

"A method has been proposed for the optimization of a static system with respect to an objective function which is expressed in terms of a given set of cost measures. An illustrative example is given."
"Information structures of organizations are studied and applied to problems of dynamic team decisions. For a causal system it is shown that there is a partially ordered precedence relation existing among the decision makers. The team decision problem with linear information structure and quadratic payoff function is dealt with. The primitive random variables are assumed to be jointly Gaussian. The optimal solutions for the teams in which precedents' information is available for the followers are obtained. It is shown that the well-known linear-quadratic-Gaussian stochastic control problem and static team decision problem are special cases of the structure considered."
"The behavior of the solution of the Riccati equation for the linear regulator problem with a parameter whose perturbation changes the order of the system is analyzed. Sufficient conditions are given under which the solution of the original problem tends to the solution of a low-order problem. This result can be used for the decomposition of a high-order problem into two low-order problems."
  "General dynamic team decision problems with linear information structures and quadratic payoff functions are studied. The primitive random variables are jointly Gaussian. No constraints on the information structures are imposed except causality. Equivalence relations in information and in control functions among different systems are developed. These equivalence relations aid in the solving of many general problems by relating their solutions to those of the systems with \"perfect memory.\" The latter can be obtained by the method derived in Part I. A condition is found which enables each decision maker to infer the information available to his precedents, while at the same time the controls which will affect the information assessed can be proven optimal. When this condition fails, upper and lower bounds of the payoff function can still be obtained systematically, and suboptimal controls can be obtained."
"SequentiaUy proven statements are given showing that the whiteness of the innovation sequence of a steady-state Kalman filter is not a sufficient condition for the optimality of the filter. Simulation results are given which verify each of the statements. Definite conclusions are reached concerning the identification of a class of systems by using the output sequence."
"Several authors have studied the stability behavior of slowly varying linear systems of ordinary differential equations. These studies have yielded a sufficient condition for uniform exponential stability. In this work this result is extended to slowly varying linear functional differential equations."
"Necessary conditions for the optimal control of a system represented by a differential-integral equation are derived. It is shown how these conditions may be applied in the study of isoperimetric and sensitivity problems."
"A constant fuel-rate problem is defined. A solution to the constant fuel-rate problem is proposed which consists of a dither adaptive control technique. An illustration of this technique is presented as an analog computer solution to a simple problem."
"The optimal control system derived previously [1], [6] calls for sensing the room temperature TR, the wall surface temperature Tw, and the heat exchanger wall temperature Te. This correspondence summarizes the development of a suboptimum heating system, which 1) can be implemented practically, 2) is acceptable economically, and 3) yields improved performance compared to the conventional system."
"A procedure for the design of linear regulators optimal with respect to a time-multiplied performance index was suggested in a recent paper by Man and Smith. A counterexample, presented subsequently [2], indicated that the procedure was in error. It is shown that the optimal feedback control law must contain time-varying gains as opposed to the time-invariant gains as suggested by Man and Smith. This fact was also overlooked in [2]."
    "A linear system with a quadratic cost function, which is a weighted sum of the integral square regulation error and the integral square input, is considered. What happens to the integral square regulation error as the relative weight of the integral square input reduces to zero is investigated. In other words, what is the maximum accuracy one can achieve when there are no limitations on the input? It turns out that the necessary and sufficient condition for reducing the regulation error to zero is that 1) the number of inputs be at least as large as the number of controlled variables, and 2) the system possess no right-half plane zeros. These results are also \"dualized\" to the optimal filtering problem."
"Instability criteria are obtained for systems described by\\dot{x} = A(t)xwhen the parameters are slowly varying. In particular it is shown that, whenA(t)has eigenvalues in the right-half plane and all eigenvalues are bounded away from the imaginary axis, then if\\sup_{t \\geq 0} \\parallel \\dot{A}(t)\\parallelis sufficiently small, the system has unbounded solutions. Results are also given for systems of the form\\dot{x} = A(t)x + f(x, t), and the dichotomy of solutions is studied in both the linear and nonlinear cases."
"The problem considered in this paper deals with the control of linear discrete-time stochastic systems with unknown (possibly time-varying and random) gain parameters. The philosophy of control is based on the use of an open-loop feedback optimal (OLFO) control using a quadratic index of performance. It is shown that the OLFO system consists of 1) an identifier that estimates the system state variables and gain parameters and 2) a controller described by an \"adaptive\" gain and correction term. Several qualitative properties and asymptotic properties of the OLFO adaptive system are discussed. Simulation results dealing with the control of stable and unstable third-order plants are presented. The key quantitative result is the precise variation of the control system adaptive gains as a function of the future expected uncertainty of the parameters; thus, in this problem the ordinary \"separation theorem\" does not hold."
"The parameter-adaptive self-organizing control of linear discrete-time systems is considered by designing dynamic feedback controllers which depend on the estimates of the parameters provided by an appropriate identifier. Two stochastic approximation algorithms for consistent identification of feedback systems are investigated and a condition of identifiability is presented. Then two controllers, one based on \"overall\" and another based on \"per-interval\" optimization, both depending on the output of the identifier, are discussed and their evaluations relative to the optimal are compared in illustrative examples."
"In recent years, minimum-variance recursive estimators, such as the Kalman filter, have been used successfully in many practical applications. However, a common problem, known in the literature as the divergence phenomenon, is often encountered in these applications. Divergence is said to occur when the error covariance calculated by the estimator becomes inconsistent with the actual error covariance. Previous methods of dealing with this problem have involved limited memory filtering or simultaneous estimation of random process statistics. The method presented here is different in that the state model and statistics are accepted as given; the form of the optimal estimator is used, but a constant check is made on the consistency of the calculated and actual error covariances. The method is independent of the source of error, whether it be inaccuracies in the system model, incorrect values of the a priori and random process statistics, approximations required in the case of nonlinear systems, or computational roundoff. A test for inconsistency and an adaptive decision-directed procedure for adjusting the calculated covariance, shown to be optimal in a certain sense, are discussed. Several simulated examples, in which inconsistencies in the calculated and actual error covariances exist, show a significant improvement in the performance of the estimator when the given procedure is appended."
"Minimum-energy control is obtained for a nonlinear second-order model of a ground transportation vehicle with a dc traction motor for which regenerative braking is possible."
"One advantage of strapdown inertial systems is the feasibility of automatic computation of alignment transformations between two or more attitude reference systems rigidly fixed to some common rigid body. The essential analytical problem involved reduces to the problem of finding some optimal estimate of an orthogonal transformation given a sequence of pairs of observation vectors that are linearly related by the orthogonal transformation. Several solutions to the problem are presented using a least squares cost function. These solutions include optimal but generally nonorthogonal estimates and an optimal estimate constrained to he orthogonal. In addition, a procedure is presented to orthogonalize a generally nonorthogonal estimate in a least squares sense."
"An optimization technique is presented to reduce to zero the angular velocities of a spinning object while minimizing a general performance criterion. Closed-form control laws are obtained for a controller structure with a single nonlinear transducer in the feedback loop that employs the square of the Euclidean distance to the origin as an error signal. Consideration is also given to the \"inverse problem\" of optimal control. Linearization and generalization of the nonlinear plant are discussed."
"Given a single-input controllable discrete-time linear system with accessible state variables, letLbe a set in the state space Rndetermined by the real trace of a continuous real function on Rn. Then a memoryless feedback function can be found such that every point inLgoes to the origin innsteps or less."
"System parameter values can vary from their assumed nominal values. These perturbations may alter the performance of a distributed parameter system from the desired nominal performance to an unacceptable degree. To overcome these undesirable effects it may be possible to utilize feedback control in the system to insure that parameter variations alter the system performance with feedback to a lesser degree than an equivalent open-loop system subject to the same perturbations. New results are developed in the form of sufficient conditions to insure that feedback compensation decreases the effects of parameter variations upon the system dynamics for distributed parameter systems described by linear constant-coefficient partial differential equations which may be nonseparable. The theory is applied to two examples, the most significant of which is that of heat exchange between a moving and a stationary medium such as heating material in a through-passage furnace."
"Finite-dimensional linear systems are considered with the properties of uniform complete controllability and observability. It is shown that exponential asymptotic stability of the homogeneous part of the system is equivalent to the system mapping inputs with finite L2norm into outputs with finite L2norm."
"An improved approximate solution to the nonlinear closed-loop stochastic control problem is presented. The method involves optimizing simultaneously a nominal trajectory, nominal control, and specific form of perturbation controller. It is demonstrated that improved performance is realized over the performance obtained by the widely used method of linearizing the nonlinear system about the deterministic optimal trajectory and employing a Riccati perturbation controller."
"The Bayes' regulator with perfect memory is derived for a linear stochastic plant with an incomplete probabilistic description. Because of the complexity of the equations characterizing the optimal control, two suboptimal approximations are also given. It is shown that under appropriate conditions, one of the suboptimal controllers is better than the best zero memory regulator."
"Stochastic differential games characterized by linear systems and quadratic cost functionals are known to have solutions wherein the optimal strategies are formed as linear transformations of the noisy state observations. These linear transformations are generally unsuitable for use in a situation where the strategies must be computed \"on board,\" since they require retention of the entire observation record. In this paper it is shown that restriction of the players to a class of \"filter-like\" strategies can yield solutions which are optimal within their class and require storage of only a finite-dimensional data array. The time-varying filter gains are expressible as solutions to nonlinear two-point boundary value problems."
"A multilayer control strategy for the control of a class of static nonlinear multivariable systems is described, and the economic tradeoff between the costs of implementing the approach and the performance level achieved is investigated. The definition of the control function at each layer in the control hierarchy is based on a partitioning of the manipulated variables according to a measure of performance sensitivity. The sensitivity of a variable is defined with respect to a measure of the performance degradation produced by variations of the variable from its optimal value. The more sensitive manipulated variables are updated by the lower layers at a higher frequency, while the less sensitive variables are updated by the higher layers at a lower frequency. The design variables of importance to the economic tradeoff are the number of layers in the hierarchy, the variables to be updated by each layer, and the corresponding periods of control action. To ease the computational requirements necessary to carry out the tradeoff analysis, an approximate method of analysis is described in which 1) a simplified approximate tradeoff measure is used to determine the number of layers in the hierarchy, the number of variables to be updated by each layer and the corresponding periods of control action, and 2) the sensitivity functions are used to determine which particular variables are to be updated by each layer. The use of the approximate method of analysis is demonstrated with reference to a simple example."
"Using the convolution integral, an integro-difference equation is derived for defining the input-output relation of a linear time-invariant filter. This equation is, in turn, used to obtain the various analog-to-digital filter transformations for the digitization of a continuous transfer function, with each transformation corresponding to a specific way of approximating the continuous time excitation."
"The steepest descent methods of Bryson and Ho [1] and Kelly [6] and the conjugate gradient method of Lasdon, Mitter, and Waren [3] use control variables as the independent variables in the search procedure. The inequality constraints are often handled via penalty functions which result in poor convergence. Special difficulties are encountered in handling state variable inequality constraints and singular arcs [1]. This paper shows that these difficulties arise due to the exclusive use of control variables as the independent variables in the search procedure. An algorithm based on the generalized reduced gradient (GRG) algorithm of Abadie and Carpentier [5] and Abadie [7] for nonlinear programming is proposed to solve these problems. The choice of the independent variables in this algorithm is dictated by the constraints on the problem and could result in different combinations of state and control variables as independent variables along different parts of the trajectory. The gradient of the cost function with respect to the independent variables, called the generalized gradient, is calculated by solving a set of equations similar to the Euler-Lagrange equations. The directions of search are determined using gradient projection and the conjugate gradient method. Two numerical examples involving state variable inequality constraints are solved [2]. The method is then applied to two examples containing singular arcs and it is shown that these problems can be handled as regular problems by choosing some of the state variables as the independent variables. The relationship of the method to the reduced gradient method of Wolfe [4] and the generalized reduced method of Abadie [7] for nonlinear programming is shown."
"A simple comparison theorem is presented which, in essence, derives a bound on the solution of an integral equation. Several applications to stability theory are dicussed."
"In this paper a new method of solving the linear optimal servo problem is presented. The necessary and sufficient conditions for complete reducibility of a multivariable servo problem to the regulator problem are stated in terms of the desired outputs and proved. It is also shown that the conditions for the existence of the solution to the servo problem with polynomial types of desired outputs are the same as those for complete reducibility. The starting point of the design procedure is the description of the plant in state variable equations. A numerical example is worked out to illustrate the design procedure."
"In previous optimization studies of pulse-frequency-modulated (PFM) control systems it is assumed that a control function exists which carries the system state to the desired final state. In this study a systematic method of determining the regions of initial states (admissible regions) from which the system state can be carried to the origin within a prespecified fixed timeTis developed. The method presented makes use of the topological properties of the \"pulse firing time,\"β-space. Conditions for unique control are presented."
"The conventional methods of determining the relative stability of linear systems are mostly graphical and therefore tedious and time consuming. Analytic solutions for relative stability using the Nyquist criterion become very difficult for higher order systems. A simple relationship is developed establishing a direct link between Routh's stability criterion and the gain margin of a system."
"The use of Balakrishnan's epsilon method is demonstrated. Whereas most optimization schemes are based upon exact satisfaction of the system dynamics and penalty for terminal error, the epsilon method is based upon exact satisfaction of the terminal conditions and penalty for erroneous dynamics. Thus theoretical aspects of the epsilon method are discussed, a method of solution using the Rayleigh-Ritz representation and a modified Newton-Raphson minimization is described, and an optimization problem is solved. Finally, advantages and disadvantages of the epsilon method are discussed."
"A method for accelerating the convergence in model-reference adaptive control systems is presented. The novel feature is to feed back an appropriate function of the parameter misalignment signal to each adjusting mechanism channel. The adaptive loops incorporating feedback can be synthesized either directly from a Lyapunov function or indirectly from the minimization of a Lyapunov function along the steepest descent path. In both cases the derivative of the Lyapunov function is negative definite in error and parameter misalignment, whereas it is only semidefinite in previous work. The advantages are easy implementation and rapid convergence to zero of both the system-response error and the errors of the adjustable parameters. Simulation studies on a second-order system confirm the theoretical predictions."
"A conceptually simple algorithm is presented for determining the orders of the minor blocks in the Jordan canonical form of a given matrix whose eigenvalues are known."
"Optimal control policies for a class of systems described by differential-difference equations are obtained. The method of solution is a transformation of the original problem into an equivalent ordinary optimal control problem. Standard techniques then apply from which the control is obtained in either open-loop or closed-loop form."
"The stability of any multivariable linear time-invariant control system can always be determined by existing methods. However, the designer needs to know how stability is affected by changes in loop gains and other parameters. This leads to a requirement for decomposing the stability problem, if possible, into a number of subproblems. New results of this type are given here."
"Sufficient conditions for the stability of a class of multiplicative time-varying as well as time-invariant nonlinear systems are presented."
"The steady-state offset in type-O systems with delay (and constant excitation) for the critically stable case contains an additional component when the delay is not constant. This phenomenon is illustrated by an example."
"It is shown that the coefficients in the characteristic equation of a constant linear system can be altered by finite amounts without making the system unstable. The perturbations depend on a single parameter and are straightforward to calculate. Bounds are given for the real parts of the roots of the perturbed polynomial."
"Necessary and sufficient conditions for a partitioned matrix to be nonnegative definite and positive definite are derived in terms of its four submatrices."
"The logarithm of the square of the Euclidean norm is proposed as a Lyapunov function for synthesis of control systems which are finite-time stable. In some cases this appears to be a more useful Lyapunov function than the square of the Euclidean norm, since the inequalities resulting from use of a logarithmic Lyapunov function are typical of those which occur in classical stability theory. Thus, intuition developed in design of asymptotically stable systems is directly applicable to the design of finite-time stable systems. Also, in some cases the logarithmic Lyapunov function will provide a wider range of parameter values for which it is known that one has finite-time stability."
"A frequency domain stability criterion for nonlinear time-varying (NLTV) discrete systems with a separable time-varying nonlinearity is derived using the Lyapunov approach. It is shown that Szegö's [1] criterion for nonlinear time-invariant discrete systems and Chen's [4] criterion for linear time-varying discrete systems can be obtained as special cases of the criterion derived here."
"A procedure is presented for reducing the on-line computing time and storage requirements when estimating the state of a class of linear-discrete systems."
"A previously presented technique for solving the extended Lyapunov matrix equation is applied to the extended discrete Lyapunov matrix equation. The system matrix is first transformed to its Jordan canonical form. Then an explicit solution is obtained for the equivalent equation which results."
"The ideal sampler approximation is examined for band-limited systems and signals. An explicit formula is derived which shows that the sum of the system bandwidth and the signal bandwidth must be small compared to the inverse of the pulse duration if the approximation is to be valid."
"The synthesis of an optimally sensitive control system is extended to the noisy case, and it is shown that estimates of the present state and unknown plant parameter vectors are sufficient. The resulting system is optimally sensitive to errors in both the initial state and the unknown plant parameters."

 "Presents the back cover of the periodical issue."
"A technique for constructing the transfer function of the left inverse to a linear multivariable finite-dimensional time-invariant system is presented. The technique is applicable to continuous- or discrete-time systems. Several illustrative examples are discussed."
"Necessary and sufficient conditions for the controllability of tandem-connected systems are given. Unlike previous methods, the subsystems need not be first transformed to the Jordan canonical form. Instead, a relatively simple transformation based on the input matrix B has to be applied before using the above conditions. Also, for the special case of subsystems with disjoint sets of eigenvalues, a necessary and sufficient condition is given in terms of the general state representation of the subsystems and is usually easier to apply than the one developed for the general case."
   "A cycloid type of critical curve for slope-limited non-linearities has been presented in Riemenschneider and Mastascusa. An alternative derivation of these critical curves, already available in the literature, is pointed out and it is shown that these alternative parametric equations are more suitable for a graphical construction."
 "A minimum-energy controller is designed and built for a class of electrically driven vehicles according to the theoretical concepts determined by the application of modern control theory. Theoretical results are obtained by making several justifiable assumptions in the dynamical equations of the system and solving the resulting stochastic optimal control problem by Bellman's dynamic programming technique. Several practical and economical considerations are taken into account for the mechanization of the minimum-energy control law."

   "The authors of the previous discussion claim a counterexample to the theorem in Larson's work. This counterexample is not valid because of their incorrect interpretation of the extension to the multistage case. They do, however, present the correct interpretation of this extension. These points are discussed in some detail in this reply, as well as some additional results on conditions under which the theorem is valid and some comments on the practical value of the theorem."

"The zeros off(z) = (az - b)^{n} \\pm (cz - d)^{n}are found to lie on a circle of radius|(ad - cb)/(|a|^{2} - |c|^{2})|with its center atz = (a^{\\ast}b - c^{\\ast}d)/(|a|^{2} - |c|^{2}), wherea, b, c, anddare complex numbers andnis assumed real.

"A design method is developed for a class of controllers which bound a nonlinear control systems response within prescribed specifications for a set of initial conditions. The design method is based upon the quantitative properties of a class of Lyapunov functions and a time domain ratio criterion. A digital computer algorithm which permits the automation of a large portion of the design method is presented."
"A linear continuous-time system is given whose input and output disturbances and initial conditions are unknown but bounded by known convex sets. These sets, together with the system dynamics and any available observation, determine at any time a set of all possible states, containing the true state of the system. An ellipsoidal bound on this set is obtained. The positive-definite matrix and the center which describe the bounding ellipsoid are found to obey two coupled differential equations: a Riccati matrix differential equation and a vector differential equation. They are similar in structure to the Kalman filter equations except that the matrix part of the solution is not precomputable. A precomputable bound can be obtained, however. The cases with no output and no input disturbances are discussed. An \"almost-precomputable\" bound is described. Computational results show the applicability and the limitation of the approach."

"The concept of the so-called generalized polynomial operators is considered and applied especially to systems described by certain types of nonlinear differential equations. A theorem concerning local invertibility of polynomial operators is given. By an example it is shown how this theorem can be used to prove the existence of solutions, to construct those solutions, and to find a region of BIBO stability of the aforementioned systems. The treatment is quite general, being based on functional analysis. In particular, it can be applied to the systems analyzed by using functional series of Volterra type."
 "In Section IV of the above paper a method is developed for obtaining one explicit minimal-order optimal observer-estimator for the case in which some measurements are noisy while others are noise free. In this correspondence a more analytic and simpler method than the above one is presented. It is also shown that the simplest deadbeat observer given in Section V of the above paper can be refined."
"Power series solutions to the matrix covariance differential equation\\dot{P} = AP + (AP)' + Qand the transition differential equation\\dot{\\Phi} = A\\Phiare reexamined. Truncation error bounds are derived which are computationally attractive and which extend previous results. Polynomial approximations are obtained by exploiting the functional equations satisfied by the transition and covariance matrices. The series-functional equation propagation technique represents a fast and accurate alternative to the numerical integration of the time-invariant transition and covariance equations."

Several quadratic criteria are proposed to aid in determining suitable candidate systems. One criterion for choosingBis initial condition dependent, and another bounds the \"worst case\" homogeneous system performance. Both of these criteria produce weighted least squares fits toA(t)."

"It is generally preferable to estimate unknown parameters in analog transfer functions by sampled data techniques. This approach calls for the derivation of an appropriate discrete modelD(z)for a given analog systemH(s)with undetermined parameters, and then the fitting of the sampled input-output data byD(z)to estimate these parameters. This correspondence presents a method for obtaining such discrete models. It also provides a more effective procedure for calculating the parameter estimates from the identified discrete transfer function\\hat{D}(z)."

"A computational method is introduced for solving quantized control problems. It is a method developed by Jacobson [6] based on dynamic programming and is useful for computing optimal control inputs for nonlinear systems. It is a successive approximation technique such that at each iteration, the system equations are integrated forward in time using the current nominal control, and accessory equations, which yield the changes in the switch times of the optimal control, are integrated in reverse to obtain an improved control. This improved control is then used as the new nominal control for the next iteration. By continued iteration, the procedure produces control functions which successively improve the approximation to the optimal control function."

"The stability of composite systems is investigated in terms of their subsystems and their interconnecting structure. Whereas previous investigators utilized vector Lyapunov functions in their approach, scalar functions consisting of weighted sums of scalar Lyapunov functions of subsystems of the composite systems are employed presently. It is shown that the scalar Lyapunov function approach may in general yield stability results which are less conservative than those obtained by the vector Lyapunov function approach. Both methods are applied to specific examples considered previously. These examples demonstrate the improvement of the present results."
 "Estimation of the state of a nonlinear discrete-time system using quantized data is considered. An exact solution for the maximum likelihood estimate is expressed as the solution of a nonlinear two-point boundary-value problem. Approximate recursive solutions for both the maximum likelihood and the conditional-mean estimates are obtained. The results of Monte-Carlo simulations are presented in which the performance of these two algorithms is compared with that of a Kalman filter in which the quantization error is approximated by white noise."
"It is noted that some recent stability results for singular perturbation problems are special cases of earlier theorems by Klimushev and Krasovskii. A simplified proof of one of these theorems is given."
"The problem of divergence that often arises when the filter mechanization is based on lower order process dynamics is examined. This situation may be caused, for example, by the impossibility of completely identifying some of the process parameters. It is suggested that instead of totally neglecting the affected state variables a minimal sensitivity estimate of these be obtained on the basis of the nominal values of the imperfectly known parameters. The result of applying this scheme to a system, part of whose state vector is thus affected, is also examined."
"In [1] a procedure was presented for obtaining the minimal realization of discrete, linear systems from input-output observations. The extension to the continuous case is presented here. Of particular importance is the fact that the extension presented avoids differentiation of the observed signals."
"A simple algorithm is proposed for constructing a realization of a dynamical system described by means of its transfer function matrix with multiple poles. The dimension of the realization is smaller than or at the most equal to the lesser of the one obtained from techniques proposed by Glass [2] and Lal et al. [3]."
"An extension is given to Kalman observer theory which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for reduced-order Kalman observers for the case when it is required to observe a specified linear functional of the states of a system rather than the states themselves. The results are useful for the design of low-order compensators for systems with noisy output measurements."
"The state regulator problem with quadratic performance measure is investigated with emphasis being placed on the development of a controller that remains finite over a fixed time interval for the fixed endpoint problem where all of the system states are not available for feedback.

"The object of this paper is to obtain a bounded-input, bounded-output type of stability criterion for systems with non-linearities that do not satisfy the sector condition. A criterion is obtained that is based on the nature of the operation of the elements of the system on the derivatives of the input and output functions. This criterion has the following form when applied to a feedback system made up of a time-invariant linear element in cascade with a nonlinear element. If the slope of the input-output characteristic of the nonlinear element is bounded, and if the linear element satisfies a circle or Popov condition for these bounds, then the system maps input functions whose derivatives belong to the space\\{x(t)/ \\ni \\sigma > 0 \\ni e^{\\sigma t} x(t) \\in L_{2}[0, \\infty)\\}into output functions of the same class. This class of functions is a subspace of the spaceL_{\\infty} [0, \\infty), and as a consequence, a bounded-input, bounded-output type of stability criterion is established. Experiments were performed with feedback systems containing hysteresis-type nonlinear elements, and the feedback limit gain for stability so determined was compared with that predicted by the stability criterion. For different experimental systems and for different assumptions, the theoretically predicted limit gain ranged from about 1/3 to about 9/10 the limit gain observed experimentally."
 "The aim of this note is to report an algorithm for the fixed lag smoothing problem of a time delayed system whose observations contain colored noise. This is derived by looking at the appropriate components of a filtering algorithm for a nontime delayed higher dimensional system."

"In a recent paper by Woodside et al. [1] the introduction of a penalty function to handle state constraints was found to lead to a singular arc in a problem of optimizing an electric steel refining process. Some numerical results were also given indicating a slow convergence of the penalty function solution to the solution of a constrained problem. In this correspondence a slightly different penalty function is used for the same problem. It is shown that the penalty function solution not only roughly approximates the solution to the state constrained problem, but that the singular arc and state constrained arcs coincide in the limit."

"It is shown that the partial realization problem treated by Kalman [1] and Tether [2] can be solved in a simple way using the method of [3] instead of Ho's algorithm."
 "When solving optimal control problems with bounded state variables, one must determine whether the optimal trajectory intersects the boundary only at isolated points in time (boundary point) or remains on the boundary for a nonzero length of time (boundary arc). Previously, this determination has been made by trial and error. The task is complicated by the fact that the necessary conditions in common use for these problems assume that the solution has a boundary arc, and can thus yield a boundary arc when the solution has no boundary arc. In this paper the necessary conditions of [1] are used to derive conditions under which the optimal trajectory cannot have a boundary arc. These conditions include the condition for no boundary arcs developed in [1] as a special case. The application of these conditions is illustrated via several examples."
"The well-known matrix algebraic equation of the optimal control and filtering theory is considered. A necessary and sufficient condition for its solution to yield an optimal as well as asymptotically stable closed-loop system is given. The condition involves the concepts of stabilizability and detectability."

"It is shown that every linear system with nondynamic feedback is optimal with respect to a quadratic performance index that includes a cross-product term between the state and control. If the index is further generalized to include derivatives of the control, every (sufficiently smooth) linear finite-dimensional dynamic feedback and feedforward control system is optimal. Methods of constructing all such indices are indicated, and some practical implications are discussed."
"This paper considers the problem of transformation of functions in L2by linear time-invariant causal systems and the conditions under which this transformation preserves the completeness of sets in L2.

"The system under consideration is that of a motor, coupled by a gear train to an inertial load, where the requirement is to rotate the load by a given angle and come to a halt. The question considered is whether the use of a variable gear, instead of one with constant ratio, will reduce the required energy, and if so, what are the optimal gear ratio function and the corresponding control function."
"An indirect numerical method is presented that solves a class of optimal control problems that have a singular arc occurring after an initial nonsingular arc. This method iterates on the subset of initial costate variables that enforce the junction conditions for switching to a singular arc, and the time of switching off of the singular arc to a final nonsingular arc, to reduce a terminal error function of the final conditions to zero. This results in the solution to the two-point boundary-value problem obtained using the minimum principle and some necessary conditions for singular arcs. The main advantage of this method is that the exact solution to the two-point boundary-value problem is obtained. The main disadvantage is that the sequence of controls for the problem must be known to apply this method. Two illustrative examples are presented."
"Relations between reduced-order Markov and Hermite criteria are discussed."
"This note presents a method for approximating a high-order linear-system transfer function by a low-order model. The method developed is based on the requirement that the magnitude ratio of the frequency responses of the model and the original system deviate the least at various frequencies. In selecting the order and structure of the model, one has the flexibility of prefixing certain poles and zeros in the model transfer function."

"A practical method for designing a linear regulator with incomplete state feedback controller is presented. This approach treats the optimal system of complete state feedback as an ideal model for the design of the incomplete state feedback controller, which is a linear combination of only the available state variables. The design is based on the approximation of the closed-loop system transfer function to the ideal model transfer function."
"In a previous note the author obtained necessary conditions for the optimal control of a system represented by a non-linear differential-integral equation with a general cost function. This note considers the special case of a linear system with a quadratic cost and proposes an iterative method for the solution of the necessary conditions. The method proposed is based on a similar approach suggested by Mueller in his report on systems with constant time lag."
"An on-line method is developed for the determination of the parameters of a linear continuous finite-dimensional system in the presence of initial conditions. This is achieved through the use of successive integration of not only the system excitation and response signals but also an impulse of unit strength. The conditions under which the proposed method gives a unique solution is presented in the form of a theorem."
"It is often convenient to use a combination of a sample-and-hold element and a feedback analog filter to simulate a digital transfer functionD(z). This note delineates the requirements thatD(z)must satisfy so that the analog filter can be implemented on a general purpose analog computer."
"A metal-rolling example is used to illustrate the natural occurrence of functional equations in physical processes and the approximations needed to reduce these to the more common point-function forms in which the variable delay appears as a state variable and, finally, with constant delay. An example illustrates the close correspondence between the transient responses of the more accurate model and its approximations."
"A nonquadratic performance measure is considered as a criterion for the design of optimal controllers for nonlinear single-input systems. The design procedure presented is somewhat novel in that no two-point boundary value problems need be solved and that closed-form solutions for the optimal control are obtained."
"A sufficient condition for a linear time-invariant system to be stabilizable by output feedback control is obtained by using a geometric approach."
"The equivalent gain of a zero-memory nonlinear system to random inputs is generalized to an equivalent impulse response of a general nonlinear system."
 "Two new numerical methods which may be used to calculate solutions to optimal control problems are developed. These methods involve guessing initial values for unknown Lagrange multipliers and a control sequence. They are similar to the successive sweep method in that Riccati equations are used to calculate corrections to these guessed variables. They integrate Riccati equations, however, which differ from the one integrated by the standard sweep method. The effectiveness of these methods along with a standard method based on the integration of linear equations are compared for two example problems, the Brachistochrone and an Earth-to-Mars low thrust transfer problem."
"The topic of this paper is the simultaneous estimation of state and parameters in linear discrete-time dynamic systems. The system is subject to a known arbitrary input (control), a random input (additive driving noise), and the output observation is also contaminated by noise. The noises are Gaussian, zero mean, independent, and with known variances. The problem is formulated under the assumption that the system parameters are unknown constants. Previous works in the literature treated this problem either approximately or by assuming that each parameter can take values over a finite set with known a priori probabilities. An exact solution has been presented only for a scalar parameter. The proposed scheme yields the maximum likelihood estimates for the system's state and unknown parameters. They are obtained by solving the likelihood equations, a system of nonlinear equations with the state and parameters as unknowns. Use is made of the fact that the dynamical system considered is linear and the problem is separated into two interconnected linear problems: one for the state, the other for the parameters. The solution is obtained by iterating between two systems of linear equations. The estimation technique presented is optimal in the following sense. No approximations are involved and the estimates of the parameters converge to the true values at the fastest possible rate, as given by the Cramér-Rao lower bound, i.e., they are asymptotically efficient. This is proved, using a theorem which states that, under certain conditions, the maximum likelihood estimate with dependent observations is consistent and asymptotically efficient. The problem of uniqueness of the solution is discussed for the case of a scalar unknown parameter. Use is made of a theorem due to Perlman, generalized for the case of dependent observations. Due to the fact that the estimation-identification is done in the presence of input and output noise and an arbitrary known input, the procedure can be considered an on-line technique. Since estimates are available after each measurement, this estimation-identification procedure is suited for use in the adaptive control of unknown (or partially known) linear plants."
"This paper considers the problem of designing an observer to estimate a linear function of the state of a linear system, for the purpose of implementing a feedback control law. In the single-output case a necessary and sufficient condition is found for the existence of an observer of given order and pole configuration. A procedure is stated for constructing the observer, and an algorithm for determining minimal order is outlined. The multi-output case is reduced via a canonical form to an output-coupled set of single-output systems which can be treated as above. Observers derived using these procedures are generally of lower order than those of Luenberger, and the restriction that plant and observer have no common poles is unnecessary."

"Short-term economic stabilization policy is approached as a problem in optimal control. The optimal control problem is defined as a dual discrete-time tracking problem (nominal state and nominal policy trajectories are tracked) for a linear time-invariant system with a quadratic cost functional. This problem is solved analytically, and the solution is applied to a 28-state variable quarterly econometric model. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach is valuable both as a tool for policy planning and as a method of analyzing the dynamic properties of econometric models."
    "An analysis based on the concepts of equivalent non-linearity and describing function is used to derive an expression for the minimum amplitude of dither required to quench limit cycle oscillations in feedback systems containing a hysteresis-type nonlinearity in the forward path. The treatment is related to recent work by Manohar and Sellappan."
 "Using the notation and methods of functional analysis, a stability criterion is derived for a class of nonlinear discrete systems. The class of systems investigated consists of a nonlinear static operator satisfying a sector condition, followed by a bounded linear causal operator that satisfies an inner product inequality. A simple graphical means of obtaining stability information similar to the Popov criterion is obtained when the bounded causal linear operator is constrained to be a discrete convolution operator."
"In this note, we consider the input-output stability of feedback systems whose forward element is linear and time varying and whose feedback element is a memoryless gain multiplier with a gain that is absolutely integrable as a function of time. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the input-output stability of such systems."
            "Because many systems of practical interest fall outside the scope of linear theory, it is desirable to enlarge as much as possible the class of systems for which a complete structure theory is available. In this paper a class of finite-state sequential systems evolving in groups is considered. The concepts of controllability, observability, minimality, realizability, and the isomorphism of minimal realizations are developed. Results that are analogous to, but differ in essential details from, those of linear system theory are derived. These results are potentially useful in such diverse areas as algorithmic design and algebraic decoding."
"A new approach to the exact model matching problem is given based on an algorithm for characterizing the input-output structural properties of a linear system. In contrast to previous methods, the state feedback matching problem is solved without recourse to initial coordinate transformations. Moreover, the algorithm given here extends directly to the dynamic model matching problem and yields a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for one system to be transfer function equivalent via dynamic state feedback to a specified model system."
"The optimum filtering problem for a general class of linear distributed-parameter systems with colored observation noise is studied. The input stochastic disturbance is assumed to be white in time, but it may have correlation in space of any type. The optimum filter is derived through a learning theorem which gives the mean value and covariance matrix of a conditional distributed-parameter random variableX_{1}(D)givenX_{2}(D)whereX_{1}(D) = {X_{1}(x); x \\in D}andX_{2}(D) = {X_{2}(x); x \\in D}are Gaussian variables with known mean values and covariance matrices. The fixed-interval smoothing problem for the same class of systems is then considered and solved with the aid of a distributed-parameter theorem concerning the combination of two independent estimates of the state based on different data records. A numerical filtering example is included to illustrate the theory. The results of the paper may find applications in all fields where the information to be processed is distributed in space and depends either on continuous or on discrete time."
"Knowledge of the probability density function of the state conditioned on all available measurement data provides the most complete possible description of the state, and from this density any of the common types of estimates (e.g., minimum variance or maximum a posteriori) can be determined. Except in the linear Gaussian case, it is extremely difficult to determine this density function. In this paper an approximation that permits the explicit calculation of the a posteriori density from the Bayesian recursion relations is discussed and applied to the solution of the nonlinear filtering problem. In particular, it is noted that a weighted sum of Gaussian probability density functions can be used to approximate arbitrarily closely another density function. This representation provides the basis for procedure that is developed and discussed."
"This paper deals with the application of the gradient iteration to a class of ill-posed estimation problems arising in many different contexts, such as system and channel identification, radar mapping and resolution, enhancement or restoration of optical images, and so on. The basic problem is one of infinite-dimensional linear regression type where the unknown\\chiis a function constrained in an arbitrary functional Hilbert spaceb, and the observation noise is a second-order stochastic process. It is shown that a necessary and sufficient condition for the gradient iteration to define a sequence of estimates\\{\\hat{x}_{p}\\}in the constraint spacebis one of strong stochastic nonsingularity for a hypothetical detection problem. Conditions that guarantee the convergence of the gradient iterates\\{\\hat{x}_{p}\\}in a suitable sense are also given."
"This paper presents a dual-mode decentralized scheme for controlling the flow of a commodity through a network. In the first mode, the local controllers, which are located at the nodes of the network, exchange some simple messages with their neighbors and determine the local optimum flows. In the second mode, the local controllers adjust their flows to achieve the optimum steady-state conditions in finite time."
"Guaranteed cost control is a method of synthesizing a closed-loop system in which the controlled plant has large parameter uncertainty. This paper gives the basic theoretical development of guaranteed cost control, and shows how it can be incorporated into an adaptive system. The uncertainty in system parameters is reduced first by either: 1) on-line measurement and evaluation, or 2) prior knowledge on the parametric dependence of a certain easily measured situation parameter. Guaranteed cost control is then used to take up the residual uncertainty. It is shown that the uncertainty in system parameters can be taken care of by an additional term in the Riccati equation. A Fortran program for computing the guaranteed cost matrix and control law is developed and applied to an airframe control problem with large parameter variations."

"An optimal stochastic control problem is considered with a probability criterion. A stochastic differential equation model is assumed. The optimization problem is to maximize the probability that the state trajectory remain in a given bounded regionDover a given finite time interval. This type of criterion is especially relevant to certain technical problems where it is essential that certain state variables not exceed given values, and is closely related to the concepts of finite time stability. For the class of dynamical systems considered, the optimal control is bang-bang. A numerical method developed by Samarskii is used to solve the optimization equation, a nonlinear partial differential equation of the parabolic type. A second-order system is computed to illustrate numerical results. Time-varying switching curves for the optimal bang-bang solution are plotted."
"This paper is a survey of the salient results developed in the literature of econometrics over the past twenty years regarding simultaneous equations systems. Models of economic behavior are generally characterized by simultaneous equations; this characterization is due to the general equilibrium theory of economic phenomena according to which a large number of economic variables are mutually determined so that often causality is held to be bidirectional. A natural formulation of this, for empirical work, is to represent the economic phenomena under consideration by simultaneous (generally linear) equations systems. This presents considerable problems in estimating the parameters of the resulting models since the least squares procedure can be shown to yield inconsistent estimators. To remedy this deficiency a number of estimating procedures have been devised. Such procedures can be classed in two broad categories. Full information procedures take into account, in estimating the parameters, all sample information and a priori restrictions on the coefficients of the entire system. Limited information procedures estimate consistently, but typically inefficiently, the unknown parameters of each equation by taking into account only the immediately relevant part of the sample information and the a priori restrictions that apply specifically to the equation under consideration. The paper examines the several variants proposed in each category and considers models which are dynamic and in which the error vectors are classical, i.e., they constitute a sequence of mutually independent identically distributed random variables, as well as cases where the error vectors are finite order autoregressions. The asymptotic distribution and other relevant properties of all such estimators are either explicitly derived or noted and there is a brief discussion of some small sample results and instances of applications of such techniques to the estimation of economy wide econometric models of various countries such as the U.S., U.K., and Japan."
"A Gaussian elimination algorithm is proposed to compute the determinants of inners of certain types of matrices.

"A sufficient condition for asymptotic stability in the large is proposed for nonlinear systems. It is applicable if the system in question can be decomposed into subsystems, if appropriate Lyapunov functions are obtained for the subsystems, and if the connections between subsystems have bounded dc gains. It is generally less restrictive than the condition previously presented by Bailey for similar systems. An estimate of transient behavior, together with the stability condition, is also given."

"The inverse problem of the optimal regulator is considered for a general class of multi-input systems with integral-type performance indices. A new phase variable canonical form is shown to be convenient for this analysis. The advantage of the canonical form is to separate the state variables into subvectors of directly controlled, indirectly controlled, and uncontrollable components. Necessary and sufficient conditions for optimized performance indices are given. With the nonlinearities of the system restricted to functions of the directly controlled state variables, additional results are developed about the nonnegative property of optimized, loss functions. Answers are given to the following two questions. What performance indices can be optimized by an identically zero feedback control law? What performance indices can be optimized in a linearly synthesized feedback control system?"
"A definition of a general type of sampling mechanism at the input and the output of a continuous-time system is given. The coefficients of the resulting discrete-time system are computed and conditions for controllability and stabilizability are derived. Also, the problem is considered whether the system can be made controllable by a suitable linear connection of the sampling mechanism and the continuous-time system. Finally, it is shown that if the continuous-time system is controllable and an arbitrary sampling time is given, then a sampling mechanism can be constructed such that the sampled system is controllable. Similar results are obtained with stabilizability instead of controllability."
"A method is presented for finding time-optimal (or suboptimal) excitation control for power system stability. The control is found directly as a function of the states of the system, which can be measured. A closed-loop control is found for the linearized system first, then the method is extended to the nonlinear model. The results obtained for the single-machine infinite bus problem are compared with those obtained by a steepest descent method. For small disturbances where linearity holds, the closed-loop scheme gives optimal solutions, while, for large disturbances, it yields a sub-optimal solution."
"Attitude-control system propellant consumption is a major concern for one mode of long-term operation of the Skylab. In this mode the dynamic behavior of the inertial roll angle is described by a second-order nonlinear time-varying differential equation. The main result established in this paper is the following. If the reaction control system is of the form considered, then the roll angle exhibits a bounded behavior. The bounding cycle is described explicitly in terms of the system and control parameters."

It is shown that the spacecraft exhibits a trap state which corresponds to a transverse angular rate of ωn, where ωndenotes the natural frequency of the specific damping system used. In particular, it is indicated that for\\omega_{10} < \\omega_{n}, where ω10is the initial transverse angular rate of the spacecraft, a trap state occurs when the initial displacement z0of the damper mass with respect to the spacecraft principal axis exceeds a certain critical value; while for\\omega_{10} > \\omega_{n}, the trap state occurs for any nonzero value of z0."
"This correspondence gives a simple example of an unstable linear distributed system with a finite number of unstable modes that can be completely stabilized by finite-dimensional linear feedback controls using only the information on the unstable modes.

However, with the constraint sets most frequently considered in the literature, the reachable sets must be zonoids, a severe restriction on possible shapes whend > 2. On the other hand, given a zonoid, there is a differential system with scalar bang-bang control that has this zonoid as a reachable set."

Whenp = 2, the primary ingredient of the criterion is a frequency-domain condition on the linear part of the system. This frequency-domain condition is the critical disk criterion when the system has only one input and one output."
"New criteria in the multiplier form are presented for the input-output stability in the L2-space of a linear system with a time-varying elementk(t)in a feedback loop. These are sufficient conditions for the system stability and involve conditions on the shifted imaginary-axis behavior of the multipliers. The criteria permit the use of noncausal multipliers, and it is shown that this necessitatesdk/dtto be bounded from above as well as from below. The method of derivation draws on the theory of positivity of compositions of operators and time-varying gains, and the results are shown to be more general than the existing criteria."
"Analytical design techniques are developed for multivariable feedback control systems. The design includes a saturation constraint and provides for a disturbance at the system output and additive noise at the system input. The system inputs (signal, noise, and disturbance) are assumed to be generated by independent, stationary, stochastic processes that are adequately represented by rational power-spectral-density matrices. System elements are represented by rational transfer function matrices using the bilateral Laplace transform. The design is applicable to linear time-invariant systems. Design formulas are derived for the general case where the transfer function matrix representing the fixed elements of the system may not be square. The basic design consists of minimizing a weighted sum of the output mean-square errors and the mean-square values of a selected set of saturation signals. A variational technique is used in the optimization, and the technique of spectral factorization is used to obtain a solution. An example is presented to illustrate the design procedure."
"Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for a minimal order linear time-invariant differential feedback control system to exist for a linear time-invariant multivariable system with unmeasurable arbitrary disturbances of a given class occurring in it, such that the outputs of the system asymptotically become equal to preassigned functions of a given class of outputs, independent of the disturbances occurring in the system, and such that the closed-loop system is controllable. The feedback gains of the control system are obtained so that the dynamic behavior of the closed-loop system is specified by using either an integral quadratic optimal control approach or a pole assignment approach. The result may be interpreted as being a generalization of the single-input, single-output servomechanism problem to multivariable systems or as being a solution to the asymptotic decoupling problem."
"In this paper we consider some aspects of the problem of feedback control of a time-invariant uncertain system subject to state constraints over an infinite-time interval. The central question that we investigate is under what conditions can the state of the uncertain system be forced to stay in a specified region of the state space for all times by using feedback control. At the same time we study the behavior of the region ofn-step reachability asntends to infinity. It is shown that in general this region may exhibit instability as we pass to the limit, and that under a compactness assumption this region converges to a steady state. A special case involving a linear finite-dimensional system is examined in more detail. It is shown that there exist ellipsoidal regions in state space where the state can be confined by making use of a linear time-invariant control law, provided that the system is stabilizable. Such control laws can be calculated efficiently through the solution of a recursive matrix equation of the Riccati type."
"The convexization procedure developed for a class of minimax problems is applied to the determination of the minimax solution of the multiple-target problem. The method is parallel to that used in earlier works, but the results are completely independent. It is shown that the state space may be partitioned into subregions in which the minimax strategy is a pure strategy and into subregions in which it is a mixed strategy in the terminology developed in the theory of games, which aptly characterizes the nature of the minimax solution in this problem. It is also shown that the minimax strategy in open-loop form is a piecewise linear function of the initial state and a linear function of the state along the resulting trajectory. In feedback form, it is a piecewise linear function of the state and the cost incurred in the elapsed interval of play."
"Although the class of methods of feasible directions, which can be used for solving constrained optimization problems in Rn, is quite large, only a few of these methods can be extended for the solution of optimal control problems. This paper reviews three of the most promising algorithms in this class: an extension of the Frank-Wolfe method due to Barnes, a dual method due to Pironneau and Polak, and a method due to Zoutendijk."
"The Lie series recursive algorithm for Zubov's partial differential equation is used to generate two sets of points, where one represents the exact asymptotic stability boundary of an equilibrium state of the nonlinear system under consideration and the other is interior to it. Based on these two sets of data as training samples of two classes, a decision hypersurface can be determined such that it is a close approximation of the asymptotic stability boundary."
"The mathematical description of entrainment of van der Pol oscillations, though not simple, is at present reasonably well understood. In contrast to this, the physical mechanisms responsible for the phenomenon have remained completely elusive. This paper will show that there are in fact three physically different processes which can cause synchronism, or entrainment. They will be designated as phaselocking (PL), passive asynchronous quenching (PAQ), and active asynchronous quenching (AAQ). The purpose is to demonstrate the above physical interpretation and to derive criteria to distinguish among the three processes. In doing so, we hopefully resolve the present controversy over entrainment in this TRANSACTIONS. The mathematical criteria will be given in the form of a set of regions mapped on the resonance diagram. This is done because this representation is the one most familiar to readers acquainted with the subject. The key to the physics of entrainment, however, is theb_{1} - b_{2}parameter plane description of transient behavior originally due to Andronov and Witt (A-W plane). For this reason, the connection between the A-W plane and the resonance diagram is discussed first. Next, the physics of PL is explained by using the limiting case of \"pure PL\" seen in relaxation oscillations. After this, a hydro-mechanical model of the A-W plane description is developed by means of the generalization of Adler's \"pendulum model.\" This is then utilized to show that the presence of a \"saddle point\" is the condition necessary for PL to occur. The model will also be used to obtain the criteria for AAQ and PAQ. These results are relevant to the fields of control, communication, and biology."

The results are applied to linear system identification problems."
"The aim of this paper is the provision of a framework for a practical stochastic unconstrained optimization theory. The results are based on certain concepts of stochastic approximation, although not restricted to those procedures, and aim at incorporating the great flexibility of currently available deterministic optimization ideas into the stochastic problem, whenever optimization must be done by Monte Carlo or sampling methods. Hills with nonunique stationary points are treated. A framework has been provided, with which convergence of stochastic versions of conjugate gradient, partan, etc., can be discussed and proved."

"The problem of the existence of redundancy in the data in a recursive estimation problem is investigated. Given a certain data rate, should the estimator be run at the same rate? It is shown that under certain conditions there is redundancy in the data and the estimator can be run at a lower rate using compressed data with practically the same performance as when no data compression is utilized. It is also pointed out that, although at the higher rate there is redundancy in the data, the performance deteriorates noticeably when the data rate is lowered. Conditions for the existence of redundancy in the data and the procedure to remove it are presented. The procedure to compress the data is obtained such as to preserve the information in the sense of Fisher. The effect of data compression is a reduction in the computation requirements by a factor equal to the compression ratio. Such a reduction might be important in real-time applications in which the computing power is limited or too expensive. The application of this technique to the tracking of a reentry vehicle with a linearized filter is discussed in more detail and simulation results are presented."
"The minimum variance estimates of state variables in a noisy, nonlinear discrete-time system are evaluated by a Monte Carlo method. The a posteriori probability density function for state variables conditioned upon measurement data sequence is expanded into a series of orthonormal Hermite functions and numerically determined in a recursive form.

"Loeb's criterion and the incremental-input describing function (IDF) stability technique are compared for general nonlinear second- and third-order systems. Situations in which the two stability techniques disagree are determined and studied in detail. The IDF stability technique is related directly to the variational approach for a general system, and Loeb's criterion is related to that for second-order systems. The IDF stability technique is shown to involve the approximation of time averaging in addition to the inherent describing function (DF) approximation. Discrepancies between the two are found to coincide with relatively poor DF approximations. One technique cannot be considered better than the other in applications-they should be used together for proper interpretation."

The possible use of this method to discover the proper structure of an optimal control that may then be implemented in a much simpler fashion for real-time applications is discussed."

 "Numerical results are given comparing Kalaba's new approach with a classical method for evaluating a simple optimal control problem. Kalaba's new approach is to convert the optimal control problem directly into an initial-value problem without utilizing the Euler equations, Pontryagin's maximum principle, or the principle of optimality. The classical method utilizes the calculus of variations to obtain the Euler equations with the two-point boundary conditions.

The optimal control is given by a linear sampled-states feedback law where the feedback operator is shown to be the bounded seff-adjoint positive semidefinite solution of a Riccati operator difference equation."
 "Some extensions on recent work in passive stability theory by Desoer and the author are presented. The stability of feedback systems is considered where the forward-loop and return-loop subsystems each have been subdivided into several systems operating in parallel. Results are obtained in the areas of Lyapunov stability, L2input L2output stability, and bounded-input bounded-state stability. Before applying these results to a specific multiloop feedback system, a pseudoenergy analysis must be done on each sub sub-system. Two specific types of systems are so analyzed. The first is a general linear first-order time-varying system. The second is a linear time-varying infinite-dimensional system; the analysis of this system takes the form of a Kalman-Yacubovich-type lemma. By using these two new systems, along with several others that have been analyzed previously, stability theorems for many specific multiloop feedback systems can be proven. One such example is given."

The criterion function is also valid from the estimation theory. The computational algorithm of the procedure is presented herein. Numerical computations of several exampes have shown that the proposed procedure gives satisfactory results even for the short-time observed data."
"The automation of many of the functions currently performed by the controllers and pilots is essential for a safe and efficient air traffic control (ATC) system. A major aspect of the overall ATC system is the guidance and flight control of aircraft. This paper deals with the horizontal guidance of aircraft in and near the terminal area. The problem of guiding an aircraft in minimum time from an arbitrary point to the outer marker is formulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem, and the control law solution is obtained by the application of the maximum principle. It is found that for some initial states the problem is singular. Furthermore, the extremal controls for this problem are not unique. Consequently, the optimal controls must be obtained on the basis of the value of the performance index. The control law is implemented in the form of a digital computer program which computes the optimal trajectory for arbitrary initial conditions."

"This paper deals with the development of variable stability simulation techniques for nonlinear rate-dependent systems. In particular, the model-following and response-feedback modes of dynamic simulation are considered for these systems. The paper begins with a development of variable stability simulation theory for nonlinear rate-dependent systems. Simple examples are given to demonstrate the application of the theory. A model-following flight control system, in which the inertial coupling nonlinearities of the plant and model are taken into account, is then developed. Time histories are included to demonstrate the quality of model following that can be achieved. Finally, linear systems are considered as a special case of the general theory."

In particular, if\\dot{x} = A(t)x + B(t)uis controllable, then so is the perturbed system\\dot{x} = [A(t) + \\epsilon\\tilde{A}(x,t)]x + [B(t) + \\epsilon\\tilde{B}(x,t)]u."

"A strategy suggested by Stackelberg for static economic competition is considered and extended to the case of dynamic games with biased information pattern. This strategy is reasonable when one of the players knows only his own cost function but the other player knows both cost functions.

Two requirements are necessary for the attainment of the desired goal of 1 or 2 degrees (K) in absolute accuracy.

The phase shift angle has a simple mathematical relationship to the driving current values, and is essentially independent of the shape of the magnetization curve of the ferrite material or its variation with temperature. The amount of ferrite material needed for phase shifting is only enough to provide 180 degrees of differential phase shift, and consequently the insertion loss is lower than conventional approaches.

  "It is only recently that measurement of the transient response of microwave systems directly in the time domain has become practicable. It has led to growing interest in the concept of specifying broad-band performance solely by a transient-response measurement. Results of the use of time-domain techniques to obtain, within the range 0.1 to 10 GHz, such data as the S parameters of networks, the constitutive parameters of microwave materials, the driving-point impedance and transfer function of microwave antennas, and the frequency-domain scattering parameters of conducting surfaces in free space are described."
"A computer-controlled production test system for air-borne phased-array microwave modules is described. In the transmit mode accurate measurements of module output power and phase as a function of input power and frequency are made automatically on a pulse basis, and with 4:1 frequency translation from module input to output. Module receiver gain, IF output phase, and noise figure are measured as a function of frequency and local oscillator input power in the receive mode. Other measurements under computer control include dc levels, input and output VSWRS, gain compression, output pulse characteristics, spurious levels, and spectral purity. All test parameters are automatically compared to unit-specification limits as well as reference-standard (unit-to-unit) limits. The system errors are measured periodically through use of calibration standards, stored in memory, and applied as corrections to the measured data on the module under test. Input power, derived from a coherent microwave synthesizer, is automatically adjusted to the required level prior to each test. All test data are recorded on magnetic tape and available to the operator by means of a line printer when desired. The module test fixture incorporates precision (APC)-7 to module adapters, dc connections, an array simulator, and temperature control."
"Two methods for testing short lengths of multimodal circular waveguides, working in the TE/sub 01/ mode accompanied by many spurious modes are described. One method is based on the measurement of the return loss of a resonant one-port cavity; the second one measures the insertion loss of a cavity coupled to the rectangular main waveguide. Automatic data selection and manipulation are emphasized."
"Computer programs are described which generate calibration curves for TE/sub 0np/ and TM/sub 0n0/ cylindrical microwave cavities used in plasma diagnostics. The programs provide data for electron densities well above those at which perturbation theory fails, and can be used for any specified variation of electron density with radius."
"One of the most promising techniques for measuring the electric permittivity at microwave frequencies of thin dielectric materials of the order of 0.1 to 10 /spl mu/m, is the cavity perturbation method. For thin films of this type, it is necessary to determine accurately and display small changes in the resonant frequency and Q factor of the cavity in the presence of the material sample. A circuit for the simultaneous measurement and digital readout of the resonant frequency and Q factor of microwave cavity is described. For the resonant frequency measurement, a very efficient automatic frequency circuit, with a homodyne modulation-detection bridge and frequency stabilization loop, is applied. Theoretical analysis and experiments results with this circuit show that an accuracy of 5x10/sup -7/can be achieved in the resonant frequency measurement. For measuring the Q factor, two similar circuits are described. The technique is based on measuring the phase shift of the envelope of an amplitude modulated microwave signal when this signal is transmitted through a resonant cavity at resonance. Although an accuracy of 0.5 percent in the Q factor can be achieved, it is shown that the main limiting factor in both circuits is the accuracy of phase shift determination at RF frequencies."
"The Q's of a waveguide transmission cavity with and without insertion of a length of waveguide give the insertion loss. Least-squares fitting of transmission versus frequency data have been used to determine Q and resonant frequency f/sub r/ with computer-controlled equipment in an iterative process. Preliminary values of Q and f/sub r/ are used to calculate an improved set of test frequencies, and so on. A rapid least-squares method is described which minimizes truncation errors."
"The impedance measurement of small, microwave lumped elements of the order of 1 mm has been extended up to 12 GHz by a technique in which the frequency and Q of a resonant transmission line are perturbed by the connection of a lumped element. With the use of low-loss resonant coaxial lines, the technique has been applied to the measurement of lumped-element capacitors ranging from 0.4 to 3.6 pF and inductors ranging from 1.1 to 4.3 nH. Conductor Q values for capacitors as high as 1700 at 1.4 GHz and 100 at 12 GHz have been measured and estimates of dielectric Q values for capacitors of over 5000 have been obtained. Single-turn 1.1-nH inductor Q's of 40 at 1 GHz and 90 at 7 GHz have also been measured. The capacitors and single-turn inductors are found to have constant C and L values up to 12 GHz."
"A low-cost automated measuring method is presented to determine the directive gain and relative phase of microwave antenna feed systems in digital form. Using large existing computer facilities, the output data may be used as input data to compute secondary patterns of arbitrary reflector antennas. The use of stepping motors is a key for cheaper and easier operations."
"Techniques for evaluating delay lines with an automatic network analyzer are described. Extremely precise values of the delay can be obtained by an iterative process which uses final measurement frequencies spaced by integral multiples of the reciprocal delay. The magnitude of leakage and triple-delayed transmissions are determined from measurements which are also necessary to obtain accurate values of insertion loss."
"Computer-aided testing is usually performed with a dedicated computer, typically adding a five-digit number to the cost of the test equipment. In such systems the computer sets the test conditions and then records the test results from digital meters. This approach can lead to intolerably slow measurements when the dedicated computer is replaced by a remote time-shared computer. This paper discusses a solution to the problem in which an inexpensive interface (under 1000 dollars) sets the test conditions locally, so that a long string of data can be transmitted to the computer when the telephone line is open. A typical application is the evaluation of high-power microwave transistors, using a standard network analyzer. Connected to a Teletype, the system covers up to 40 frequency points in about 20 s, and displays the calculated and corrected S-parameters within another 20 s. If connected to the computer line through a 1200 Bd line, the system is speeded up by a factor of approximately 10."
"Errors in measurement of S/sub 11/ due to the residual SWR of the slotted line or directional coupler are calculated using admittance considerations. This more complete treatment produces, for some practical conditions, major differences from prior references for phase errors."
"A computer-controlled spectrum surveillance system, and application of such a system to crime countermeasures, is described. The system covers the frequency range of 5 kHz to 12 GHz. All functions are controlled via mini-computer, with output directly compatible with batch processing computers."
"It is shown that for a high-gain circular aperture with linearly polarized and rotationally symmetric excitation the total real radiated power can be expressed as a weighted sum of radiation intensities in N direction, where N is equal to the first integer greater than 2.14D/spl lambda/. D/spl lambda/ is the diameter of the aperture in wavelengths. In an N-point measurement scheme the N directions and the weights involved in the weighted sum of radiation intensities are completely independent of the parameters of the radiation system and can be obtained from the well-known and tabulated properties of the Legendre polynomials. The criterion that N be equal to the first integer greater than 2. 14D/spl lambda/ is independent of any specific distribution in the aperture so long as it is of the type parabolic-on-a-pedestal. Such aperture distributions satisfy most needs and cover typical behavior of actual dish antennas. Even though the result of the theoretical formulation is that the above mentioned criterion for N holds good only for high directivity apertures, computational results show that for D/spl lambda/ as small as 5 the error involved when N satisfies this criterion is less than 0.02 percent, and for D/spl lambda/ equal to 7 the error reduces to 0.005 percent. This not only indicates that the criterion that N be equal to the first integer greater than 2.14D/spl lambda/ holds good even for small values of D/spl lambda/, but it also shows the rapid decrease of error with increase in D/spl lambda/. A knowledge of the total radiated power is required for the determination of gain and radiation efficiency of an aperture. The discrete point approach to the measurement of total radiated power eliminates the need for using the conventional method of graphical integration of radiation patterns for the determination of the total radiated power. The method of graphical integration has been known to give erroneous results for high-gain apertures. Measurement of radiation intensities in the fine sidelobe structure is another source of error in the conventional method. In the discrete point approach the directions in which the radiation intensity need be measured tend to cluster around the normal to the aperture. This means fewer measurements in the fine sidelobe structure."
"A technique is described to determine accurately antenna efficiency by comparing integrated isotropic levels of two antennas, one of which is a lossless reference antenna. Standard automated antenna-range instrumentation was utilized to obtain isotropic levels of Apollo scimitar antennas to /spl plus mn/ 0.1 dB by reducing or eliminating sources of error due to specular ground reflections as well as results based on a single measurement."

"Extensive microwave loss measurements have been performed at frequencies from 1.3 to 11 GHz on below-resonance waveguide Y circulators loaded with a wide variety of ferrite and garnet compositions. Dissipative internal and external magnetic parameters have been measured on the same compositions. Also, dielectric loss measurements have been carried out. Two classes have been distinguished, defined by the following conditions: /spl omega//sub M/ / /spl omega/ /spl les/0.8 and 0.85 /spl les//spl omega//sub M/ / /spl omega/ /spl les/1.05. It is inferred that the (insertion loss) IL of such devices is independent of /spl Delta/H and mainly depends on the internal dissipative susceptibility x/sub i/\" and on the dielectric loss tan /spl delta/. The relation of the IL versus x/sub i/\" and tan /spl delta/ in the case /spl omega//sub M/ / /spl omega/ /spl les/0.8 is independent of frequency and given by the semiempirical equation IL= 10 log/sub 10/ (1-2.85 x/sub i/\" - 1.60 tan /spl delta/ - 0.017)/sup -1/."
"The relative convergence phenomenon that occurs in the numerical solution of the integral equation for the iris discontinuity problem is studied both analytically and numerically. It is shown that the solution for the aperture field can be highly dependent upon the manner in which the kernel and the unknown function are approximated in the process of constructing a matrix equation by the moment method. An analytical explanation is provided for the above phenomenon and the theoretical predictions are verified numerically. Also incIuded is a suggested numerical algorithm for detecting and alleviating the relative convergence behavior for more general problems."
"A microwave measuring instrument which is capable of producing a visual or graphical record of the reflection coefficient /spl Gamma/ along the length of a waveguide component is described. The principle of operation is the evaluation, in real time by an analog method, of the Fourier transform of /spl Gamma/ as a function of frequency, resulting in /spl Gamma/ as a function of distance."
"The operation of a longitudinally magnetized fully filled square-waveguide reciprocal-ferrite phase shifter is described. The frequency characteristics of the phase shifter are predicted and measured. An error analysis, including rotational errors incurred in wide-band operation and manufacturing tolerances, is used to predict the loss performance of the device. The effect of the ferrite parameters and the waveguide geometry on phase-shifter performance may be calculated using this analysis. The variation of the phase shift with temperature as well as high-power effects are presented, and design considerations, including choice of ferrite saturation magnetization for wide-band performance, are discussed. Experimental results closely confirm the key aspects of this theory."
"The actual technology for the production of transistors is now suitable for bipolar transistors in the 10-GHz range. In order to obtain amplifier circuits in this microwave range, the knowledge of the exact equivalent circuit is essential. A computer method for the determination of the equivalent network is given. The final application and accuracy are shown for a particular microwave transistor."
"Cavity perturbation techniques offer a very sensitive highly versatile means for studying the complex microwave conductivity of a bulk material. A knowledge of the cavity coupling factor in the absence of perturbation, together with the change in the reflected power and the cavity resonance frequency shift, are adequate for the determination of the material properties. This eliminates the need to determine the Q-factor change with perturbation which may lead to appreciable error, especially in the presence of mismatch loss. The measurement accuracy can also be improved by a proper choice of the cavity coupling factor prior to the perturbation."
"The use of a rectangular waveguide partially loaded with electrooptic material as a laser beam phase modulator is analyzed theoretically. The characteristic equation, fields, power, and attenuation are obtained in terms of normalized parameters. Design procedure of the modulator is given with particular reference to KDP."
"A theoretical foundation is presented for the efficient computation of first- and second-order sensitivities of networks with respect to network parameters in terms of wave variables. The concept of the adjoint network is used. First-order sensitivity formulas for a wide variety of elements are presented, including lumped and uniformly distributed elements, active and passive elements, and reciprocal and nonreciprocal elements. Parameters include electrical quantities, geometrical dimensions, and frequency. It is shown how gradients related to wave-based least pth and minimax objective functions can be computed. A comparison with a method which avoids the need for analysis of adjoint networks is made. Applications in the computer-aided design of networks using efficient gradient minimization methods are envisaged."
"The analysis of the attenuation due to ohmic losses in periodic linear arrays of metallic cylinders, ribbons, and slots in a metallic ground plane is presented. Calculations indicate that the loss per unit length of the ribbon and cylinder arrays is comparable to that of a standard rectangular waveguide operated in the TE/sub 10/ mode. With a proper choice of parameters, the loss per unit length of the slot array can be brought to within a factor of 2 of that of rectangular waveguides."
"The design and development of a variety of microwave integrated circuit oscillators for use in integrated broad-band high-performance receiving systems is described. Examples of various thin-film microstrip oscillators directed to this application are provided including: 1) fixed-frequency Gunn-effect oscillators covering C to Ku band; 2) X-band varactor-tuned Gunn-effect oscillators providing up to 15 percent tuning bandwidth; 3) S-band step-tuned transistor oscillator assembly with better than half-octave digital tuning range; 4) L-band varactor-tuned transistor oscillator with almost an octave tuning range."
"The design and development of microwave integrated-circuit (MIC) tunnel-diode amplifiers for use in integrated broad-band high-performance receivers is described. In particular, this paper describes the design, construction, and performance of thin-film microstrip tunnel-diode amplifiers operating in the 8-to 12- and 6-to 8-GHz bands, respectively, with noise figures in the 5-to 7-dB range."
"Formulas derived by mode summation give the six B- and H-field components in the various air and dielectric regions of a slot-line cross section. These formulas are valid except when very close to the slot, where approximations in the analysis cause a large error. A quasi-static method yields a second set of formulas that apply near the slot. Thus the field is determined satisfactorily in all parts of the cross section. Graphs of the H components show that elliptical polarization exists, with the best approach to circularity near the slot and near the opposite surface of the substrate. Quantitative field data are useful for analysis and design of slot-line components, such as ferrite devices, dielectric-resonator filters, directional couplers, and broad-band transitions to coaxial line or microstrip."
"The construction and experimental results of a highly stabilized K/sub a/-band Gunn oscillator are described. The frequency stability is 3x10/sup -5/ at 25 GHz over the temperature range from 0 to 50/spl deg/C. An output power of more than 20 mW has been obtained in the frequency range up to 30 GHz. The frequency-saturation effect is also described."
"A computerized optimization technique is employed to provide design values for broad-band parametric amplifiers. Some results of the procedure are presented."
"Expressions are derived for computing loss in coupled TEM structures in terms of complex even- and odd-mode propagation constants and characteristic impedances of the lines. The attenuation due to conductor (series) and dielectric (shunt) losses in a given structure can be determined utilizing these expressions. The results may be particularly useful for computing conductor loss in microwave circuits with a large number of sections used in traveling-wave devices and as microwave circuit elements. The method is applied to some typical structures for computing conductor loss."
"The renormalized perturbation method is applied to the inhomogeneously loaded waveguide. The second-order term in the usual Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation method is divergent with respect to increasing the concerned mode number. Introducing the phenomenological parameter by analogy to the quantum electro-dynamics, we have the nondivergent second-order perturbation term."
"The possibility of using the nonlinearity of the Gunn device current-voltage characteristic to provide microwave power limiting is discussed. Initial pulsed and CW results are presented which demonstrate limiting action."
"Top-wall and multiple-branch waveguide couplers were developed as hybrid junctions for millimeter wavelengths, and their electrical characteristics were measured. For construction of the 55-GHz top-wall coupler, electroforming techniques were used; for the 94-GHz branch-guide coupler, the branch lines were cut directly into the wall of the main guide. Copper losses were less than 0.2 dB for the two types of couplers."
"The operation of a single Fairchild FD-300 diode at approximately 40-percent efficiency is reported. Peak power output was 90 W at 502 MHz. These diodes are of particular interest because they are exceptionally inexpensive commercially available diodes which have been found to exhibit TRAPATT behavior."
"A method for measuring scattering coefficients of a multiport waveguide junction is presented. It is based on the application of Deschamps' graphical technique to reduced multiport junctions, and analysis of measurements done with either matched or nearly matched loads terminated at all but the input and output ports. Averaging and least-square fitting are introduced to reduce errors from measurements."
"The mode chart of the E-plane junction circulator is given. The geometry considered consists of two ferrite disks placed against the narrow walls at the plane of symmetry of a symmetrical 3-port E-plane waveguide junction. It is experimentally found to exhibit two modes. One of these modes has a resonant frequency which increases with the spacing between the two ferrite disks. The other mode has a resonant frequency which decreases with the spacing between the disks. Both modes are independent of the disk spacing when the spacing is large. It is also found that the frequency of both modes is proportional to the thickness of the ferrite disks. Finally, circulators obtained by magnetizing each of the two modes circulate in opposite directions. Experimental results on a circulator obtained in this way are included."
"Phase errors incurred by a surface acoustic wave propagating through or generated by an apodized interdigital array have been found to cause severe distortions of the filter response. The amount of error is a function of the piezoelectric coupling constant of the delay material and it is found that the distortions are most severe in high-coupling materials. A simple modification to the current method of array design is presented which corrects this phase error. Experimental results for a pulse-compression loop using apodized lithium-niobate surface-wave filters are presented which demonstrate the effectiveness of this method of phase correction."
"A two-step design procedure for the accurate synthesis of a junction circulator is given. The procedure is accurate to within a few decibels for isolation in the 20- to 40-dB range."
"A compact subsidiary-resonance limiter with a dynamic range of greater than 200 kW is described. The structure consists of a multilayer ferrite-dielectric \"sandwich\" placed on the narrow wall of a reduced-height reduced-width rectangular waveguide. Below-the-threshold insertion loss is less than 0.5 dB over the 5.4-5.9-GHz band, and the threshold level is about 20 W."

 "A theoretical analysis is presented of a solid-state power amplifier consisting of a unidirectional transmission line loaded by a series of negative-resistance diodes. Numerical calculations of the large-signal amplifier characteristics are carried out assuming a cubic nonlinear relationship between the diode current and the RF voltage. Diode parameters used in these calculations are chosen to approximate those of available IMPATT diodes. A bandwidth in excess of 30 percent and a saturated CW power output of more than 20 watts are predicted for 10-diode amplifiers."
"An analysis of the modes that can propagate in a coaxial waveguide with Iossless reactive guiding surfaces is presented. The cases where both the surfaces are either inductive or capacitive and the case where one of the surfaces is capacitive and the other is inductive are discussed. The results show that, in general, there are two surface waves and an infinite number of waveguide modes. Whereas all the waveguide modes show the cut off phenomenon, the surface waves may either propagate down to zero frequency or get transformed into the lowest order waveguide mode at certain critical frequencies determined by the structure parameters."
"An ordered array of metallic posts is proposed as an embedding network for lumped devices at microwave frequencies. The individual metallic posts, terminated in a lumped device, extend across a parallel-plane transmission line excited by the TEM mode. In the analysis the impedance discontinuity for an individual terminated metallic post in a transmission line bounded on two sides by electric walls and two sides by magnetic walls is evaluated. Design concepts useful in employing these results with a two-dimensional array of metallic posts terminated with semiconductor devices are described."
"The design of a class of impedance-transforming filters in the form of very compact and convenient mixed lumped and distributed ladder networks is presented. The synthesis utilizes the distributed prototype technique introduced in a previous paper, but here a new approximation function appropriate to the impedance transformer problem is derived. In addition to combining the properties of an impedance transformer and a low-pass filter, the new circuit represents a solution to the problem of short-line matching to an extreme impedance value without using extreme impedance values in the transformer. Broad-band designs are tabulated for a wide range of parameters. A discussion of the application of the technique in the design of mixed lumped and distributed broad-band matching networks is included. A 50-10-/spl Omega/ transformer was designed for the band 3.5-7.0 GHz, having a voltage standing-wave ratio of 1.15 and giving an attenuation >20 dB in the band 10.5-21.0 GHz. The length of this transformer is 0.875 in, and the experimental results showed excellent agreement with theory."
"A technique is presented for accurately determinhg the dielectric constant of microwave materials. The concept is to resonate a cutoff circular-waveguide cavity by inserting the dielectric-disk sample. Unlike most dielectric measurement techniques which rely on perturbation methods, this one determines the dielectric constant from the absolute measurement of the resonant frequency. Also, the use of a cutoff cavity prevents false dielectric constant readings by eliminating spurious resonances."
"A simple formula useful for predicting leakage through a circular hole array in a metallic flat plate is presented. A correction is given for plate thickness. The formula is applicable to arrays having either a 60/spl deg/ (staggered) or 90/spl deg/ (square) hole pattern, but is restricted to the case of 1) an obliquely incident plane wave with the E field polarized normal to the plane of incidence, and 2) large transmission loss. When theoretical values were compared to experimental data obtained on test samples having transmission losses greater than 20 dB, the agreement between theory and experiment was typically better than 1 dB at S band and 2 dB at X band."
"The behavior of the Brillouin diagram /spl omega/ versus /spl beta//sub z/ is analyzed for axially magnetized gyrotropic waveguides in the vicinity of the hybrid frequencies /spl omega//sub k/ and /spl omega//sub i/. Starting from the exact dispersion relation for the modes in the waveguides under consideration it is shown that 1) the dispersion curves terminate at discrete cutoff points located along the /spl omega/ = spl omega//sub k/, /spl omega//sub i/ line and 2) the group velocity at these points is zero. These results modify the behavior of the dispersion curves existing in the literature."
"S-band comb-line filters can be tuned over a frequency range of approximately 200 percent of the design frequency. A simple technique is also described that compensates for impedance match and coupling deficiencies associated with the filter."

"Three principal categories have been known in electrical circuitry so far. They are the lumped-constant (0-dimensional) circuit, distributed-constant (1-dimensional) circuit, and waveguide (3-dimensional) circuit. The planar circuit to be discussed in general in this paper is a circuit category that should be positioned as a 2-dimensional circuit. It is defined as an \"electrical circuit having dimensions comparable to the wavelength in two directions, but much less thickness in one direction.\" The main subject of this paper is the computer analysis of an arbitrarily shaped, triplate planar circuit. It is shown that a computer analysis based upon a contour-integral solution of the wave equation offers an accurate and efficient tool in the design of the planar circuit. Results of some computer calculations are described. It is also shown that the circuit parameters can be derived directly from Green's function of the wave equation when the shape of the circuit is relatively simple. Examples of this sort of analysis are also shown for comparison with the computer analysis."
"The validity of considering the LSE/sub 20/-mode propagation threshold as the limiting factor in selecting rectangular-wave-guide ferrite-phase-shifter dimensions is examined theoretically and experimentally using a dielectric model. Depending on the effective dielectric constant of the loading material, it is shown that the LSE/sub 20/-mode cutoff may, in many cases, be exceeded without introducing spurious mode resonances. In addition, the effect of magnetization on the y-independent modal cutoffs is investigated. It is concluded that the dielectric model represents a worst case condition as far as higher order mode propagation is concerned."
"A procedure is described whereby narrow-bandpass waveguide filters having ripple in both the passbands and stopbands can be synthesized in the form of coupled waveguide cavities. Orthogonal modes in square or circular waveguides are employed to enable negative coupling elements to be realized. As a consequence, very compact filters can be constructed. Experimental results on an 8-cavity orthogonal-mode narrow-bandpass filter are shown to agree well with theory."
"The behavior of nonlinear power amplifiers using IMPATTdiodes in both stable and injection-locked modes was investigated theoretically and experimentally. A method of graphical interpretation of the characteristics of negative-resistance diode simplifiers, based on the large-signal diode admittance chart, is presented. The characteristics of the simplified model of the reflection-type amplifier using an X-band Read-type IMPATTdiode have been evaluated. The experimental results of power amplification using an X-band Si IMPATTdiode in both stable and injection-locked modes under various circuit conditions are given. It was shown that nonlinearity of the IMPATT diode susceptance causes distortions in the amplification and injection-locking characteristics."
"The problem of determining the scattered electromagnetic fields when a dielectric step discontinuity is placed in a waveguide is considered. Although an exact method of solution is not presently known, the recently introduced modified residue-calculus technique (MRCT) can be successfully extended to obtain a very accurate and numerically efficient approximate solution of the semi-infinite dielectric step. A still further extension of the modified residue-calculus method yields the approximate solution for the case of a finite dielectric step. A unique advantage of the present methods is that the degree of accuracy obtained is independent of the relative permittivity of the dielectric material and of the frequency. Thus very high permittivities or frequencies can be considered without an attendant increase in computational complexity. Numerical data are presented which confirm the accuracy of the method."
"The first-order perturbation formula is used to obtain the attenuation factor of different TE and TM modes in hollow conducting elliptical waveguides. Normalized attenuation charts give the attenuation factor for almost each possible combination of cross-sectional dimensions, nonmagnetic wall material, and frequency of operation."
"A nonreciprocal analog-latching phase-shifter design at X-band is described. The device has been operated up to 250 W of average power and 50 kW of peak power. Direct liquid cooling is implemented, pumping FC-78,/sup1/ a dielectric coolant, through the center slot of the ferrite toroid."
"Two Yig-tuned Gunn oscillators/sup 1/ have been frequency locked over a 3-GHz range in X-band. Injected power into the locked oscillator was approximately 10 dB below its output power. Analog frequency-tracking circuitry was used together with phase-comparator feedback to achieve output phase which remained within /spl plus mn/10/spl deg/ over a 1.2 GHz bandwidth. Controlled phase shifting was obtained by applying dc voltages within the feedback loop."
"Because of the relative simplicity of measurement of scattering parameters of active two-ports at frequencies up to the lower microwave region, investigations have been made into the application of these parameters to the design of UHF amplifiers. The theory of generalized scattering parameters has been developed by Kurokawa, applied to two-port power-flow analysis by Bodway, and used in the design of a single-stage UHF amplifier by Froehner. In this last paper, the bandwidth limitations imposed by the matching networks were not considered, nor was the capacitive matching arrangement to a purely resistive load fully developed. Both of these topics are the subject of this short paper, in which the relevant design expressions are also given."
"A low-cost microstrip 50-/spl Omega/ termination is described having a maximum VSWR of 1.46 (including the mismatch contributed by a microstrip launcher) from 1 to 18 GHz. It consists of a thin-film chip resistor with a matching structure. Experimental resistor characterization, equivalent-circuit modeling, and matching considerations are presented."
"Summary form only given, as follows. The propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves in hollow, perfectly conducting waveguides has been studied recently by J.G. Kretzschmar [\"Wave propagation in hollow conducting elliptical waveguides,\" ibid., vol. MTT-18, pp. 547-554, Sept. 1970] in an excellent paper. Extensive numerical data are presented for the cutoff wavelength on 19 successive modes. The paper is also of interest in other fields of applied sciences, since in the case of TM modes the problem is mathematically equivalent to that of an elliptical cylinder, subject to a sudden temperature change at the outer surface of the cylinder [E.T. Kirkpatrick & W.F. Stokey, \"Transient heat conduction in elliptica plates and cylinders,\" J. Heat Transfer, Trans. ASME, pp. 54-60, Feb. 1959]. The numerical evaluation of the solution requires the zeros of ordinary and modified Mathieu functions and the calculation of integrals involving the functions. Kirkpatrick and Stokey's paper describes also the evaluation of the temperature equation by the use of a digital computer giving results for ellipses having eccentricities of 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.90. Kretzschmar uses a Bessel-function product-series approach, while Kirkpatrick and Stokey make use of a hyperbolic function series. It should also be pointed out that only the even TM0mp(m = 0, 2, 4 ... , p = 1, 2, ... ) in Kretzschmar have their equivalent in Kirkpatrick."
"The instantaneous frequency-measuring receiver (IFR) is becoming widely known to microwaye systems engineers, but as a consequence of the defense applications its origins are obscure. The pioneering work on the phase-discriminator technique, which is the basis of most modern IFR systems, was done in the Mullard Research Laboratories, Red Hill, Surrey, England, UK. A brief account of the work and a record of one of the lirst signal observations with this type of receiver is provided. In concluding the author illustrates a signal display recorded in 1958 which is believed to be the first observation of signals with a balanced phase discriminator IFR. The receiver operated over an octave band from 2 to 4 GHz with one discriminator circuit. It is measuring five pulsed signals, one of which is a multifrequency transmission."

"A lossless distributed rectangular structure, composed of a dielectric layer interposed between two perfectly conductive metallic layers, is considered. This structure is endowed with two ports, whose positions and widths are variable and is connected to the environment through uniform transmission lines. A procedure is exposed to obtain the impedance matrix at the terminals of the transmission lines. The existence of transmission zeros and of filtering properties is demonstrated."
"Formulas and graphs are presented for the effective relative permeability and the filling factors of magnetic substrates in microstrip. Both the propagation and the magnetic loss filling factors are included. In the calculation of these quantities, use was made of the filling factors for dielectric substrates obtained from Wheeler's analysis and a duality relationship between magnetic and dielectric substrates derived in this paper."
"Experimental data taken on microstrip built on ferrite and garnet substrates are presented and compared with theoretical values calculated from formulas derived in a previous paper which were extended to gyromagnetic media. Good agreement has been obtained between experiment and theory. In particular the observed increase in wave attenuation at frequencies near /spl omega//sub m/ is fully explained when the frequency dependence of the characteristic impedance is taken into account."
"Design figures are presented for four types of diode phase shifters: switched line, reflection, loaded line, and a new type using lumped-element high-pass and low-pass circuits. Comparison of their bandwidths shows that most of them can work over an octave bandwidth."
"An equivalent network is presented for symmetric inductive irises in rectangular waveguides. This model exactly describes the effects of finite thickness and interaction via higher order modes due to the presence of neighboring irises, as in practical waveguide filters."
"Eigenfunctions, eigenvalues, and attenuation constants in waveguides are determined for the square with rounded corners, and for the cigar-shaped rectangle with rounded ends. These cross sections allow, by continuous variation of a parameter, the investigation of the deformation of the modes and attenuation curves of a circular waveguide. Particular attention is given to the H/sub01/ mode and its remarkable attenuation curve."
"The introduction of a double complex-number system and the combining of the transverse field components into a compact composite structure enable the wave equation to be expressed in a form in which certain mathematical combinations of field components appear as entities completely decoupled from each other. Hence the equations can be solved for these combinations and ultimately for the components themselves. The method appears limited to guides of constant cross section and of either 1) isotropic medium and curved axis, or 2) axially anisotropic nonreciprocal medium and straight axis."
"A mode chart and a general expression for the unloaded quality factor of an elliptic microstrip resonator operating in transverse or radial TM modes are presented."
"It is well-known that one can determine the efficiency of a microwave 2-port by measuring the reflection coefficient /splGamma//sub 1/ at the input port when the output port is terminated by a sliding short circuit. The locus of /spl Gamma//sub 1/ is a circle whose radius equals the efficiency /spl eta//sub 2m/ for energy entering port 2 when port 1 is terminated in a nonreflecting load. Similarly /spl eta//sub 1m/ is the radius of the circle when port is terminated in a sliding short circuit. This note describes a procedure for obtaining, from the same measured data, new reflection coefficients /spl Gamma//sub 1N/ and /spl Gamma//sub 2N/, whose circular loci have radii R/sub 1N/ and R/sub 2N/ which give the efficiencies of the 2-port when connected to an arbitrary load of reflection coefficient /spl Gamma//sub L/. Thus the /spl Gamma//sub 1/ or /spl Gamma//sub 2/ data may be used to obtain the efficiency of the 2-port when terminated in any arbitrary load. The method is potentially more accurate than the 3-point method since errors can be reduced by drawing a circle through many measured points."
"The possibility of using inexpensive commercial glass mirrors for refocusing and redirecting millimeter-wave beams has already been investigated; such beams would be useful for distributing large quantities of information in cities. Interference is expected to be minimal as a result of the close confinement of the beams. We report preliminary experiments made in the 50-55-GHz band, using a swept backward-wave oscillator (BWO) as a source."

"We consider the coupled line equations for two-mode random media in which both modes travel in the same (forward) direction as a model for multimode millimeter waveguides and optical fibers, in which mode conversion at imperfections occurs primarily in the forward direction. Some exact general properties satisfied by the transfer function and the impulse response of such a system are given for an arbitrary coupling coefficient. A random stationary coupling coefficient with statistically independent successive values, and consequently a white spectrum (e.g., a white Gaussian or a Poisson noise), permits exact determination of transmission statistics; we obtain first- and second-order statistics in the time and frequency domains. No perturbation or other approximations are made in any of the above results, which are obtained directly from the coupled line equations. These results are used to study signal distortion in long guides. By straightforward extension of this work more complicated calculations can treat more forward modes, but not backward modes or nonwhite coupling coefficient spectra. In this paper the coupling coefficient is assumed frequency independent, and under certain conditions the signal distortion decreases as the mode conversion increases. In practical cases the coupling coefficients are frequency dependent and the above behavior is modified; the present work is extended to this important case in a companion paper."
"We obtain exactly the covariance of the signal-signal and signal-spurious mode transfer functions of the coupled line equations with two forward-traveling modes, white random coupling with statistically independent successive values (e.g., white Gaussian or Poisson coupling), and a coupling coefficient that varies with the frequency of the signals on the line. No perturbation or other approximations are made in this work. Time-domain statistics for the corresponding impulse responses are obtained for moderate fractional bandwidths. These results are extensions of a similar treatment for frequency-independent coupling coefficients, given in a companion paper. If the coupling were independent of frequency, the signal distortion would ultimately decrease as the coupling increased, approaching zero as the coupling approached infinity. The frequency dependence of the coupling coefficient prevents the distortion from approaching zero; the optimum coupling, which achieves minimum signal distortion, is independent of guide length. Millimeter waveguides and optical fibers with random straightness deviations have coupling coefficients inversely proportional to the frequency. The above results yield the optimum random straightness deviation for such a guide. More forward modes can be treated in a straightforward way by more complicated calculations."
"There is a constant need for diode circuits employing rectangular waveguide. Coupling of the diode to the guide by using an inductive post is a popular method. The microwave circuit analysis of the equivalent circuit has been explored by complete theoretical analyses in the literature, but the results have been sufficiently difficult to apply that, in practice, recourse is often made to empiric characterization. This paper derives a simplified equivalent circuit based on a small perturbation approximation. The method is verified by experiment and is then used to evaluate a practical Gunn oscillator cavity."
"The class of waveguides with rectangular, elliptical, and parabolic cross sections and their transition shapes has been investigated. The transition shapes have been described by hyperelliptic functions. By a numerical procedure based on the finite-element method, the cutoff wavelength and the mode patterns of 12 of the lowest-order TM modes and 14 of the lowest-order TE modes of this class have been found. On the basis of the investigation, a mode-classifying system for arbitrary waveguide cross sections is suggested."
"The functional whose stationary point is furnished by the solution of Poisson's equation under mixed, Neumann, and Dirichlet boundary conditions within a homogeneous region is presented. The Dirichlet condition is formulated as a natural one, thus removing a considerable restriction on acceptable trial functions. Although the approach has been suggested previously, examples of its application to partial differential equations are unavailable. The practical significance of the method and its algorithmic simplicity is illustrated by means of tests on a square region. The natural Dirichlet condition is seen to be satisfied as well as the natural Neumann boundary condition. The equivalent functional for the Helmholtz eigenvalue problem is stated."
"Although microstrip transmission lines have been widely used in microwave integrated circuits, the discontinuity structures in the microstrip transmission lines such as a gap, an abruptly ended strip conductor, and so on, have hardly been analyzed. An analytical method and numerical results for a gap capacitance in the microstrip transmission line are described. The equivalent circuit parameters are formulated with three-dimensional Green's functions, based on a variational principle. The numerical results are in good agreement with the published experimental data. The fringing effect of an abruptly ended strip conductor is also investigated."
"Two different analytical methods, the complex conjugate input admittance approach and the eigenvalue analysis, show the possibility of building a fast switching lumped-element circulator. In conventional switching circulators, switching is achieved by changing the required magnetic biasing field. The proposed principle, which is valid for circulators of all types, is especially interesting for lumped-element circulators where the switching may be accomplished by simply changing two capacitor values. The capacitors could be switched by varying voltages on semiconductors thus permitting very fast switching. The analysis has been experimentally verified. No attempt to obtain optimization of a specific design was made."
"It is shown that a nonlinear microwave circuit can easily be represented by a feedback model. This formalistic identity with nonlinear control systems suggests that methods and results can be borrowed from nonlinear control theory. The describing function technique, a concept that has been developed to a high degree of sophistication in control theory, is applied to the problem of phase-locking of microwave oscillators. The use of describing functions in the study of nonlinear microwave circuits may give a simple conceptual understanding of locking phenomena, for example, and thereby reduce computational efforts."
"Earlier work on the analysis and experimental performance of 3-port and 4-port waveguide circulators over the waveguide bandwidth has shown some discrepancies. The computed performance tended to be too optimistic. It is shown that an extension of Davies' analysis to include higher order cylindrical modes and evanescent modes in the waveguide arms yields excellent correlation between theory and practice."
"A consistent normal-mode theory for coupled uniform transmission lines is developed which properly accounts for the fact that some propagation constants may be equal. Explicit responses are calculated. The results are interpreted in terms of transmission-line networks which consist of simple lines and which are coupled via conductor sharing."
"The characteristics of new strip lines (i.e., a single strip conductor and a two symmetrical strip-conductor coplanar-type strip line, which consist of single- or two-center strip conductors and ground plates on a dielectric substrate and outer ground conductor) are calculated by the relaxation method. The effect of the outer ground conductor on these lines is analyzed, and the characteristic impedance and velocity ratio are determined. The characteristic impedance is determined experimentally, and the maximum values of the discrepancies compared with the calculated values of each of the lines are 2.0-3.0 percent."
"The electromagnetic boundary value problem of two waveguides coupled by an aperture or an aperture in a waveguide radiating into free space may be described by an integral equation. An analytical solution to this integral equation cannot be readily found due to the complexity of the kernel. However, extremely useful results may be obtained if the method of moments is employed to reduce the integral equation to a matrix equation which can be solved by known methods. In this short paper, series and shunt slots in a rectangular waveguide are analyzed using this technique."
"Locking equations are derived which account for nonsinusoidal device waveforms. Locking bandwidth is related to Q values and device voltage amplitudes. Effective Q values are calculated for cavities having tuned and untuned harmonics."
  "This program gives, from an exact analytic theory, either a characteristic parameter of the sample or resonance frequency for all eigenmodes which may exist in the loaded cavity."

"Equations are presented that express noise-to-carrier ratio and rms frequency deviation of a negative-resistance oscillator with a multiple-resonant circuit in terms of effective available noise power densities of both 1/f and white-noise sources, an effective saturation factor, and an appropriate Q/sub L/ of the oscillator. Experimental evaluation of the noise parameters in Gunn and avalanche oscillators by use of these equations is described. AM and FM noise measurements have been made on X-band Gunn oscillators and Si and GaAs avalanche oscillators for frequency off carriers extending from 1 kHz to 10 MHz. Both 1/f and white noise have been observed in these oscillators. The validity of the above equations has been verified for Gunn oscillators from the dependence of the noise spectra on Q/sub L/. For Gunn oscillators and Si and GaAs avalanche oscillators, the effective noise-temperature ratio for white noise, N/kT/sub 0/, has been found to be 23~29, 41~51, and 38~44 dB, and the effective saturation factor to be 2~2.9, 0.5~2.4, and 2, respectively. An increase of N/kT/sub 0/ with the RF voltage across the diode has been observed in Si avalanche oscillators. Parameters for 1/f noise have also been evaluated approximately."
"The first-order spinwave instability under perpendicular pumping at large signal power in an hexagonal ferrite ellipsoid with planar anisotropy biased in the easy plane is studied. The nonlinear coupling coefficient is obtained in terms of the physical variables of the unstable spinwaves and the uniform mode magnetization such as the orientation and ellipticity of the unstable spinwaves, the coordinates of the spinwave propagation vector k, and the uniform mode ellipticity. Results obtained using a computer in the case of a sphere are included. Also included are experimental results on the coincidence region with the dc field in the easy plane and with the dc field out of the easy plane. This latter arrangement leads to a new tunable coincidence limiter."
"A program written for the Hewlett-Packard automatic network analyzer permits the S-parameter eigenvalue phases and magnitudes to be displayed. The thus measured eigenvalues of a lumped-element circulator lead to an improved equivalent circuit which explains the observed \"double hump\" characteristic. The influence of different circuit parameters on the eigenvalues is measured and found in good agreement with the author's previously published theory. It is concluded from this theory and the measurements that, for the lossy circulator in general, maximum isolation, return loss, and minimum forward loss do not occur at the same frequency."
"Broad-band coupling between a resistive source and a resonant load is considered for coupling networks consisting of a uniform transmission line of impedance Z/sub I/ and length equal to a quarter wavelength at the load resonant frequency. An approximate analysis is used to show that either maximally flat or ripple insertion loss frequency response can be obtained by proper choice of Z/sub I/, and the 3-dB bandwidth obtained in either case is always greater than 1/Q. Depending on the ratio of load and source resistances, the bandwidth may be greater than 1 octave. Network design curves for maximally flat operation with a variety of load parameters are computed without approximation. The design of lumped element approximations for the transmission line network is also described."
"A comprehensive circuit model characterization of dispersive interdigital transducers with nonuniform electrode spacing is presented. The model is an extension of a three-port circuit which has been useful for representing periodic transducers. The extended model includes the effects of strong piezoelectric coupling whereby the acoustic waves and electric circuits interact, and it also accounts for reflections of acoustic waves which result from perturbations of the crystal surface by the metal electrodes. The inclusion of the latter effect is shown to be essential for explaining observed levels of triple-transit echos in filters and delay lines. The circuit model is used to derive a transducer design procedure which determines the electrode positions and the anodization function (acoustic aperture taper) required to reproduce a desired waveform. This procedure is applicable to the design of weighted dispersive filters and broad-band nondispersive delay lines. In order to verify the theory a low-loss octave-bandwidth nondispersive delay line was designed using linear FM dispersive transducers on YZ LiNbO/sub 3/. The performance of this device was found to be in good agreement with the circuit model predictions."
"A theoretical study of tapping a Love wave in an isotropic microacoustic surface waveguide is given. The surface Love wave is tapped by partial transduction into a bulk wave at a discontinuity. It is shown here that, by careful design of the discontinuity, the converted bulk wave power and the radiation pattern may be controlled. General formulas are derived for the calculation of these important characteristics from a relatively general surface contour deformation."
"The present investigation is motivated by the problem of coupling Rayleigh waves between adjacent substrates when either substrate is nonpiezoelectric, in which case it becomes necessary to resort to some mechanical means to achieve this coupling. The use of a fluid coupling layer has been investigated and experimentally demonstrated elsewhere, while the use of a solid layer, with its inherently greater mechanical stability, has also been proposed. In this work, the operating characteristics of a specific solid-layer structure are predicted on the basis of a theoretical analysis, which furnishes the propagation characteristics and field structure of the waves which may be guided by a solid layer between two identical solids."
"Design techniques and equivalent circuits are presented for constructing a printed-circuit narrow-bandwidth complementary triplexer filter. The techniques and circuits described allow the construction of contiguous-band multichannel filters using printed circuits with no shorted stubs. A unit was designed and constructed to give a three-percent relative bandwidth for each separate channel. The agreement between theory and experiment was in the range of measurement accuracy."
"In a previous paper, Felsen and Kahn showed that the scattering matrix of small apertures and obstacles in multimode waveguide regions is conveniently calculated for general lossless structures, but observed that the scattering matrix does not satisfy the conservation-of-energy requirement. It is also to be noted that the scattering parameters could become much larger than unity or even infinite for frequencies near or at the cutoff of the coupled modes. A method is presented in this correspondence to implement the lossless condition so that the resultant scattering matrix satisfies the conservation-of-energy requirement and, consequently, can be represented as a Iossless equivalent circuit for all frequencies. The corresponding impedance, admittance, and transfer matrices for general lossless symmetrical structures are given in compact form directly in terms of the scattering parameters."
"By means of this program the complex eigenvalues of the permeability tensor of magnetized ferrites can be calculated from measurements of the propagation constants of right- and left-handed rotating HE/sub 11/ waves in circular cylindrical waveguides containing axial longitudinally magnetized ferrite rods."

"A Yagi-Uda array of monopoles is embedded in the dielectric of a dielectric image line, with the driven element fed from coaxial cable below the metallic ground plane, in order to launch the dipole-mode surface wave. The launching efficiency is a function of the array length and is relatively independent of the transverse dimension. With a six-element array, a launching efficiency of 62 percent has been achieved over an 18-percent bandwidth at 2.2 GHz. A design procedure for such arrays is described and experimental verification is given."
"The matrix methods are applied to three-dimensional microstrip problems with emphasis upon the general problem of discontinuities in microstrip. Discontinuities considered are 1) open circuits, 2) change of width, and 3) gap in microstrip. Also, the capacitance of rectangular sections of microstrip is computed. Computed data agree well with experiment and data in the literature."
"To determine the capacitance between two rectangular parallel plates separated by a dielectric sheet, the charge distribution on the plates is formulated in terms of a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind. This equation is solved numerically by a projective method using polynomial approximants. The resulting capacitance values are given in normalized graphical form, permitting capacitance determination for any practical values of dielectric constant and geometric parameters to within a few percent."
"The integral equations that describe the charge distribution near an open-circuited microstrip end are formulated and subsequently solved by a projective method. The solution hinges on development of computationally efficient techniques for dealing with the singularities that occur by special quadrature formulas. The necessary formulas are described and tabulated. These techniques are then used to find open-circuit capacitance values for microstrip. It is found that the curves of excess capacitance versus width are easily describable by empirical equations; such equations are presented, along with the curves themselves. For strip widths between 0.1 and 10 times the substrate thickness and for dielectric constants in the range 1-51, the given data are believed accurate to within a few percent."
"The propagation of electromagnetic waves inside circular waveguides lined with artificial anisotropic dielectric is investigated. Our investigation shows that the dominant hybrid electromagnetic (HEM/sub 11/ ) mode possesses a transverse deflecting field over the aperture of the structure and can be used as a transverse deflecting mode in a particle separator with ultrahigh energy. Expressions for power, attenuation, and transverse shunt impedance are obtained, and the effects of changing in loading on these various quantities are studied and presented in graphs."
"An analytical discussion of the mode property and the scattering loss of a two-dimensional dielectric waveguide with gradual refractive-index distribution in the transverse direction is presented. To describe scattering loss, a transverse correlation as well as an axial correlation of the irregular variation of the refractive index have been used. The field distribution, the group delay, and the maximum film thickness of a single-mode waveguide scarcely depends on the shape of the distribution. The maximum value of the film thickness in the single-mode transmission region optimizes the scattering loss and the energy confinement. The scattering loss of a waveguide with a gradual index distribution is smaller than that of a three-layer waveguide when the transverse correlation is small, but it is not much altered when the transverse correlation is large."
"An absolute calibration procedure for periodic microwave phase shifters is described. Increments on the phase shifter are compared by substitution with a reproducible phase-shift step of initially unknown value. The periodic nature of the phase shifter provides a reference phase shift of 360/spl deg/, and alternative methods are outlined for the derivation of the correction curve from the step measurements. It is shown that the accuracy of the calibration is governed by the precision and reproducibility of the phase shifter under test."
"The potential problem associated with a capacitor bounded by concentric rectangles may be solved by conformably mapping a certain L-shaped region onto the upper half plane. In certain cases, the integral, by which the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation may be expressed, can be evaluated in terms of two elliptic integrals of the first kind. Then the odd- and even-mode impedance of the related transmission line is readily found."
"Two waves traveling in opposite directions that are coupled by a random coupling function are considered. These two waves can be described in a standard way by coupled wave equations. It is possible to derive coupled equations for the power carried by these two waves. The form of the coupled power equations differs depending on the assumptions that are made for the initial conditions. The validity of the coupled power equations has been confirmed by a computer-simulated experiment."
"A Fabry-Perot resonator formed by parabolic cylindrical reflecting mirrors and filled with anisotropic medium is analyzed theoretically. For the resonance of the extraordinary wave in such a resonator, optimum shapes of the reflecting mirrors exist, which are derived from the boundary conditions on each mirror."
"A combination of hot air and microwave heating is generally achieved by placing air knives alongside the waveguide applicators when drying web materials. lf the air knife is placed inside the applicator, using it as the center conductor of a TEM structure, better or additional moisture removal may be achieved. The TEM mode also permits more control of the wave attenuation. Perturbation formulas are developed to compare conventional slotted waveguide applicators with two TEM systems. Experimental results are given. Improved uniformity of heating and lower leakage are indicated."
"Feedthroughs are used in latching ferrite phasers having control wires entering the microwave region. The feedthrough damps out the troublesome resonances that occur as a result of air gaps at the ferrite-waveguide wall interface and at the same time chokes out the radiation from the holes through which the latching wires pass. The equations and curves necessary to design the feedthrough are presented, as well as some experimental results obtained at C band on a practical production configuration."
"A computer-aided numerical analysis of the dominant mode propagating in microstrip transmission line is reported, and the theoretical results are corroborated by experimental measurements. A region of almost complete circular polarization is found to exist at the surface of the dielectric, although most of the energy is concentrated directly beneath the strip conductor where the fields possess almost complete linear polarization."
"The design of octave-bandwidth microstrip interdigital dc blocks is presented. Data for a 7.75- to 16.3-GHz design are given and correlated with an approximate equivalent circuit based on even and odd mode propagation in coupled microstrip. Additional data are tabulated reflecting the ability to shift the frequency band of operation."
"The problem of wave propagation on nonuniform transmission lines is studied. Equations are presented not only for the reflection coefficient but for the transmission and admittance properties as well. They are valid under the assumption that only one mode of propagation exists on the line and that the properties do not change so rapidly that the fundamental transmission line equations are no longer applicable. Since all equations are derived for arbitrary load conditions, an extremely versatile solution of the problem has been obtained."
"The field distribution of the mode in a ferrite-filled coaxial cavity, which converges towards the TEM mode in the isotropic case, is discussed."

"A lumped equivalent circuit is used to represent the impedance presented to the device terminals for a waveguide-mounted Gunn oscillator. Analytic expressions are used for all the lumped elements. This circuit model is used to predict tuning curves which are compared to experimental tuning curves obtained for iris coupling, for full- and reduced-height waveguides, and for various post diameters. Iris-controlled nontunable modes are reported and explained by the model. The real part of the load impedance presented at the device terminals is found to agree with Copeland's prediction for optimum loading. Experimentally observed mode switching is explained with reference to variations in device parameters."
"The theoretically known magnitude of the series lumped reactance, as a function of impedance step ratio, resulting from an impedance step discontinuity in symmetric stripline is confirmed, and an alternative expression for the inductance is given. A reduction of this reactance has been achieved by splitting the narrower strip at the impedance step junction into a multistrip configuration, while retaining the total characteristic impedance value. A way of compensating the effect of the reactance on the pass-band characteristics of quarter-wave impedance transformers and filters is developed. This is achieved by the introduction of a lumped series capacitance at the impedance step discontinuity."
"The problem of electromagnetic wave propagation in hollow conducting waveguides of arbitrary cross section is formulated as an integro-differential equation in terms of fields at the waveguide boundary. Cutoff wave numbers and wall currents appear as eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a nonlinear eigenvalue problem involving an integro-differential operator. A variational solution is effected by reducing the problem to matrix form using the method of moments. A specific solution of the problem is developed using triangle expansion functions in the method of moments. The solution is simplified by symmetry considerations and is implemented by two digital computer programs. Listings and full documentation of these programs are available. This solution yields accurate determinations of cutoff wave numbers, wall currents, and distributions of both longitudinal and transverse modal field components for the first several modes. Illustrative computations are presented for the single-ridge waveguide, which has a complicated boundary shape that does not lend itself to exact solution."
"A network analogue method for calculation of the capacitance matrix of certain two-dimensional multiconductor systems is presented. The system is contained in a finite or infinite conducting rectangular boundary. An arbitrary number of parallel dielectric layers can be present, and the conductors consist of an arbitrary number of conducting strips at one or more of the dielectric interfaces. The strips are assumed to have zero thickness."
"Dynamic equations of reflection-type nonlinear power amplifiers in both stable and injection-locked modes are derived for modulated signals. The steady-state response and the transient response of an injection-locked negative-resistance diode ampfitier is evaluated. The response for an FM signal is discussed. Numerical results show that the dynamic behavior as well as the steady-state behavior is affected by nonlinearity of the diode conductance and susceptance."
"A new optimization method called grazer search has been developed. This method is suitable for nonlinear minimax optimization of network and system responses. A linear programming problem using gradient information of one or more highest ripples in the response error function to produce a downhill direction followed by a linear search to find a minimum in that direction is central to the algorithm. Unlike the razor search method due to Bandler and Macdonald, the present method overcomes the problem of discontinuous derivatives characteristic of minimax objectives without using random moves. It can fully exploit the advantages of the adjoint network method of evaluating partial derivatives of the response function with respect to the variable parameters. Sufficient details are given to enable the grazer search method to be readily programmed and used. Although the method is intended for the computer-aided solution of an extremely wide range of design problems, it is largely compared with other methods on microwave network design problems, for which the solutions are known. Its reliability and efficiency on more arbitrary problems, examples of which are also included, is thereby established."
"The occurrence of anomalous loss and its explanation in terms of surface waves is discussed. For this type of explanation to be possible the region of occurrence of the surface wave must at least straddle the region of anomalous loss. It is shown that this is so, particularly for the case when there is a mixed air-ferrite surface layer for which this result is not obvious: as the air content decreases, a ferrite-metal surface wave appears and takes over the function of the layer wave. The means by which these waves are generated, and the determination of their amplitudes, appear to require a new physical principle to be applied. A new type of \"edge condition\" is postulated."
"Experimental tests on a new type of beam waveguide constituted by a series of equispaced dielectric frames are described. Field-pattern and power-loss measurements have been performed on short-circuited sections of the waveguide working at 10 GHz and on the 37-GHz prototype constituted by Teflon square frames. In comparison with the more common iris and lens beam waveguides, it presents advantages concerning diffraction, reflection, and dissipation losses. In addition, it is lightweight and compact. The experimental results confirm these advantages, along with a low sensitivity to assembling and constructive imperfections. Design criteria are suggested as a result of the optimization for the lowest losses obtained through numerical computations performed on the equivalent open resonator."
"A 4-level phase switch using two switching diodes and one circulator is investigated and compared to a switch using two circulators. The results are as follows. 1) If one uses a Iossless combining network for the two diodes, it is impossible to make the losses equal in all four switching states. 2) One can balance the losses by introducing a lossy element into the circuit. The loss of this circuit is given as a function of diode Q"
"A self-oscillating-type tunnel-diode mixer having conversion gain operating at a signal frequency of 600 MHz is demonstrated. By changing the bias, conversion gains up to infinity (oscillations) can be obtained, although gains in excess of 20 dB are typical. Variation of gain with bias is such that the maximum magnitude of the local oscillations corresponds to the minimum conversion gain (a loss of more than 30 dB). No explanation can yet be given for this unexpected phenomenon."
"A broad-band MIC current-controlled variable attenuator that exhibits small phase change versus attenuation has been developed. Design factors that effect phase shift are discussed. Performance at frequencies between 0.5 and 3.0 GHz is shown. Measured values of attenuation are shown to be independent of frequency from 0.5 to 3.0 GHz."
"The exact solutions of the design of stepped-impedance transformers presented until now have been tedious and subject to computational error. We present here an exact synthesis procedure which requires less effort than other exact procedures. In addition, two recurrence formulas are given for determining the characteristic impedances of each section. The coefficients so obtained can be compared to eliminate computational errors."
"The attenuation constant due to dielectric losses in a rectangular waveguide loaded with a dielectric slab in the H-plane is calculated. Results for the dominant LSM/sub 11/ mode are presented graphically."
"A system employing RF substitution techniques for automatic phase and intensity measurement of microwave fields is described. The system uses homodyne detection to generate error signals for servomechanisms which balance the attenuation and phase secondary standards. Accuracy and dynamic range of this method of measurement can be strongly dependent on the method of modulation employed. This paper analyzes errors from this cause and indicates what means are available to minimize them. This method of measurement is less expensive than some alternate techniques, and, at the present stage in the evolution of microwave near field measurements, its errors are less serious than uncertainties introduced by absorber reflections, probe characteristics, and mechanical positioning errors."
"An empirically derived relation is reported which accurately describes the open-end effect in microstrip transmission lines on alumina substrates. This empirical equation was used to describe the edge-correction term in Wheeler's general expression for the characteristic impedance for wide lines. It is shown that with this modification there exists a distinct crossover (w/h /spl ap/ 1) between the narrow- and wide-line approximations."
"The permittivity of thin dielectric films can be measured with good accuracy by employing a method recently reported by the authors, whereby the microwave oscillator frequency is automatically locked to the resonant frequency of the test cavity perturbed by the sample, thus leading to a digital readout of the frequency. However, the method is satisfactory only when the frequency shift caused by the presence of the test sample does not exceed the frequency lock-in bandwidth. By employing a search oscillator, controlled by the second harmonic of the modulation signal provided for the frequency locking, this limitation is removed, thus extending the capability of the method to thicker films and/or larger permittivities."
"Iterative methods applied to eigenvalue equations can lead to anomalous convergence. It is shown that this can occur when some of the eigenvalues are complex and the corresponding eigenvectors satisfy a particular condition. A method of distinguishing between anomalous and effective convergence is indicated."

"The theory of AM and FM noise in oscillators of the negative resistance type is extended to higher modulation frequencies, i.e., to modulation frequencies beyond the bandwidth of the stabilizing cavity. The results are expressed in terms of the input impedance of the stabilizing cavity and are found to agree well with measurements."
"Stability criteria for negative conductance oscillators or amplifiers are derived in terms of the total circuit admittance. A figure of merit for phase locking at small injected powers is derived. The influence of large injected signals is studied. The conclusions drawn from the calculations are in good qualitative agreement with experimental observations on phase-locked IMPATT-diode oscillators."
"Broad-band CW amplification with Gunn diodes in waveguide circuits has been obtained, with power gains typically between 10 and 15 dB and half-power bandwidths of more than 1 GHz. It is found that amplifier performance can be modeled with fair accuracy using a rough characterization for the diode parameters."
"The paper shows that a curved boundary need not be approximated by a small number of finite-element sides, resulting in a coarse polygonal approximation to the shape of the region and consequent inaccuracies, but may be defined as accurately as desired. An algorithm and associated mathematics are presented for locating the stationary point of a functional by the Rayleigh-Ritz method with a two-variable power series as a trial function. As a particular example, the functional employed is one that is made stationary by the solution of Poisson's equation under mixed, Dirichlet, or Neumann boundary conditions. The technique is based on the fact that the three boundary conditions are natural ones. Results are presented for a problem involving curved boundaries under mixed and Neumann conditions and for the capacitance calculations of a pair of noncoaxial cylinders having specified potentials. Comparisons are made with the finite-difference method. It is concluded that the finite-element method is, in nearly all aspects, superior to finite differences--particularly when curved boundary modeling errors are reduced. It is expected that the method described will be equally useful for, and quite simple to adapt to, the solution of the Helmholtz equation in an enclosed region."
"It is shown how to obtain accurate numerical values for waveguide characteristics using the null-field method, which is derived using Waterman's extended boundary condition. Computational results are presented for the sector waveguide (for which the field is known in closed form), the cross section of which possesses a sharp re-entrant corner. It is demonstrated that explicitly satisfying the edge conditions at this corner significantly improves the computational accuracy. In agreement with a previous conjecture it is shown, by example using the sector waveguide, that the straightforward point-matching method sometimes gives completely erroneous fields, even when predicting cutoff wavenumbers with moderate accuracy."
"Coupling coefficient, odd- and even-mode impedances, and the mode phase velocities are calculated for a pair of broadside-coupled strips embedded in a layered dielectric medium and enclosed by a rectangular shield. Large ratios of mode phase velocities can be achieved with this structure leading to novel performance characteristics for familiar coupled-line configurations such as the microwave C section."
"By means of finite difference methods, dispersion curves are obtained for the fundamental and higher order hybrid modes in both single and coupled microstrip. Structures of realistic proportions are investigated by the use of a graded finite difference mesh. Variational methods are used in deriving the finite difference equations. The higher order modes are found to be similar to LSM slab line modes. A spurious nonphysical class of solutions is found to exist in this and similar formulations, the characteristics of which are described."
"A method for determining the frequency-dependent characteristics of both single and coupled lines in shielded microstrip is presented. Numerical results are given for a variety of dielectric configurations and the effects of geometry on the dispersion characteristics are examined in detail. Of particular interest are the characteristics of coupled lines on compensated dielectric structures, i.e., structures that are capable of achieving equal even- and odd-mode phase velocities, and the effects of dispersion on the directivity characteristics of such lines are discussed. In addition, the variation of impedance as a function of frequency, where the impedance is defined as the ratio of the power to the square of the longitudinal current, is presented for representative cases of single and coupled lines."
"A method is presented for evaluating the coupling between two identical resonant cavities coupled by a small aperture in a plane common wall of arbitrary thickness. The coupling is related to the frequencies of the symmetric and asymmetric modes of oscillation of the coupled cavity structure, and a variational technique is used to determine those frequencies. The method is applied to circular and rectangular apertures, and it is shown that the coupling is separable into electric and magnetic terms. The results enable theoretical solutions to be obtained for the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of circular and rectangular apertures in walls of zero thickness, and equivalent polarizabilities to be obtained when the wall thickness is nonzero. Curves of numerical values are given for circular and rectangular apertures. With zero wall thickness, the results obtained are the same as those of Bethe for a circular aperture and give good agreement with Cohn's experimental results for rectangular apertures."
"Design equations and experimental data for a class of bandpass filters having up to two attenuation poles at finite frequencies in the stopband are presented. The new designs are obtained by a relatively simple modification of only the end sections of conventional interdigital and half-wave parallel coupled-line filters. Practical realizability constraints generally limit the design technique to wide-band flters."
"The dielectric-ridge loaded waveguide is analyzed approximately in terms of coupled empty waveguide modes. Using this technique the propagation constant can be easily computed, thus allowing the prediction of the properties of a type of dielectric phase shifter. Experimental evidence is presented which indicates that a two-mode approximation yields reasonable accuracy if the dielectric ridge is on center, is relatively thin compared to the width of the waveguide, and has a low dielectric constant relative to that of free space /spl epsiv//sub 0/."
"A Gunn diode oscillator circuit with predictable performance has been developed based on a concept already shown to be practical with IMPATT diodes. Frequency jumps, multifrequency output, and tuning difficulties are eliminated without sacrificing circuit efficiency. The circuit is quite versatile and well suited for Gunn diode characterizations."
"The accuracy of a commonly used noise-measuring system at microwave frequencies is calculated under actual measuring conditions. Serious deviations are shown to occur, which impose a lower and upper frequency limit on \"double-channel\" AM and FM noise measurements, respectively."
"A note is described to design digital diode-loaded-line phase shifters. A 75/spl deg/ separation between the loading susceptances has been shown to give the same or better performance in VSWR, loss, and phase-shift setting than a 90/spl deg/ separation."
"An improved technique for latching ferrite-phaser construction is described. It is particularly attractive when magnetostrictive ferrites or garnets are employed and for configurations utilizing high-dielectric-constant loading. The technique is capable of yielding phasers with very uniform characteristics, large figures of merit, low loss, and excellent average power capability."

"Using the \"natural prototype\" for elliptic function filters, a design procedure is presented for a class of waveguide bandstop filters, which exhibit equiripple passband and stopband responses. Due to the availability of explicit formulas for element values in the natural prototype elliptic function filter, the design procedure is entirely analytic and does not require numerical synthesis techniques. The resulting physical structure is the familiar uniform guide with iris-coupled series stubs. Unlike the bandstop filters designed from maximally flat or Chebyshev prototypes, the elliptic function design results in stubs that are not exactly three-quarter-wave coupled."
"A new class of microwave filters, hairpin-line and hybrid hairpin-line/half-wave parallel-coupled-line filters, is reported. This class of filters is particularly well suited for microstrip and TEM printed-circuit realizations because grounding of the filter resonators is generally not required. Hairpin-line filters have been divided into two types. The first (Type A) is characterized by having its input and output lines open-circuited at their ends. The Type A filter has been found to yield practical impedance levels for narrow to approximately 25-percent bandwidths. The second (Type B) is characterized by having its input and output lines short-circuited at their ends. However, because of space limitations, details of the Type B filter are not presented in this paper. Theoretical background and design equations for Type A bandpass filters are presented. Experimental data for several stripline filters of 5- and 20-percent bandwidths are given. Experimental results for two microwave-integrated-circuit (MIC) filters are discussed."
"The excess charge density distribution near gaps and steps in microstrip transmission lines is calculated by the solution of singular integral equations. Data are presented for gaps in microstrips of width-to-substrate-thickness ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 and relative dielectric constants ranging from 1.0 to 15.0. For steps in a microstrip line results are given for width-to-thickness ratio of unity, relative dielectric constants of 1.0 and 9.6, while the change of width-to-height ratio is from 0.1 to 10.0. The excess charges are calculated explicitly in relatively short computing times, and the results are believed to be accurate to within a few percent."
"The optimum tapered matching section requires impedance steps at the taper ends, which exclude in most cases its application for synthesizing waveguide tapers. A new \"near\" optimum design is described which avoids the impedance steps and yields tapers only a fractional part longer in taper length (or narrower in bandwidth) than the exactly optimum taper. A table of values of a transcendental function has been calculated to simplify the synthesis. An example compares both types of matching sections."
"With an axially magnetized cylindrical ferrite rod inserted into a rectangular waveguide parallel to the E-field of the dominant (TE/sub 10/) mode, the electromagnetic field amplitudes inside the ferrite rod and the transmission and reflection coefficients are numerically obtained by means of a digital computer and their results are shown in figures. At resonance, the distributions of RF magnetization and electric field have good symmetrical patterns in the cross section of the rod. The experimental results of the transmission and reflection coefficients agree well with the theoretical values."
"A moment method is suggested to solve scattering problems in waveguides. It takes advantage of the localized nature of the evanescent waves to assure the convergence of the solutions. The method chooses the point-matching approach with pulse basis functions so that it may be versatile and can be applied to discontinuities of an arbitrary shape. To illustrate this method, examples are given for open-ended parallel-plane waveguides, both flanged and unflanged, and for waveguides with obstacles of various shapes. Comparisons are made with solutions by other approaches and, whenever possible, with exact solutions. The agreements are good."
"The diffraction field of a wave beam from a circular and a rectangular aperture is obtained in the Fresnel region by using the Huygens-Kirchhoff approximation. The diffraction field in the Fraunhofer region can be obtained simply by replacing a parameter. The diffraction field is then expanded into a series of beam mode functions. From the field distributions and the expansion coefficients, which represent the coupling of the incident beam to the various modes in the diffraction field, the effects of an aperture on the incident beam can be known. With this mode expansion method, the conditions for optimum coupling between fundamental modes are obtained and solved numerically."
"The well-known integral-equation formulation of the microstrip problem is solved by a projective method using trial functions that preserve the essential singularity in charge distribution at the strip edges, Suitable computer programs are presented. This formulation is believed particularly useful in the analysis of strip discontinuities, where details of the charge distribution cannot easily be traded off against speed of computation."
"An analysis of a lossy coupling mechanism is presented. It is found that the reciprocal internal Q factor is augmented by a contribution (1 /2)/spl zeta/(l /Q/sub ex/), where /spl zeta/ depends on the Parameters of the coupling mechanism and Q/sub ex/ is the external Q factor. The theory is applied to analyze the coupling to a superconducting high-Q cavity."
"A microstripline slot antenna is treated experimentally at X-band frequency. First, the input impedances of the slots for various geometries and the radiation patterns for the matched slots are measured. Second, the dependence of input impedances and radiation patterns on the slot-to-reflector spacing is tested. Finally, a two-dimensional X-band Dolph-Chebyshev slot-array antenna is designed and fabricated as an application of this type of slot."
"A simple quasi-static formula for the discontinuity susceptance of a 2:1 E-plane waveguide step with a simultaneous change of media is found using the theory of singular integral equations. An important difference from previous solutions by this method comes from the determination of the constants in the solution."
"The purpose of this short paper is to give an exact theory of quarter-wave coupled circulators with Chebyshev characteristics. The synthesis starts by replacing the lumped-element equivalent shunt resonator of the circulator by a distributed one that has the same susceptance slope parameter as the original circuit. In this way the overall network involves commensurate transmission lines only. The bandwidth over which the assumed form of the equivalent circuit applies is carefully discussed in terms of the two split frequencies of the magnetized junction. Tables for the required circulator parameters and transformer admittances for one and two transformer sections as a function of VSWR and bandwidth are included. The realizable solution for the latter arrangement is severely restricted by the equivalent circuit of the basic junction. Experimental results on an octave-band stripline circulator, with a two-section transformer, are also included."
"In treating the problem of the inductive/capacitive diaphragm in waveguide with the integral equation or the moments method, it is often necessary to compute the matrix elements of the guide dyadic in terms of the aperture eigenmodes of the diaphragm. A transformation of the original series is presented that displays superior convergence properties of the numerical solution."
"Analysis and experiments show the extreme dispersion of magnetostatic delay lines. A suitable parameter to characterize the amount of dispersion present has been found to be the maximum output energy contained in a time interval equal to the input pulse duration. The time occurrence of this maximum value gives a convenient measure of the group delay. The pulse shape and energy content versus delay have been determined both theoreticaly and experimentally for axially magnetized circular rods. The results show that delays beyond two to three times the input pulse duration cannot be obtained with more than 50 percent of the output energy contained within the original pulse duration."

"The validity of the reciprocity relation satisfied by the Green's function for Poisson's equation in a two-dielectric region is briefly discussed."
 "The purpose of this short paper is to construct the dissipation and scattering matrices of lossy junctions in terms of the eigenvalues of the dissipation matrix. This removes the need to rely on inequality relations between the scattering parameters of lossy circulators. The eigenvalues of the dissipation, scattering, and admittance matrices are related. The eigenvalues of the dissipation matrix give the dissipation associated with each possible way of exciting the junction. The ones of the scattering matrix give the reflection coefficients associated with these different excitations. The admittance eigenvalues define in each instance the eigennetworks of the junction. This leads to the definition of the entries of the dissipation matrix in terms of the loaded and unloaded Q-factors of the junction eigennetworks. The scattering matrices of a number of lossy 3-port junctions are also constructed directly in terms of the elements of the eigennetworks."

"Brief biographies are provided for Mr. Andre G. Clavier and Dr. George C. Southworth highlighting their professional achievements. Mr. Clavier played a major role in the first successful demonstration of microwave transmission across the English Channel in 1931. Dr. Southworth was one of the first experimentalists to discover, identify, and apply microwave propagation in hollow metal pipes. In addition to their technical contributions, which covered a span of decades and influenced two generations of microwave people, they were also active in our Professional Society. When the Microwave Theory and Techniques Group was formed in 1952, they were members of the first National Administrative Committee. Mr. Clavier was Vice-Chairman of the first Ad Corn and Chairman of the second. Although Dr. Southworth chose not to be an officer, he was active at the Ad Corn meetings and in discussions and correspondence with other members. They were both instrumental and influential in helping to set the pattern for what many of us like to believe is one of the IEEE's most dynamic groups. Recognizing their contributions as scientific pioneers and as concerned professionals, the National Administrative Committee, in 1959, established the status of Honorary Life Member to both honor contributions and to retain participation of the giants in our technology. Dr. Southworth was unanimously chosen our first Honorary Life Member, in 1959, and Mr. Clavier was chosen a year later."
"A brief review is provided of the 1972 International Microwave Symposium."
 "A K-band high-power and highly stable power source has been developed using a cavity-stabilized IMPATT-diode oscillator followed by a one-stage high-power reflection-type IMPATT-diode amplifier. The power source shows an output power of 0.7 W, a temperature coefficient of 6x10/sup -7/ / /spl deg/C, and an FM noise level of 92-Hz rms/1-kHz BW at 100 kHz from the carrier. To achieve a highly stable oscillation, free from mode jumping, a new hybrid-coupled cavity circuit with a passivating absorber is applied to stabilize the oscillation. The high-power amplifier is designed using a measured large signal device admittance and a power-adding concept."
"The intermodulation products produced when two equal-amplitude signals are applied to the input of an X-band IMPATT-diode amplifier have been measured. An Si p+nn+ IMPATT diode was operated in a double-slug-tuned coaxial reflection amplifier circuit that was tuned to provide 20 dB of small-signal gain at 9.340 GHz. The intermodulation tests consist of measurements of the magnitudes and frequencies of the amplifier output signals as a function of the input-signal drive levels and frequency separations. The gain and single-frequency characteristics of the amplifer were also measured, and are used along with the theoretical device and circuit admittance characteristics as a basis for explanation of the intermodulation results. A low-frequency dominance mechanism is found to exist in which the low-frequency signals are amplifed more than the high-frequency signals. This mechanism becomes more significant as the amplifier drive level is increased."
"The design and experimental performance of a wide-band K-band parametric amplifier (paramp) for the experimental domestic satellite communication earth station are described. An optimum idler frequency for a minimum noise temperature is derived taking into account the varactor diode skin effect. Wide-band paramps with a double-tuned signal circuit are discussed and it is shown that triple-tuned gain characteristics are realizable with this configuration. Finally, an 18-GHz paramp is described, which can be operated from room- to liquid-helium (LHe) temperature, only requiring adjustment of pumping power and bias voltage and using lithium ferrite circulators. Triple-tuned gain characteristics with a bandwidth of 1300 MHz at a gain of 10 dB are obtained using a miniature pill prong packaged varactor."
"The design of millimeter-wave filters is, in principle, no different from the design of conventional waveguide filters. In practice, however, several factors impose limitations on the choice of the filter structure. As a result, new filter structures must be used requiring new synthesis techniques for their design. In this paper, a new channel diplexer structure is described and a synthesis technique for its design is given. The expected electrical performance of the filter, designed using the proposed technique, is verified by measuring the performance of a scaled filter model centered at 3.95 GHz. The results of these measurements are given. The design procedure is also applicable to other waveguide filter structures."
"Experimental results of the 4-port nonreciprocal band-stop-pass filter and the tunable resonance type circulator with the properties of the 4-port filter are reported, and the theory of the new nonreciprocal circuit is discussed. The filter operates over a two-octave frequency range and the over about a one-octave frequency range."
"A new and practical approach to computer-aided design optimization is presented. Central to the process is the application of least pth approximation using extremely large values of p, typically 1000 to 1 000 000. It is shown how suitable and reasonably well conditioned objective functions can be formulated, giving particular emphasis to more general approximation problems as, for example, in filter design. It is demonstrated how easily and efficiently extremely near minimax results can be achieved on a discrete set of sample points. Highly efficient gradient methods can be employed and, in network design problems, the use of the adjoint network approach for evaluating gradients results in greater savings in computer effort. A comparison between the Fletcher-Powell method and the more recent Fletcher method is made on the application of least pth approximation, using a range of values of p up to 1 000 000 000 000 on transmission-line transformer problems for which optimal minimax solutions are known. This is followed by filter design examples subject to certain constraints."
"An unbounded region is divided into local picture-frame regions where a partial differential-equation solution is obtained, with the remaining unbounded region represented by an integral equation. (The method permits the use of free-space Green's functions, and thus special problem-dependent Green's functions need not be found.) The integral equation is formulated as a constraint upon the local picture-frame solutions, whence these local solutions are solved directly by a variational method, using finite elements, in a manner such that the problem of the Green's-function singularity is side-stepped. The technique is applicable where sources and media inhomogeneities and anisotropies are local, and can all be placed within one or several picture frames. It is in these cases that the integral-equation approach is at a particular disadvantage, and the use of a partial differential-equation technique is advisable if not necessary. Examples presented include the static and harmonic fields of a parallel-plate capacitor, a microstrip line on a dielectric substratum, and a radiating antenna with dielectric obstacles."
"This short paper describes a method for computing the edge capacitance of finite or semi-infinite sections of microstrip transmission lines. The approach is based on Galerkin's method applied in the Fourier-transform domain. It is mathematically simple and requires the inversion of rather small-size matrices."
"It is shown that, if expansion terms of all the modes appearing in the Green's function for the problem are retained, the singular integral equation method can be made to apply by generating a differential equation for this integral. The solution of the differential equation is straightforward, and the inversion of the resulting integral equation then follows standard methods. The process is applied in detail to the case of the capacitive diaphragm, and the results compared to the quasi-static method with correction terms. The results are close for small guide widths, but the present method should give superior results if the guide width permits some overmoding."

 "Historically, control functions for \"make \"and \"test\" operations in discrete manufacturing processes have been satisfied with special purpose hardware. In recent years, computers have replaced much of this special purpose hardware. The initial reasons for employing computers were to decrease capital and development costs while providing greater flexibility in responding to process changes. It now appears that the greatest benefits of applying computers in discrete manufacturing processes are the increased process yields and decreased rework through the use of Process"

"The Staggered Moving Average Technique (SMA T) is an algorithm that enables component manufacturing to forecast or generate a one-year manufacturing plan. SMAT minimizes the impact of step function schedule changes on equipment, product and manpower requirements by smoothing production rates. At the same time, it takes into account changes in inventory levels associated with the production requirements. The benefits of SMA T include a coordinated output of schedules, equipment requirements, production rates and inventory levels on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis."
   "Contact resistance has been used to characterize the processes of physical contact in metallic systems with ultra clean surfaces. The contact resistance versus load curves of iron and two cobalt alloys were used to demonstrate the existence of surface work hardening and interfacial creep during contact as well as the fracture characteristics of an interfacial junction as the load is removed. The presence of an adsorbed film of hydrogen or hydrogen ions on iron completely changes the contact process. A comparison of the contact resistance versus load data for ultra pure iron, an iron-cobalt alloy and a cobalt molybdenum-chromium was used to illustrate the effect of substrate mechanical properties on static adhesion and the ability to convert these data for the estimation of the dynamic coefficient of friction under the particular experimental conditions."
"The manner in which the various surfaces interact during wire wrapping, and the structure at the contact sites in the completed joint, have received only cursory attention. This paper describes an investigation designed to elucidate these phenomena using metallographic, scanning electron microscopic and electron microprobe analysis techniques. Series of joints made under known sets of parameters are examined to provide data on post-into-wire penetration, metal displacement and contact area :for different wrapping loads. It is shown that at high wrapping loads, the wrapping system tends towards an unstable state analogous to the onset of necking in tensile strain. Scanning electron microscopy and microprobe analysis of the surfaces of dismantled joints are used to show irrefutably that a substantial amount of cold welding occurs during the wrapping sequence. The transfer of metal from wire to post, and vice versa, by a welding-followed-by-fracture mechanism is clearly demonstrated for a variety of materials. This contradicts currently held views on the subject and indicates additional guide-lines for wrapped joint design. Above all, it is evident that the presence, and subsequent behaviour during wrapping, of thin plated layers on wire and terminal post cannot be ignored, and indeed plays a significant role in joint formation. A theoretical model is used to derive variation in contact area with wire diameter for typical joints. A change in wire diameter from 0.050 cm to a micro-wrap dimension of 0.017 cm is seen to reduce the area of individual contact sites by an order of magnitude, i.e. to approximately l0-4 cm2. It is argued that as the contact areas of wrapped joints tend towards this microscopic level, the phenomena discussed under the heading of \"micro--mechanisms of wrapped joint formation\" assume great significance."
  "A theory of electrode controlled arc expansion is developed in terms of the finite time it takes for the current path in the electrodes, to change from the highly constricted state during the molten bridge stage, to the less constricted state of the fully developed arc. This theory gives satisfactory agreement for vacuum arc expansion rates when freshly prepared electrodes are used. The expansion rates for the arc after the electrodes have been arced once, however, are much slower. By considering small changes in the work function of the surfaces of the cathode we give a qualitative explanation of this slower expansion."
"Ultrasonic techniques are being increasingly used for nondestructive testing and quality control of bonds between the electrical contacts and the support members of the contact assemblies. The state-of-the-art of this valuable tool is analysed and discussed from a control standpoint. Two ultrasonic techniques, namely, the delayed pulse echo and the through-transmission, are described and discussed with respect to their limitations and merits for the brazed bond quality between the silver-cadmium oxide or silver contact and the copper support. The Instrument calibration technique, the range of test frequencies and the resolution of the voids are determined, for various thicknesses of the contact and the support material. The instrumentation and data including C-scan chart recording of the voids for discrete components as well as for continuous bonding of strip materials are presented and discussed."
"This paper presents a detailed description of the effect of single additive elements selected from Group IA and Group IIA of the Periodic Table on the microstructure and other physical and electrical properties of Ag-10 CdO contact materials produced by internal oxidation of silvercadmium alloys. The additive elements studied in this investigation were lithium, beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium, in amounts from 0.01 w/o to 1.0 w/o. Hardness and electrical conductivity were measured, along with 20,000 cycle make and break contact testing. It was observed that very small amounts of certain additives In these groups can influence the morphology and properties of silver-cadmium oxide contact materials, generally resulting in a refinement of the size of the dispersed particles. The generally accepted assumption that reduction in dispersed particle size always results in lower erosion rates during contact use was shown not always to be true. In concentrations to . 1 w/o, the additives were shown to minimize or eliminate grain boundary precipitation or form divorced grain boundaries. Additive concentrations greater than 0.50 w/o in certain cases can produce heavy grain boundary precipitation and may prevent the normal propagation of the oxidation front. Precipitation of the oxide can occur in a periodic manner, apparently of the Leisegang type, when additions of up to 0.3 w/o magnesium or less than 0.15 w/o beryllium is used. The influence of each additive on the hardness and conductivity of the basic composite is also reported along with the microstructural features and electrical contact performance."
  "Forced convection cooling with direct air impingement on modules mounting LSI hybrid packs is analyzed with one comprehensive thermal mode. A matrix solution for a steady state nodal conductance network is used to predict the temperature rise of the coolant flowing over the module and substrate-to-inlet air temperature differentials. To allow the utilization of a fine nodal mesh to model a hybrid substrate and yet limit the nodal network to a matrix size which can be inexpensively solved by computer, a method is presented to simulate hybrid substrates using equivalent conductances. The problem of determining the forced convection heat transfer coefficient in a module cooling channel where the hermetically sealed hybrid substrates act as protuberances is addressed. Analytical prediction ,of substrate-to-inlet air temperature differences obtained from the thermal model is favorably compared with experimental measurements."
  "The potential of sputtered Ta-50 at. % Al alloy films for tantalum integrated circuit resistor applications was evaluated. Test resistors covering a range of 25 to 1000\\Omega/o were fabricated from 900 to 1500\\AAthick alloy films (on ceramic substrates) using two different anodic thinning-stabilization heat treatment process sequences. The effect of initial thickness and process sequence on stability was determined by accelerated aging, thermally at 250 and 15O°C, and under DC power at 2 watts (6.2 watts/cm2). It was found that the Ta-50 at. % Al alloys offer outstanding potential for circuit and R-C network applications requiring highly stable 25 to 1000\\Omega/o film resistors. For such applications, the alloys exhibit a combination of attractive characteristics which include: 1) the ability to readily adjust the sheet resistance by anodization; 2) the maintenance of a relatively constant temperature coefficient of resistance; 3) excellent stability during both thermal and power aging tests."

A comparison of the thermal impedance of the 2N2222 and 2N3725 and the beam-lead equivalents of these devices is made. The beam-lead B2T2222 is used as a test vehicle to evaluate the effect of chip area, beam design, substrate temperature, and conformal coatings on the thermal impedance of beam-lead chips. Thermal impedance data for use in designing hybrid circuits with beam-lead devices are included."
 "This study explores the major factors which may affect the stability of thin film nickel-chromium resistors. These factors include annealing temperatures, manufacturing processes, form factors, power density, and trimming. The results of a 1000-hour load life study are given in terms of these same major factors."
 "An ac sputtering technique is described which utilizes an array of tubular target electrodes. Reduced substrate heating is achieved by a combination of efficient cooling of the target electrodes and the unique geometry of the target array. Because substrate heating is reduced, capacitor grade beta-tantalum films have been deposited at 450 Å/min; a two-fold increase over maximum deposition rates for such films in a conventional dc sputtering process. Alloy films can be conveniently deposited with this ac sputtering method. The alloy composition is selected and controlled by electrical means. This concept has bean successfully applied to the deposition of tantalum-aluminum alloy films."
"In order to experimentally evaluate the thermal effects of changes in integrated circuit (lC) packaging, a thermal chip was designed and tested. The thermal chip replaces a working chip in an lC package. It provides a method for measurement of temperatures on a chip where the heat input simulates that of a working chip. Temperature distribution can be obtained by making measurements at 16 locations on the chip. It further provides simulation of the distribution of heat input on a working chip by providing 16 locations for individually controlled heat input. (In fact, there are 32 transistors, grouped in 16 closely spaced pairs, each of which can be powered individually to act as either a \"thermometer\" or as a heat source thereby giving flexibility to match a working power array). An important feature of this design is the ability to obtain a chip temperature distribution when the chip is encapsulated or mounted facedown. Chip-to-substrata thermal resistances for filled and unfilled epoxy bonding materials were measured. Chip-to-coolant thermal resistances for face-mounted and beck-mounted multibond chips (with beam-type leads) are included. The thermal chip was found to be an effective tool for measuring the temperature distribution on a chip under different power, packaging, and cooling configurations."
 "Carbon dioxide lasers arc widely used to separate alumina sheet into individual substrates for hybrid microcircuits. Laser separation offers several advantages over other conventional techniques; however, the effects on the flexural strength of the alumina have not previously been investigated. The flexural strength of alumina substratas separated by CO2, Q-switched YAG, and pulsed YAG lasers and diamond sewing are compared. The Q-switched YAG laser technique produced substrates 45 percent stronger than the CO2and pulsed YAG laser techniques, and 13 percent stronger than the diamond saw method."
"Thin films of barium titanate in the range of 0.2 to 1.25 microns were successfully grown by RF sputtering on doped silicon substrates with resistivities of 0.002\\Omeg\\bulletcm to 0.25\\Omeg\\bulletcm . Two types of film crystal structures were achieved: 1)mixed orientation growth; and 2) preferred orientation growth along the < 100 > axis. The film stoichiometry was very much dependent on film structure during deposition. The effective crystallite size and nonuniform strain were also found to depend on the initial growth conditions. The electrical properties of these films were strongly influenced by the initial growth conditions and physical structure. The following are some of the important electrical properties: relative dielectric constant-110 to 215; loss factor-l.8 to 5.0 percent; electrical resistivity-lO10to 1013\\Omeg\\bulletcm; and dielectric breakdown->lO5V/cm."
 "To obtain consistent and reliable beam lead device attachment by thermocompression bonding, it is necessary to determine an allowable range of bonding parameters over which the mechanical integrity of the device attachment is optimized. This paper discusses the practical considerations of beam lead wobble tool bonding, and describes the theoretical and experimental techniques which were used to establish the critical bonding variables. Using these techniques a bond schedule has been developed in terms of only two variables, bond force and interface temperature."
"Primary explosive systems, as described, are now being used as a safe and predictable energy source to bond metals on a size scale comparable to microcircuit electrical interconnections. Basic primary explosive reaction characteristics have been analyzed and related to effective bond mechanisms for solid-phase explosive bonding of several metal combinations. Methods and materials systems were devised to accurately deposit a specific quantity and configuration of explosive with predetermined reaction characteristics. This has permitted a significant advance in use of explosive bonding on a microscale. The theoretical explosive bonding mechanism is supported by experimental data. Included in considerations are surface jetting characteristics which influence interface structures and are responsible for removing surface oxides and contaminants. A large variety of similar and dissimilar metal pairs was joined reliably and repeatedly with bond strengths greater than those of the parent metals. Explceive bonding advantages and disadvantages considering materials and bonding equipment requirements are cited."
 "The electrical current through silver contacts evaporated onto n-type gallium arsenide as a function of surface treatment is reported. Contacts to untreated gallium arsenide exhibit the expected high resistance. Surface cleaning by argon ion bombardment reduces the resistance by three orders of magnitude. The electrical resistance beyond 850 eV increases rapidly with ion bombardment energy. The resistance minimum at 850 eV is explained semiquantitatively in terms of a balance between cleaning and surface damage. This type of contact is appropriate for addition to a finished material whose properties are to be investigated, but may not be adequately ohmic for use on production devices."
 "A miniaturized delay line wound on a sectionalized plastic spool is described. The surfaces of the spool and flange separators are coated with a silver paint which serves as a capacitor electrode. The other capacitor electrode is a winding conductor and the capacitance is derived from the wire insulation. To raise the capacitance the spaces between turns of the windings and between the windings and the flange or-core are filled with an oil having a dielectric constant somewhat greeter than air. The surface electrical resistance of a silver paint electrode has a significant effect on the output voltage loss and the capacitance of the delay line. In general, the thinner silver paint electrodes result in less output voltage loss and also lower capacitance. In view of the output voltage and the delay time of this delay line, suitable surface electrical resistance is 15 to 25/Omeg/square, hence the effect of thickness of silver paint electrodes is discussed. The temperature coefficient of delay time is improved by using a filler oil with a negative temperature coefficient of dielectric constant. A further improvement is achieved by a newly developed packing method. The miniaturized delay line in a size of 11x14x45mm has a low output loss of 3 dB at 4 MHz."
"We investigated the effect of a reduction of the protective gas pressure at fixed static breakdown Voltage on the appearance of showering (intermittent arcing) in dry reed contacts that break inductive circuits by using a discharge gap arid an auxiliary interruptor to simulate this condition. We found a critical pressure range, where showering, capable of causing strong erosion, is replaced by glow discharges. In the case of actually operating contacts, it was only possible to reduce showering for forty percent of the total openings by lowering the gas pressure. These results can be explained by suggesting that in the case of the discharge gap that represents a relay opening contact having large contact spacing, the showering arcs, developed from the preceding glow discharges, can be minimized by reducing the gas pressure in such a way that arc formation is inhibited. In the case of the operating contact, other mechanisms exist, such as high electrical fields and high temperature spots. These mechanisms are not affected much by reducing the gas pressure; thus showering is only partially prevented."
 "The purpose of this paper is to give the nonspecialist some tools he can use to gain insight into some of the complex thermal problems encountered in electronic assemblies. Some causes of thermal problems in electronic components and assemblies are briefly reviewed on a fundamental level. This review includes a discussion of some basic thermal parameters, the effect of the thermal environment on other physical parameters, and ways the thermal environment affects the operating characteristics and life of electronic assemblies. Most of the paper is devoted to specific thermal design and cooling problems. Techniques are presented which can be used to determine the thermal stresses that develop in some assemblies during soldering, shipping, and storage; and to determine the cyclic thermal stresses that develop during normal operation. In addition, some fundamentals of heat transfer from minute electronic components by conduction, convection, and radiation are reviewed, and techniques are described that can be used to predict the heat transfer from both single and multiple sources. Experimental and analytical studies are cited to illustrate each topic discussed. For example, experimental data are presented to show the effect temperature has on the coefficient of thermal expansion and the compliance of epoxy-glass composites and its effect on stress relaxation in solder, These data are then used to analyze the form of the stresses that exist in a plated-through hole during soldering and temperature cycling."
"General properties of electronic ceramics are examined, noting especially their influence upon fabrication economics and quality. Particular emphasis is placed upon the preparation of sinterable powders to attain high densification. The effects of fabrication technique and powder preparation upon ceramic quality and dimensional control are pointed out. Recent developments and possible future trends in electronic ceramic materials are discussed briefly."
"The principles governing the operation and performance of devices utilizing mesomorphic anisotropic fluids (liquid crystals) am reviewed and systematized according to materials, dielectric type, and mode of operation. A further breakdown is made into whether the phenomenon is a change in optical density (color), diffraction, or scattering. Some of the possible directions for optical applications are indicated for which liquid crystals may be unique. Performance, life, circuit parameters, and drive characteristics are considered."
"A comparison has been made of high strength filament materials having low dielectric and loss-tangent properties for use in antennae cables; lines and guys. The availability of type S glass fibers of higher strength than type E and the more recent production of high-modulus carbon filaments, and high-modulus organic type polymeric fibers offer several materials to choose from for optimum design. Since frequently both the mechanical and electrical properties are important for cables, a brief review is given of properties considered for final design and production. A specific problem and solution is analyzed with supporting data. At the Cornell University National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center in Puerto Rico, cables used in the antennas ,system had to meet the following unique combination of requirements: 1) high modulus for a low total elongation, 2) assurance of rigidity at comparatively low prestrain loads, and 3) low loss-tangent and dielectric properties. The final lines involved use of a recently developed PRD-49 organic fiber exhibiting higher polymer strength and modulus than previously obtainable. A modulus of 16.5x106psi was obtained for a line capable of supporting a 19, 000 Ib load and weighing approximately 0.04 Ib/ft of length. The implications of this work in other antennae and related design problems are also discussed."
"Industry specialists do most of the fabrication of glass-sealed headers for suppliers of hermetic electronic components. Too often, these specialists are not acquainted with the effect that header processing can have on component fabrication, assembly or use. Almost as frequently, the component maker is unable to relate his own processing difficulties to problems introduced during the previous handling of subassemblies. This paper presents an analysis of the effect that the oxidation of leads prior to glass sealing has on component assembly and use. Metallographic techniques are useful for the control of affected component parts. Some examples of the use of metallography for the evaluation of glass-metal seals are shown."

"The introduction of a dyadic Green's function by means of which the vector wave equation, satisfied by the electric vector or the magnetic vector, can be integrated presents the most elegant and efficient way of dealing with many electromagnetic problems with sources. This text by C.T.Tai, well known for his research and teaching in Electromagnetic Theory, is a very thorough and lucid treatment of this topic. Intended for senior and graduate students in electrical engineering, applied mathematics and applied physics, it provides the basic concepts and properties of dyadic Green's functions as well as important applications of these functions in solving many sophisticated and useful problems in Electrmagnetics. It is also an indispensible primer for any researchers in the antenna and microwave area. "

"The author supposes that there is no question but that our journal, the G-AP Transactions, is the Group's most important reason for being. As you should know also, it has become impossible for an IEEE Group to publish an appreciable number of pages per year without receiving a significant part of their income from payments for page charges. A good reminder for those who might,forget or ignore these facts is printed on the inside back cover of each issue of the G-AP Transactions under the title given above. The message is of such importance that I am repeating it here for those who do not read that far into our journal."

"Summary form only given, as follows. The G-AP Editor comments on only one item in the above-named letter [ibid, vol 14, no 4, Dec 1972, page 9], namely No. 3, where Mr. Ricardi suggests that we might require authors of political letters to have, say, 100 members co-sign or condone the letter. He would not consider this to be very practical and he seriously doubts if it would ever be necessary. As editor of the G-AP newsletter, he has repeatedly asked for letters or comments from the members. I is now editing his fourth issue and the letters received so far have been very, very few. He Sincerely welcome others. Even though they are political, if they are pertinent and of general interest to G-AP members, he would want to publish them."
"This book discusses mainly the application of the Wiener-Hopf technique to the solution of a class of electromapnetic boundary value problems associated with rectangular waves. Chapter I presents sone hackground material. Chanter II deals with the standard mode-mathcing matchinp technique used for formulating boundary value problem in guided wave theory. Chapter 111 gives a comprehensive discussion of the Wiener-Hopf techniaue and its applications for various boundary value problemns. Chapters IV and V discusses the generalization of mode-matchinp and Wiener-Hopf techniques so that the ranges of applications may be broadened. The book draws heavily on the research performed by the authros and their associates at the University of Illinois. The most significant aspect of the book is Weinstein's work on radiation and diffraction from the open end of a waveguide. It is a well written book on the application of the Wiener-Hopf technique to rectangular waveguide communications."

"Using the iterative sampling method, sidelobe peaks can be made to conform to a specified shape within a given tolerance. The iterative sampling method allows the specifications for a given problem to be just satisfied, thereby avoiding an overdesigned pattern which may have a complicated current distribution or wide main beam. The type of calculations involved are typically only summations of series of elementary functions and, consequently, the method is easy to apply to both large and small antennas. Several computer examples are presented, all of which have low ratios of maximum to minimum current amplitudes and low super directive ratios."
"The radiation properties of a double parasitic loop counterpoise antenna capable of bringing out superior performance from the existing VHF omnirange (VOR) systems are discussed. It is shown that such an antenna when suitably designed will reduce considerably the siting errors inherent in the existing VOR systems."
"Scatter from the sea near grazing from MF through VHF is analyzed in this paper. Results based on the compensation theorem show that the dependence upon the grazing angles, as well as upon frequency, range, and the effective surface impedance, can be removed for vertical polarization as the familiar \"Norton attenuation factors.\" Time variation of the surface is included, and results are derived for both the average received power and its spectral density. The first-order dispersion relationship for gravity waves is used to show that the received spectrum from a patch of sea consists of two discrete Doppler shifts above and below the carrier, predictable from simple Bragg diffraction considerations. Using the Phillips wind-wave model as an upper limit for wave heights, estimates for\\sigma^{0}(radar cross section per unit area) of - 17 dB are obtained near grazing. Both the magnitude of\\sigma_{\\upsilon\\nu}^{0}predicted from theory and the nature of the received spectrum are compared with measurements, and the agreement supports the theory on both counts. Finally, the use of MF/HF radars for measuring sea state is suggested and discussed."
"Integral representations are given for the radiation field from slots on the surface of a semi-infinite conducting cone. The corresponding normal mode representations for delta function circumferential slots are evaluated numerically for various cone angles, slot positions, and azimuthal variations. Experimentally measured patterns for two finite models are reported and compared with the semi-infinite cone theory. In particular, effects due to finite cone length and finite tip radius are discussed."
"First-order diffraction coefficients for a slot-excited conical antenna are calculated, beginning with integral expressions for the radiation field. Simple formulas based on these coefficients are presented for the radiation patterns that correctly reproduce the interference structure as well as predict the magnitude of the field down to quite low frequencies. Plots of the diffraction coefficients are given for both symmetric and asymmetric excitation of a circumferential slot. Radiation fields are compared with those obtained by summing the exact normal mode series."
"A perturbation technique has been utilized to obtain the scattering of electromagnetic waves by an underdense plasma layer for Gaussian, sech2, and parabolic density distribution, and the calculations compared with accurate solutions. The results for the reflection are good at small values of plasma width, but (except for the parabolic case) decrease too rapidly at large plasma widths. The transmission coefficient is more difficult to calculate and, despite the presence of absorption, has a spurious rise to unity at large plasma widths. A Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin calculation of the transmission yields fairly accurate results and with less labor than required by the perturbation method."
"Electrically short folded monopole antennas with lumped mutual coupling between driven and folded sections are considered, showing that the input radiative impedance exhibits a resonance frequency depending upon the sign and magnitude of the coefficient of coupling. If extended to \"n-folded\" monopoles with separate lumped mutual couplings, the analysis shows the input radiative impedance will exhibitnstaggered resonance frequencies and bandwidth broadening."
"The admittance of a half-wavelength slot antenna in a two-layer lossy plasma is shown to be greatly affected by moderate electron temperatures (T_{e} \\leq 1 eV) when the plasma is overdense. The effects of slot width and electron collision frequency upon the slot admittance also are investigated."
"Diffraction of an electromagnetic plane wave by an infinite slit in a screen with surface impedance is solved analytically as a boundary value problem under the assumption that the plane of incidence is normal to the slit in a screen of zero thickness surrounded by a homogeneous medium. The field expressions and the transmission coefficient are derived asymptotically, and their numerical solutions are presented for a special case of perfect conducting screen."
"A generalized analysis of electromagnetic (EM) wave scattering from rough surfaces yields an expression for mean scattered power flux which is the spatial Fourier transform of the product of three transfer functions: 1) the optical transfer function (OTF) of the propagating medium; 2) the joint characteristic function of the surface roughness; and 3) a coherence involving the mean surface and the wave profile. The solution is applicable to moderately rough surfaces which have rms slopes less than a few degrees. The solution is applied to laser scattering from aluminum and titanium surfaces where the medium is the atmosphere. The randomly rough surface consists of independent \"roughness\" and \"waviness\" components which possess a Gaussian autocorrelation. The deterministic surface is quadratic; the laser profile, Gaussian. The atmospheric OTF is modeled into a Gaussian form. For typical parameters, the result decouples into a specular term (depending on turbulence, wave profile, and known surface) and a diffuse component (depending on rough and known surfaces). A slightly spherical incident wave affects only the coherent term."
"An analytical approach to the design of a super-synthesis antenna array is applied in this paper. It involves isolation and separate optimization of the influence of different parameters on the sampling of the spatial frequency components. The approach requires a detailed understanding of the geometry of tracking by an ensemble of baselines, but it gives a nearly optimum array design without much help from a computer. A feature of this design is that by simply doubling the array elements, the synthesized main beam area of the array is reduced 16 fold. Extensive computations have been used to demonstrate this extraordinary result."
"The feasibility of correcting phase aberrations of spherical reflector antennas with planar array feeds has been investigated. This type of feed seems to be particularly attractive for applications requiring several closely spaced beams. A synthesis procedure for the array excitation has been developed which minimizes the mean-square error with respect to a prescribed reflector illumination. This method was applied to the analysis of a spherical reflector antenna with a642\\lambdadiameter and an effectiveFnumber of 0.9."
"General formulations for temporal frequency spectra of the fluctuations of plane, spherical, and beam waves operating at two frequencies are given based on weak turbulence and frozen-in assumptions. The cross spectra and the coherence are obtained for the amplitude at two frequencies, the phase at two frequencies, and the amplitude at one frequency and the phase at another frequency. The results are examined in detail for plane and spherical waves. For the spectrum of the index of refraction\\kappa^{-n}in the inertial subrange, the amplitude spectrum behaves ask^{(5-n)/2}for\\omega \\rightarrow 0andk^{2}\\omega^{1-n}for\\omega \\rightarrow \\infty. The phase spectrum for\\omega\\rightarrow 0and for\\omega\\rightarrow\\inftybehaves ask^{2}\\omega^{1-n}with different constants. These results agree well with the experimental work of Janes et al. [11] at 9.6 and 34.5 GHz, and explains the ratio of the spectra at two frequencies. Also noted is the experimental slope of -2.6 as and for\\omega \\rightarrow \\inftywhich may be compared with1-n = -2.66using the Kolmogorov spectrum ofn = 11/3. The amplitude and phase coherence are calculated, and the results agree well with the experimental data. This agreement is indicative of the general validity of the theory for frequencies as low as10\\sim30GHz and the path length as long as 60 km. It is also shown that using the preceding theory, the wind velocity and the structure constantC_{n}can be deduced from the experimental data. Theoretical wind velocity of 15.6 knots obtained from the propagation data compares favorably with the meteorologically measured value of 14 knots, and two values ofC_{n}obtained independently from the amplitude and phase measurements closely agree with each other."
"A highly directive antenna of simple and lightweight structure is designed and tested experimentally. It consists of a dielectric rod with conical hole loading an open-ended circular waveguide. The test has shown that three different radiation patterns can be obtained depending on the depth of penetration of the rod inside the waveguide. Also an improvement on the axial gain can be obtained when the flare angles are smaller than30\\deg. The optimum design consists of a rod of conical flare angle of7.5\\degwhich results in an improvement of 5 dB over the unloaded waveguide accompanied with a beamwidth which is half that of the unloaded structure. One practical application of the proposed design is its use as a feeder for parabolic reflectors, the advantage being the sharp nulls on both sides of the main lobe which will result in minimizing edge diffraction."
"The derivation of an expression for the change in free space input impedance of a finite horizontal dipole, due to the proximity of a conducting half space, is outlined. The impedance change is expressed in a conveniently computable form in terms of the Fourier transform of the antenna current distribution. Using available transforms some typical results are shown over a 50:1 frequency range."
"The effect of symmetrically loading a horn aperture withE-plane dielectric slabs is examined both theoretically and experimentally. It is shown that aperture efficiencies of the order of 92-96 percent may be obtained easily and inexpensively. The technique, which was demonstrated experimentally for a small horn aperture, might find application in limited scan arrays."
"The complex reflection coefficient of a longE-plane sectoral horn is derived using the geometrical theory of diffraction. Single diffraction alone is shown to be sufficient to describe the contribution from theE(widely separated) edges, while singly and doubly diffracted fields from theHedges are included by using an open waveguide result derived elsewhere. A relatively uncomplicated expression is obtained for the complex reflection coefficient of the horn which agrees well with experiment for horns with slant wall lengths greater than about3\\frac{1}{2}guide wavelengths."
"As a result of a 10-month study by the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences, four UHF antennas were designed and fabricated, and their absolute power gains for elevation angles from1\\degto45\\degand azimuthal patterns at5\\degelevation angle were measured with each antenna buried beneath 1 m of refractory concrete. Relative response of the four antennas, placed in solid granite, to a signal transmitted from an aircraft at ranges up to 300 km were recorded. The performance of the best buried antenna was comparable to that of a\\lambda/4monopole fed against a1\\lambdadiameter ground plane resting on the ground surface near the buried antenna."
"Some properties of the electromagnetic field are determined for an unbounded medium characterized by a permittivity tensor whose elements can be expressed as the sum of two terms, one deterministic and the other random. The deterministic and random parts of the permittivity tensor are considered to be uniaxial anisotropic; thus it is a diagonal tensor where two of the three elments are equal. Starting from the bilocal approximation to Dyson's equation, an effective permittivity tensor and mean dyadic Green's function are obtained for small-scale fluctuations. Some important properties of the ordinary and extraordinary waves are also made known."
 "An extensive set of curves for the aperture admittance of a waveguide-fed axial slot on a coated metal cylinder is presented for both an underdense plasma and a Teflon coating. Examination of these curves shows that a slot on a cylinder with aKaof 2 to 3 has about the same aperture admittance as the identical slot opening onto a flat ground plane."
"Radar cross section (RCS) patterns of a thin straight wire have been computed, and the results have been plotted as constant RCS contours on the frequency-aspect plane for a twenty-to-one frequency range. The resulting map illustrates how the resonant peaks and interference nulls vary simultaneously with frequency and aspect, providing a clear picture of the backscattering behavior and allowing reasonable extrapolation to frequencies considerably higher than those actually calculated."
"A numerical basis transformation technique is described which may be applied, in conjunction with point-matching methods (e.g., piecewise uniform or piecewise linear methods), to obtain least-square solutions of electromagnetic scattering by thin wires. It is shown that reductions in both computer solution time and computer storage requirements result. The technique is demonstrated by applying it along with piecewise uniform methods to the solution of scattering by circular loops and straight wires."
"An array antenna containing three arrays of interlaced radiating elements with operating frequencies inL, S, andCbands are described. Measured results include radiation patterns, crosspolarization data, gain, impedance, and mutual coupling measurements. The interlacing of elements of different arrays into a single aperture is shown to be feasible. Mutual interaction between arrays can be significant, but can be reduced by cross polarization between arrays."
"Directivity of rectangular planar arrays is often approximated using the directivity of two constituent linear arrays, either of dipoles or isotropic elements. A result has been derived for directivity of a rectangular planar array of short dipoles (in the plane of the array) using a method from Forman. The severe approximate directivity calculations are compared with this more accurate result. Curves of exact directivity of square arrays of from 4 to 20 elements on a side using short dipoles are presented."
"The superior nature of the Franz formula as compared to that of Stratton and Chu is pointed out. A connection between the two distinct formulas is shown. The compactness of the dyadic version of Franz' formula is emphasized."
"A localized source radiating in anisotropic environment with directionally dependent attenuation produces a beam. The direction and width of this beam are calculated asymptotically."
"It is common to specify a large (in dB) null depth of the difference pattern of monopulse radars. This communication shows that this is not necessary from the points of view of angular precision and accuracy."
"A modified small array technique for measuring both amplitude and phase of the active reflection coefficient is described. The method which does away with corporate feeding and phase shifters utilizes space feeding and employs a slotted line in the central element. Measurements on an 11 by 11 element array indicate feasibility of the method for simulation of large arrays."
"Scattering of electromagnetic waves from two arbitrarily oriented crossed wires is investigated. Current distribution on the wire is evaluated."
"Relationship between group and phase velocities of electromagnetic waves in a drifting uniaxial plasma is discussed. When determining whether propagation between two points is possible, the allowed direction of the group velocity vector and not that of the phase velocity vector is important."
 "It is shown that nonseparable pattern of planar array including hexagonal lattice array is obtained by using linear array pattern. The nonseparable pattern can be the same structure as pattern of any linear array."
"A theory of characteristic modes for material bodies, both with and without losses, is developed. For loss-free bodies, the modes consist of a set of real characteristic sources which diagonalize the generalized network matrix for the body, and a set of characteristic fields which diagonalize the scattering matrix. Most of the properties of these modes remain the same as those of the corresponding modes for perfectly conducting bodies. For lossy bodies, the corresponding modes have complex characteristic sources. However, in the lossy case there also exists a set of real characteristic sources which diagonalize the generalized network matrix, but their fields do not diagonalize the scattering matrix."

"An expression is derived for the distribution of current along a parasitic antenna when immersed in an arbitrarily directed and polarized incident plane electromagnetic wave. The formula is general, quite accurate, and involves only simple trigonometric terms with complex coefficients. It consists of both the even and the odd components of current. The former includes contributions from an arbitrary load at the center."
 "The characteristics of a balun-fed open-sleeve dipole mounted in front of a metallic reflector for operation in the 225 to 409 MHz band are investigated. A parametric study is made of the VSWR response as a function of dipole and sleeve diameter, sleeve length, and sleeve-to-dipole spacing. It is shown that an open-sleeve dipole can be operated over a bandwidth of 1.8:1 as compared with an operating bandwidth of approximately 1.25:1 for a conventional cylindrical dipole with the same diameter. Pattern and gain data are presented for an open-sleeve dipole mounted in front of a flat metallic reflector. Preliminary results on mutual coupling effects are also discussed."
"The cross polarized radar cross section of simple axially symmetric objects is shown to be related to transverse body dimensions and the severity of any edges."
 "A formula is derived for the peak sidelobe level of a phased array in which the elements are randomly located. The parameters of the formula are the number and size of the array elements, size of the array, wavelength, beamsteering angle, and signal bandwidth. The theory is tested by measurement of the peak sidelobe of several hundred computer-simulated random arrays. Unlike the case for the conventional array the effect of spatial taper (nonuniform density of element location) upon the peak sidelobe level is minor. The peak sidelobe of the two-dimensional planar array is approximately 3 dB higher than that of the linear array of the same length and same number of elements."
"The mechanical advantages of a singly curved conical reflector are demonstrated by the experimental test of a furlable 1.83 m conical-Gregorian antenna at 16.33 GHz. The measured gain of 47.5 dB corresponds to a net efficiency of over 57 percent. A ray-optics analysis of conical-reflector antennas is presented, and data useful in the design of conical antennas is given. The conical-Gregorian antenna, in which a subreflector is used in conjunction with a conventional horn feed, is considered in detail. A physical-optics analysis of the conical-Gregorian antenna is used to investigate diffraction and other effects, and to analytically confirm the high performance of the antenna. It is concluded that conical antennas are a valuable addition to available antenna-design concepts."
"In order to satisfy future earth-to-space communications needs, new regions of the electromagnetic spectrum must be exploited. A program to determine the feasibility of using millimeter waves for this application has been conducted at Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories (AFCRL) for approximately 6 years and it has been shown that at frequencies of 15 GHz (\\lambda = 2.0cm) and 35 GHz (\\lambda = 8.6mm) atmospheric attenuation is relatively low except for conditions of heavy clouds and precipitation. A portable radiometric system designed to measure attenuation at 15 and 35 GHz under conditions of precipitation was constructed and located in Hilo, Hawaii, a region where it rains frequently thus making it possible to conduct many attenuation measurements for varying rainfall rates. Attenuation was determined from both extinction and emission measurements as a function of zenith angle and rain rate. On the basis of the results that were obtained, it is concluded that for orographic rain up to rates of 50 mm/h in Hawaii: 1) attenuations up to approximately 10 dB can be calculated quite accurately from an emission measurement; 2) zenith attenuations are well correlated with rain rate and can be estimated from the regression lines which have been obtained; 3) attenuations at angles off zenith are not as well correlated with rain rate and thus the values obtained from the regression lines are only approximate; 4) attenuations at 15 and 35 GHz are well correlated."
"A method of measuring angle of arrival, or angle of fire, of a microwave signal transmitted over a short line-of-sight path is described. The method used is similar to that employed in conical scan, or simultaneous lobing, radars. Accuracy in angular measurement is achieved by utilizing the portion of the antenna pattern in which the gain function varies rapidly with angle. Using 4-ft aperture antennas operating at 35 GHz on a6\\frac{1}{2}-mi path, angle of fire is detected linearly with an accuracy of\\pm 0.010\\deg, and the resolution may be as good as\\pm 0.002\\deg. The effects of random atmospheric turbulence on the results is investigated. Many examples of layered structure have been observed, but the most dramatic records come when the atmosphere is unstable and large changes in refraction occur, e.g., at the onset of land and sea breezes."
"The solution to the scattering problem of a pulse incident on a low-density dielectric sphere is presented. Pulse modulated harmonic carriers and dc pulses are considered."
"The effects of the ground plane electron absorption coefficient on the admittance of a half-wavelength slot antenna radiating into a warm lossy plasma are examined for a range of plasma conditions and slot widths. The ground plane absorption coefficient is observed to have significant effects on the admittance of a thin slot when the plasma is greatly overdense, even when the plasma is only mildly warm (T_{e} \\leq 1 eV)."
"The complete radiation pattern of a 25-m diameter radio telescope has been measured at 21-cm wavelength to a level of 60 dB below the main beam response. Strong cosmic radio sources with known flux density were used as a signal source. The measurement employed an interferometer consisting of the radio telescope and a 7.5-m diameter reference antenna. By changing the orientation of the telescope, while keeping the reference antenna pointed at the source, the output voltage of the interferometer varies proportional to the field strength pattern of the telescope. This method provides a large improvement in sensitivity over a total power measurement. The paper discusses the theoretical basis of the technique. It describes the layout of the interferometer, the electronic equipment, and the methods of observation and reduction of the data. Some 19 000 points in the pattern were measured. The pattern is displayed by contour plots of equal level. The derived main characteristics of the telescope [1968 AD] at 1415 MHz are as follow: gain49.0 \\pm 0.2dB, absorption area282 \\pm 8m2, aperture efficiency 0.56, half-power beamwidth0.57 \\times 0.62\\deg. The accuracy and detail allow astronomers to reliably correct radio astronomical observations for the effect of radiation in the sidelobes, spillover region, and feed support scatter lobes. Theoretical calculations of pattern parameters may be checked quantitatively."
"Prolate spheroidal wave functions may be used to obtain an estimate of a distributed source that has been observed from an aperture of finite size. An estimate of the source distribution can also be obtained by the use of the truncated inverse Fourier transform. A quantitative measure is obtained of the reductions in the mean-squared error in the estimates which are produced by the data processing techniques. The relative merits of the two processing techniques depend upon the aperture size and the signal-to-noise ratio. The processing of data by means of the wave functions is found to be more advantageous for small apertures and for large signal-to-noise ratios. The processing techniques are also compared as to the ability to reconstruct the detail in an isolated target or source distribution of limited size. The wave functions are shown to be useful for the processing of data obtained from a large aperture that is used to observe a small target."
"The wavelength dependence of backscatter from a smoothly undulating randomly rough surface was measured over a broad continuous range of wavelengths using acoustic waves in water. The experiment resulted in discovering a transition region in which the wavelength dependence changed abruptly from\\lambda^{0}to\\lambda^{+3}, apparently due to change in the surface height spectrum. The wavelength dependence corresponded to the measured surface height spectrum through the transition region in the manner predicted by the composite surface model formulated by Wright and others. A similar spectrum-dependent effect has been found in broad-spectrum electromagnetic measurements of natural surfaces."
"This paper describes the behavior of an infinite array of parallel plane waveguides in a conducting ground plane with metallic fences perpendicular to the ground plane and spaced halfway between each pair of radiators. The study is mainly concerned with anomalous wave nulls and their relation to endfire surface-wave radiation, and in addition some data is presented to demonstrate the scan matching properties of the fence geometry. An interesting new development in open periodic structure theory is reported and is shown to apply to both surface waves and anomalous waves. Certain restrictions on the phase distributions of the aperture fields and fence currents are revealed and their origin outlined briefly. These restrictions are introduced to further emphasize relationships between surface and anomalous waves. In addition to these basic relationships, a numerical study of the scanning properties of waveguide-fence arrays is presented which has indicated that structures of this type can reduce impedance variation during scan and can be especially useful when it is desirable to scan very near to, or in the limited scan case, beyond the point at which a grating lobe moves into real space."
"The effect of using the thin-wire approximation in the integral equation solution of radiating antennas is discussed in this communication. In addition, the effect of having a source region which varies with the number of matching points used for solving the integral equation is considered. It is found that these effects can cause large errors in the solution at high frequencies and may cause appreciable error in the time domain response of the antenna if it is calculated by Fourier inversion."
"The results of experiments with dielectric obstacles of various geometries placed directly upon the apertures of circular and rectangular waveguides are presented. It is found that dielectric spheres, and in some instances dielectric cubes, two to four wavelengths in dimension produce directive patterns with low sidelobe levels. For some cross sections, the measured gain of these antennas is greater (6 dB in some cases) than that produced by optimum horns having apertures of identical cross section. The linearity of the polarization of these antennas is essentially the same as that of an open-end waveguide antenna."
"A special form of the Toeplitz matrix which frequently occurs in the numerical solution of antenna analysis and synthesis problems is discussed. Specific examples are presented illustrating its occurrence in the solution of the integral equation for a thin cylindrical antenna and in the theory of arrays. A matrix inversion algorithm is presented which, by exploiting the unique symmetry properties of the Toeplitz matrix, specifies the inverse matrix elements in terms of recurrence relationships. In this way computational time is proportional to the square of the matrix order rather than the cube as is the case with a general algorithm."
"The radiation from a magnetic or an electric current line source embedded in an uniaxially anisotropic grounded dielectric or plasma layer moving perpendicular to the line source is described. The radiation pattern is obtained, and the effects of the motion of the layer on the radiated power distribution are examined with several numerical examples."
"The equations for the transformation of the tangential electric and magnetic fields through a series of uniform cylindrical layers of arbitrary properties are transformed from their generally coupled form to an uncoupled set of two equations. The complexity of the transformation matrices is thereby greatly reduced. The decoupling operation amounts to a coordinate transformation which has a direct correspondence with the rotation of axes to the plane of propagation in the case of rectangular coordinates. The immediate usefulness of this approach for impedance transformation is shown."
"A wide-band dual-mode horn, which has a rotationally symmetric beam and extremely low sidelobe levels, can be obtained by loading a dielectric band inside the horn antenna. Measured radiation characteristics of such antennas, including the so-called shaped-beam antenna, are shown."
"Uniform asymptotic representations, valid in the vicinity of the wavefront, are derived for transient fields propagating in an inhomogeneous dispersive medium. When the space-time ray equations for these fields can be solved explicitly, the uniform representations yield explicit expressions in the space-time variables; otherwise, the representations involve a parameter which can, however, be eliminated under more restrictive conditions. The results are applied to plane pulse propagation in a plane stratified plasma with exponential variation of electron density, for which the space-time ray equations can be solved in closed form; in this case, the asymptotic representation is found to yield the known exact solution."
"The original Taylor distribution was designed to terminate abruptly in a pedestal (\\alpha = 0) at its edges. It has been found recently, however, that a pedestal cannot be realized exactly in either theEorHplanes, nor even approximately in theHplane. A new distribution is derived here that produces a Taylor pattern of order\\alpha = 1and, hence, that vanishes linearly at the edges. This edge behavior can be realized exactly in theEplane and can be approximated as closely as desired in theHplane. All practical differences in operating performance between the two distributions have been found to be negligible."
"In mobile communication a three-element energy-density antenna responding to the total electromagnetic energy density offers a way for combatting fading in a standing-wave environment caused by multiple reflections from surrounding objects. Statistical analyses show that in certain respects the performance of a magnetic energy-density antenna consisting of two crossed slots can be expected to compare favorably with that of the three-element unit."
"The scattering of waves with a Gaussian amplitude distribution from perfectly conducting and radially inhomogeneous dielectric cylinders is presented. The plane wave scattering solution is obtained as the limiting case when the radius of the scatterer is much smaller than the size of the wave. The scattering of beam waves from spherically symmetric particles was considered recently by Morita et al. [1]. In this communication the case of scattering of waves with a Gaussian amplitude distribution from cylindrically symmetric and infinitely long targets is considered. In a future contribution the scattering of beam waves at normal and oblique incidence from cylindrically symmetric fibers will be reported."
"A hybrid modal solution is developed for the circular semi-infinite dielectric rod antenna excited in theHE_{11}hybrid mode. Numerical results for the near-zone and far-zone fields, as well as the gain, beamwidth, and percentage of power radiated, are determined for three rods of different diameter and dielectric constant by enclosing the rods with a concentric metal pipe and allowing the radius of the pipe to become large. Comparison is made between these results and previous approximate methods of solution that have been applied to the dielectric rod antenna."
"Measurements are described in which the gains of standardhorns in theKandK_{a}bands were determined at a number of wavelengths. The two-antenna method was used. It is believed, after a detailed error analysis, that the gain is known within a limiting error of about 0.05 dB at each wavelength measured. A method is described for measuring the ohmic losses in the horn, So that the measured gains may be compared with theoretical estimates. Gain values calculated from the formula of Schelkunoff and Friis and corrected for ohmic losses agree within about 0.1 dB on the average with the measured gains."

"Two methods are investigated for solving the problem of plane-wave diffraction by gratings with sinusoidal profiles. The first is based on an extension of the Rayleigh hypothesis, and the second employs an analytic continuation technique for computing the field in regions in which the Rayleigh hypothesis breaks down. Some numerical results are presented to compare the two methods."
"A new method is introduced for formulating the scattering problem in which the scattered fields (and the interior fields in the case of a dielectric scatterer) are represented in an expansion in terms of free-space modal wave functions in cylindrical coordinates, the coefficients of which are the unknowns. The boundary conditions are satisfied using either an analytic continuation procedure, in which the far-field pattern (in Fourier series form) is continued into the near field and the boundary conditions are applied at the surface of the scatterer; or the completeness of the modal wave functions, to approximately represent the fields in the interior and exterior regions of the scatterer directly. The methods were applied to the scattering of two-dimensional cylindrical scatterers of arbitrary cross section and only the TM polarization of the excitation is considered. The solution for the coefficients of the modal wave functions are obtained by inversion of a matrix which depends only on the shape and material of the scatterer. The methods are illustrated using perfectly conducting square and elliptic cylinders and elliptic dielectric cylinders. A solution to the problem of multiple scattering by two conducting scatterers is also obtained using only the matrices characterizing each of the single scatterers. As an example, the method is illustrated by application to a two-body configuration."
"Mutual coupling effects in phased arrays with randomly located elements are studied. The network formulation of antenna arrays is found to be a convenient and useful approximation. Two main effects of coupling are separately considered. The first is the increase in the sidelobe level. A new solution for the distribution of sidelobe level has been obtained which is applicable even for small arrays. It is found that the increase in sidelobe level is noticeable only for small average spacing (e.g., less than 2.5 wavelengths). The second effect of coupling is that it causes the fluctuation of main-beam amplitude as a function of the scan angle. The probabilistic properties of these fluctuations are studied. In the uniformly spaced arrays the accumulation of coupling effects may cause \"blind angles\". In random arrays this accumulation is highly improbable. This method of removing blind angles is further illustrated by an experiment on diffraction gratings where Wood's anomalies and blind angles are recognized as identical phenomena. Finally, an important contribution of this investigation is the analysis by various methods of the radiation pattern of random array. The results obtained by these methods agree remarkably well with the Monte Carlo simulations."
"A class of optimum aperture distributions that gives the best mean-square approximation with weight factor (1 - \\eta^{2})^\\alphato any given pattern space factor for an arbitrarily prescribed value of a generalized superdirectivity ratio\\gamma_{\\alpha}is derived for all\\alpha > -1. For\\alpha = 0the parameter\\gamma_{\\alpha}becomes Taylor's superdirectivity ratio\\gammaand the\\gamma_{\\alpha}-constrained solution reduces simply to a\\gamma- constrained solution published earlier. But for\\alpha = -\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, or 1 the solution becomes the best, or near best,Q-constrained solution in the sense of least radiated power in the error pattern for the case ofE-plane strip source antennas or ofH-plane strip or line-source antennas, respectively. Thus, for strip or line source antennas the new solution possesses an important physical interpretation that the earlier solution did not."
"Predictions and measurements of microwave breakdown in air are compared for a conical reentry vehicle model with an overall length of approximately one wavelength. The vehicle is excited by means of a circumferential gap to form an asymmetric dipole with roll-symmetric radiation. Measurements performed in an evacuable chamber show breakdown occurring at either the nose tip or the feed gap, or simultaneously in both regions, depending upon the gas pressure. The electric fields are computed as functions of distance radially from the nose tip and normally from the feed gap by the use of moment methods. The breakdown calculation is based on a variational technique that can accommodate continuous wave or pulsed breakdown and can handle nonunifortuities in both gas properties and electric fields. Breakdown behavior is calculated at the nose tip and at the feed gap. Theory and experiment are shown to agree within the estimated accuracy of the experiment."
"Exact formulas are derived for the quality factorQof strip and line source antennas. Contrary to popular opinion, none of them is equal to Taylor's superdirectivity ratio\\gammaor to\\gamma - 1. But in the case ofE-plane strip sources (the complement of the type of strip source treated by Woodward and Lawson) the value ofQis precisely equal to\\gamma_{\\alpha}^{-1/2}- 1, where\\gamma_{\\alpha}^{\\beta}is a generalized superdirectivity ratio that reduces to Taylor's\\gammawhen the edge exponent\\alphaand the pattern weighting exponent\\betaare both zero. In the case ofH-plane strip sources the value ofQis approximately equal to\\gamma_{\\alpha}^{1/2} - 1, and forH-plane line sources of vanishing widthait is approximately equal to[(2/\\pi) \\ln (2.516\\lambda/\\pi a)]\\gamma_{\\alpha}^{1}."
"A unified formulation of the optimization of monopulse antenna performance indices for a specified sidelobe envelope function and/or specified nulls of the pattern is presented. The performance indices considered are beam efficiency, gain factor, and angular sensitivity factor of rectangular and circular apertures. The unconstrained optimization of beam efficiency result in an integral equation, the solutions of which are prolate spheroidal wave functions for rectangular aperture and hyperspheroidal wave functions for circular aperture. These functions reduce, respectively, to Legendre and Zernike polynomials in the case of gain factor and angular sensitivity factor. The double orthogonality properties of these eigenfunctions are used for constrained optimization. The results obtained by this technique for the near-in sidelobes constrained at a uniform level are shown to be in agreement with the earlier works. The method is applicable for other aperture surfaces such as elliptical, ellipsoidal, and spherical."
"A sample spacing criterion and a data minimization technique for measurements made over the surface of a plane in the near field of an antenna are presented. The sample spacing is shown to depend on the distance from the antenna to the measurement plane, and on the extent to which evanescent waves can be neglected. The near-field data minimization technique utilizes two-dimensional spatial filtering to effect a significant reduction in computational effort required to calculate selected portions of the far-field pattern. Far-field patterns of anXband antenna calculated from near-field measurements are presented and compared with those measured on a standard far-field range. The far-field calculations are repeated for several near-field sample spacings and for various post-filter sample rates."
"Presents a review of the highlights of Samuel Silver's contributions to the fields of antennas and propagation for presentation at the joint session of the Professional Group on Antennas and Propagation and US National Committee of International Scientific Radio Union (URSI)."
"The problem of dipole radiation in sinusoidally spacetime periodic media is studied and solved. The space-time periodicity can be considered as due to a strong pump wave and is expressed as a traveling-wave type change in the dielectric constant or the plasma density (i.e.,\\epsilon(z,t) = \\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{r}[1 + \\epsilon_{1} \\cos (Kz - \\Omega t)]andN(z,t) = N_{0}[1 + N_{1} \\cos (Kz - \\Omega t)]). The solution also covers the limit case of a sinusoidally stratified medium (\\Omega = 0). The solution is formulated in a matrix form, such that the basic results and diagrams apply, with minor changes, to the different cases studied: electric and magnetic dipole in a dielectric, plasma, and uniaxial plasma. The wave-vector diagram is used extensively in studying and presenting the different properties of the solution: caustics, effect of the disturbance (pump wave) motion, harmonics, radiation outside the allowed cone in a uniaxial plasma. Many dipole radiation patterns are given and their features explained physically. Finally, our solution and results are extended to the generally space-time periodic media where\\epsilon(z,t)andN(z,t)behave as\\eta(z,t) = \\eta_{0}[1 + \\eta_{1}f(Kz - \\Omega t)]wheref(\\xi)is any periodic function."
"A model for the signal received when satellite altimetry pulses are scattered back by the ocean's surface is postulated and analyzed. The second-order statistics of the complex nonstationary random process appearing at the detector input are graphically and analytically displayed as a function of the sea state. The standard deviation of various altitude estimates derived by subsequent operations on the detector output are computed, too. The analysis applies both to ordinary short-pulse altimeters and to systems that employ pulse compression."
"Antenna pattern synthesis is discussed as an example of \"improperly posed\" problems. This serves the purpose of introducing a concept that is useful in many other applications: remote sensing, inverse scattering, etc. It also suggests that regulation methods that have been devised to \"solve\" improperly posed problems can be applied to antenna synthesis and the aforementioned problems. This gives systematic methods for solving the pattern synthesis problem even when the element patterns are arbitrary."
"To enlarge the scope of the geometrical theory of diffraction, the diffraction matrix for a surface singularity where the curvature but not the slope is discontinuous is rigorously derived. The model that is employed consists of two parabolic cylinders of different latus recta joined together at the front, thereby creating a line discontinuity of the required form. For each of the two principal polarizations, asymptotic developments of the surface fields in the vicinity of the join are calculated, from which the diffraction coefficients are then obtained by integration. The results differ significantly from the physical optics estimates and are analogous to those for a wedge-like singularity. This analogy permits a trivial deduction of the complete diffraction matrix."
"A novel method of solving Maxwell's equations in a plane-stratified dielectric layer is presented, The governing differential equations for each polarization are solved in terms of Hill's functions. The formulation yields solutions which are formally exact and applicable to an extremely wide range of dielectric variations within the layer, without restriction to any particular frequency regime. The method is used to study the reflection of a plane wave polarized parallel to the plane of incidence by an inhomogeneous layer separating two homogeneous regions of infinite extent. The effect of the graded boundary on the Brewster-angle phenomenon is discussed for the case where the two homogeneous regions have different dielectric properties. Reflections from a dielectric duct are also considered as an illustration of the utility of the method."
"The full-wave analysis developed in Part I is applied to three classes of problems of propagation over nonuniform boundaries and the results are then compared with earlier solutions to these problems. The problems considered are: 1) the effects of rapid surface impedance variations on ground wave propagation; 2) the propagation over periodic structures; 3) the scattering by boundaries with random surface impedance and height functions. The full-wave solutions are shown to be consistent with the reciprocity relationships."
"A full-wave solution is developed for problems of radio wave propagation over rough surfaces characterized by variable impedance and height parameters. The analysis, which is suitable for problems involving both the radiation fields as well as the ground waves, is compared with earlier solutions to these problems. The full-wave solutions which satisfy the exact boundary conditions are shown to be consistent with the reciprocity relationships for the general case."
"Experimental results on the input impedances and the current distributions of cylindrical antennas of various lengths in a large volume of hot lossy plasma are presented. A relatively simple theory based on an integral equation and a grid antenna model is developed. The theoretical results are in good qualitative agreement with the experiments. The theory is also compared to theories of some other researchers. Because of its simplicity, the present theory may prove useful in practical applications."
"For a circular loop antenna excited by a frequency-hand-limited rectangular voltage pulse, the time variation of the electric field at remote points in various directions has been computed. The computations are for a loop of radiusbmade from wire of radiusa, for which the thickness parameter\\Omega = 2 \\ln (2\\pi b/a) = 15. The moment method was used in obtaining the current distribution on the loop due to each harmonic component in the excitation. Then the transient field is obtained by using the harmonic current distribution due to each frequency component of the exciting voltage pulse."
"A new but general method of solution applicable to any radiation problem which can be reduced to an inhomogeneous wave equation for an arbitrary source in a given medium is used to solve for the vector potential of an infinitesimal dipole radiating in free space. The solution of this simple problem yields insight into the use of this method for the solution of more complicated problems."
"A suitable impedance connected at the center of a parasitic dipole or the base of a monopole antenna can reduce to zero the reradiated field in the equatorial plane. The two-term theory provides a simple formula for the determination of the required impedance for dipole elements up to 1.25 wavelengths long or monopoles up to0.625\\lambda. Examples and tables are given."
"Transmission line theory has long been used to analyze the performance of dielectric-coated buried antennas. However, at UHF the ground cannot be assumed to be highly conducting and a new approach is necessary. A method is presented to predict the input impedance and pattern of a dielectric-coated traveling-wave antenna buried in lossless ground."
"High-resolution radar becomes limited by the feeding mechanism in traveling wave antennas, forcing the design to some form of corporate feed. A spectral method of solving this problem is introduced which conveniently handles any transmitter pulse shape or receiver bandpass. The equivalence between this approach and an older transient solution is established. The method is applied to a uniform and a cosine illuminated aperture for both one- and two-way transmission through the antenna. It is shown that as a rule of thumb, the traveling wave feed should be less than half the spacial length of the transmitter pulse in the feed (L/V_{g}T < 0.5). Antennas exceeding this length must be divided into several sections, each of which must be corporately fed."
"The main contribution to the reflected field from a radially inhomogeneous spherical shell is determined. It is shown that it is much smaller in amplitude than the field reflected by a perfectly conducting sphere coated with the same type of radially inhomogeneous dielectric."
"An exactly integrated expression for directivity is used to obtain curves of directivity versus interelement spacing and scan angle for uniformly excited planar arrays composed of discrete identical elements at regular spacings. The expression can be applied to arrays with nonuniform amplitude distributions and with a variety of ideal element factors. Numerical results are given for square lattice arrays for which the element factors were assumed to be isotropic,\\cos \\theta, \\cos^{2} \\theta, and small dipole in free space. Results are also given for triangular lattice arrays. The effect of the presence of grating lobes on main beam directivity is illustrated. The conditions for which the usual gain formulas approximate the directivity with reasonable accuracy are described quantitatively."
"A numerical-theoretical technique is described for determining the surface current density distribution and subsequently the near- and far-zone fields of an arbitrarily shaped perfectly conducting body excited by an arbitrary primary source. The arbitrary surface is described by dividing it into a number of connected cells which are mathematically described as quadric surfaces. The \"arbitrary body\" formulation is applied to two configurations; namely the radial dipole above a conducting cylinder of finite length and a quarter-wavelength monopole mounted atop the fuselage of a CH-47 helicopter. The numerical results are compared with those obtained through an experimental program as well as those obtained by alternate numerical means and good agreement is noted."
"Based on the Rayleigh assumption, perturbation solution for the analysis of scattering from a perfectly conducting sinusoidal surface is further developed. Amplitudes of scattering waves of the first few leading terms have been analytically derived; among them, the third-order term has so far not been available in other literature."
"A study is made of the input impedanceZof a small strip-loop antenna with arbitrary orientation in a cold collisionless uniform multicomponent magnetoplasma. Assuming a uniform current distribution, an integral expression forZis derived which is valid for arbitrary values of driving frequency, plasma composition and density, loop orientation angle\\phi_{0}, and static magnetic field strength. The integral expression is evaluated numerically for the VLF/ELF range in a plasma modeled upon the inner magnetosphere. Approximate closed-form expressions forZare also developed. It is found that the loop VLF/ELF input reactance is essentially identical to its free space self inductance. Also the loop radiation resistance is found to be a strong function of\\phi_{0}for frequencies near the lower-hybrid-resonance frequency or below the proton gyrofrequency. In addition it is found that for small loops a second-order quasi-static theory correctly predictsZover much of the VLF/ELF range."
"Reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves by a moving compressible plasma slab is treated. Power reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained and the numerical results of the power reflection coefficient are presented for both the cases of cold plasma slab and compressible plasma slab."
"Coherent sinusoidal oscillations have been observed in a magnetized dc gas discharge in neon. The oscillations have frequencies from 70 Hz to 7 kHz and are triggered by a small dc bias on a wire probe immersed in the discharge. The oscillation period is proportional to the cube of the applied magnetic field and inversely proportional to the cube root of the discharge current."
"The performance of a linear array of rectangular slots in a ground plane, covered with an inhomogeneous dielectric or plasma layer, is analyzed. The self and mutual admittances of the slots and the element radiation pattern are formulated for a given array configuration and external environment. The characteristics of the array are then determined for different types of feed networks. Traveling wave, standing wave, and free excitation are considered. Numerical and experimental results are presented for the gain, radiation pattern, and input admittance of a 10-element array in free space and in the presence of a reentry sheath."

"A method which involves only simple calculations is used to design nonuniformly spaced linear arrays for shaped-beam patterns. The method is based on Gaussian quadrature. The examples given show that it is possible to obtain patterns which compare favorably with those of uniformly spaced array methods. This is accomplished by using fewer elements, smaller overall length, and lower variation of element current amplitudes."

   "Radially symmetric lenses are ideally suited for use as multiple-beam antennas. In recent years, several investigations using a geometrical optics approach have indicated that simple lens structures such as homogeneous lenses might be suitable antennas. This paper presents an electromagnetic analysis of a cylindrical homogeneous lens as well as examining in detail the effect upon performance of parameter variations such that engineering and design evaluations can be made. It is shown that a lens with a relative dielectric constant of 3.5 gives the best performance. With the use of simple matching techniques, overall performance comparable to the more complex Luneburg lens is obtained."

"The far scattered fields by a semi-infinite conductor are composed of the geometic-optics and the diffraction field. By applying the technique of complex number integral, the separation of these two fields in the neighborhood and other region of the geometrical shadow and reflection boundaries is clarified. This was ambiguous in the above paper."
"A careful examination of the time-averaging procedures used in analyzing transient signal propagation through random media is made. By employing a time-domain formalism, the statistics of the time-averaged pulse are shown to coincide exactly with the continuous-wave statistics which have been treated so extensively. In contrast with previous work the demonstration does not depend on any particular form of the wave equation, the manner in which the wave equation is solved, nor on the particular shape of the transient signal. Thus a considerable simplicity in dealing with transient problems is brought about."
"Numerical solutions for the problem of radiation from an infinite planar array of waveguide horns loaded at the aperture with a thick partially dielectric filled inductive step plus an external radome are presented. The analysis is applied to the problem of matching a practical array over a specified scan volume and frequency band. A technique from which the best possible initial match is obtained by varying the step width and thickness is presented. The final broad-band match is obtained with the aid of two thin capacitive irises located inside the waveguides. Experimental verification of the analysis and resultant computer program used for the design is presented in the form of waveguide simulator results. ThreeH-plane simulators are used and comparison of theory and experiment is presented for different combinations of external and internal matching structures."

"The electromagnetic wave propagation and wave-vector diagram in generally space-time periodic dielectric, plasma, and uniaxial plasma are studied for TE and TM waves. The case of a sinusoidal periodicity is solved numerically. Special properties due to the inhomogeneity are presented."
"The effect of the frequency dependence of the conductivity and permittivity of rock for pulse transmission is considered. These high-frequency dispersive effects appear to play a major role in determining the transient response of the medium. A quantitative understanding is achieved by adopting a dispersion model that consists of multiple Debye relaxation processes. It is shown that the results differ significantly from earlier transient calculations that assume frequency independent permittivities and conductivities."
"The electromagnetic fields produced by a circular loop of current is considered for a homogeneous half-space model of the earth. The integral representations for the subsurface field are evaluated numerically and presented in graphical form."
"A novel collinear antenna constructed of coaxial cable with inner- and outer-conductors interchanged at half-wavelength intervals is described. A 26-element antenna of this type has been constructed and evaluated. Design criteria presented allow extension to the use of coaxial cable of different types in a variety of radio/radar arrays."
"A method for obtaining a desired radar scattering pattern by reactively loading a conducting body is given. The theory uses the concept of characteristic modes of a loaded body. Any desired real current can be resonated by reactive loads to make it the dominant mode current of that body. If no other mode is near resonance, the radar scattering pattern becomes nearly the same as the radiation pattern of the resonated current. A quality factorQis defined as a measure of the broadband behavior of a scatterer. Procedures for computing the real currents having minimumQand maximum gain-quality ratio are given. A pattern synthesis procedure is developed for obtaining the real current whose radiation field pattern is the least mean-square approximation to a desired field pattern. Numerical examples are given for each procedure discussed."
"An array with a general triangular grid structure (not necessarily isosceles) is considered, and methods of generating such an array are described. An analysis of its properties is presented. It is shown that this array has a grating lobe of -6 dB relative to the main lobe. The necessary conditions to avoid grating lobes are presented, with the conventional rectangular and isosceles triangular grids included as special cases. Furthermore, it is shown that one of the grid dimensions can be extended as compared to that of an isosceles triangular grid. However, when this is done, the optimal, grid area is reduced."
"The radiation characteristics of an umbrella-type reflector are studied in detail. When the supporting ribs of the quasiparabolic reflector are parabolic in shape and the surface between any two adjacent ribs is the surface of a parabolic cylinder, the deviation of the surface from the true parabolic shape has the effect of spreading the focal point of the parabolic reflector into a focal region, the limits of which can be calculated from the knowledge of the reflector parameters. The best feed position can be accurately determined by requiring that the phase error over the surface be minimized. For the cosine to the powernillumination, numerical results showing the gain degradation, the shift in optimum focal point, and the change in secondary patterns, due to the deviation of the reflector surface from the true parabolic surface, are presented."
"The formulation of antenna array optimization with variable phase and constant amplitude excitation is presented. The method shown using steepest ascents is general in that a nonlinear performance index expressible as a ratio of Hermitian quadratic forms can be optimized. Directive gain optimization of a linear array of isotropic elements is illustrated and compared with gain optimization using variable excitation. Endfire gain is emphasized and compared to the Hansen-Woodyard condition showing that the Hansen-Woodyard condition is not optimum in the directive gain sense for a discrete endfire array. In addition a0.4\\lambdaspaced linear array is optimized using phase only for scanning from endfire to broadside."
"A model is developed which explains the observed effects of secondary pattern crosstalk in a five horn circularly polarized monopulse tracking system. The model predicts unstable operation and loss of track for sufficiently depolarizing targets as well as polarization dependent uncertainties in the angular location of off-axis targets. The cross coupling is characterized by two complex coupling coefficients between adjacent horns in the monopulse feed system. This characterization is assumed to be valid irrespective of whether the observed secondary pattern effects are the result of mutual couplings within the feed structure itself or caused by cross-polarized backscatter from the paraboloidal reflector. A \"ridge\" and \"nonridge\" polarization terminology is adopted which is physically related to the fact that the error horns in a five horn circularly polarized system are heavily ridge loaded for one linear polarization and not the other."
"By application of a Gegenbauer polynomial, pattern synthesis of array antennas which have high directivity and low sidelobe level is investigated. A Chebyshev or uniform-amplitude array is included as a special case of the result obtained. The current amplitudes of the array elements are represented by a Jacobi polynomial and are easily calculated. It is shown by numerical calculations for a linear array and a hexagonal planar array that there is an optimum directivity for a specified sidelobe level within a class of Gegenbauer-polynomial patterns."
"Measurements were made at a frequency of 11.2 GHz of the signal strength received by a fixed-base station from a mobile transmitter. Distributions of the instantaneous and rms signal levels are compared for data taken in New York City and suburban New Providence, N. J."
"The problem of the scattering of an obliquely incident plane electromagnetic wave by a radially inhomogeneous magnetoplasma column of infinite length moving uniformly in the axial direction is discussed with the aid of the polarization current model based upon the Minkowski formulation in which a plasma medium is treated as a dispersive dielectric. For the analysis of the problem, a radially inhomogeneous plasma column is subdivided into a number of thin homogeneous coaxial layers, and the easier problem of the scattering by the stratified plasma column is solved instead of directly treating the wave equations for an inhomogeneous plasma column. For parabolic electron density profiles, the scattering properties of the moving inhomogeneous magnetoplasma column are investigated quantitatively with the aid of numerical examples."
"A diversity-combining technique is described which reduces frequency distortion caused by multipath propagation in high-frequency single- or double-sideband voice radio transmission. By repetitively sweeping a null through the vertical polar pattern of the receiving antenna, the relative amplitude of signal components arriving by the various propagation modes is varied at a rate which is high compared with the highest audio modulating frequency. A running average of the time-varying resultant of the various mode voltages is diode-rectified to extract the audio intelligence. Transmission nulls caused by mode interference at particular frequencies in the radio spectrum are filled in by this averaging process. The technique requires no more equipment than conventional combining and would appear to offer superior performance. A test of a three-channel version of a combiner using this principle has now been made. To demonstrate the most distinctive feature of the combiner, its ability to fill in mode-interference nulls or minima in a radio channel, special frequency-modulated transmissions were used. It was found that substantial null filling occurred and that, as expected, the filling in is more effective when a pair of antennas is spaced along the line to the distant station than when the same pair is spaced transversely with respect to that line. It is concluded that the theory of this combining operation, as described in this paper, is correct to a first order of accuracy."
"The behavior of an electromagnetic field in the neighborhood of the common edge of angular dielectric or conducting regions is determined from the condition that the energy density must be integrable over any finite domain (the so-called edge condition). Two cases are treated in detail 1) A region consisting of a conducting wedge and two different dielectric wedges with a common edge. 2) A region consisting of two different dielectric wedges with a common edge. It is also shown that near such edges, electrostatic and magnetostatic fields will exhibit the same behavior as the electromagnetic field."
"A millimeter wave receiving antenna capable of providing either 1) an omnidirectional azimuthal and a directional vertical pattern or 2) a directional azimuthal pattern capable of being scanned when it is used to illuminate a parabolic cylinder is described. The antenna consists of a modified dielectric rod antenna fed from a circular waveguide operating in theTE_{01}mode."
"In this communication, an integrodifferential equation for the current on a thin wire arbitrarily positioned between two parallel plates is formulated. Both the scattering and active antenna problems are considered in the formulation, and the numerical techniques for solving the equation are indicated. Special attention is paid to the resonances of the parallel-plate region and their effect on the antenna performance. Plots of the input admittance of various antennas are presented, as well as the results for a scattering element."
"The invariant imbedding approach is applied to electromagnetic wave propagation in homogeneous temporally varying media. As a convenient example a plane wave is considered. The result is a coupled pair of complex first-order linear differential equations for the amplitude of the forward and backward propagating waves which arise when the index of refraction of the medium is changed in an arbitrary way from one steady-state value to another. This approach provides an alternative point of view in the analysis of time-varying medium devices such as electrooptic phase modulators."
"It is shown that the radiation pattern of a hexagonal planar array with triangular arrangement of elements can be synthesized by using a pattern of a linear array. The resulting pattern has the same sidelobe level as the corresponding linear array pattern. The current amplitude of the array element is represented by a linear combination of the current amplitudes of linear array elements with constant coefficients."
"The variation with frequency of the radiated field in a given direction from a transistor-fed array is shown to be markedly reduced in comparison to the corresponding variation in a passive array. TheQfactors of both types of arrays are computed for endfire and broadside excitations. It is shown that a considerable reduction in the values ofQis obtained when the array is fed via transistors. There is seen to be a good correlation between values ofQand the bandwidth of the normalized radiated field in a given direction."
"Expanded aluminum honeycomb with a nominal cell width of 0.156 in was used to fabricate a 24-in diameter unzoned lens for operation at 55 GHz. The lens exhibits good focusing properties but its efficiency of only 18 percent reflects significant random phase errors. These errors are shown to result mainly from variations of the cell width. From the measured radiation characteristics the average width of the cells is deduced to be 0.161 in with a standard deviation of 0.003 in. Since phase errors associated with variations of the cell width are proportional to the lens thickness, it is deduced that the much thinner zoned lenses fabricated from this material would exhibit efficiencies approaching 50 percent."
"A small radiating structure has been developed which, operating on a large ground plane, maintains stable input impedance and a unidirectional-beam pattern over bandwidths of 10 to 1 or more. Impedance stability and directivity are obtained from this small antenna at the cost of frequency-dependent efficiency. Useable bandwidth, being determined by factors other than impedance match, may therefore exceed that for other small antennas with fixed matching networks."
"The performance of electrically small antennas in the presence of noise is studied. Signal-to-noise ratios(S/N)are formulated and compared to the ideal case. It is found that cooling can result in a considerable increase of the product (bandwidth)\\times (S/N). Some practical examples are presented."
  "The techniques of wedge diffraction and edge currents are applied to compute the radiation patterns of radial monopole and circumferential slot antennas on a finite circular cylinder having conical or disk end caps."
"The active admittance of a reduced-size dielectric-loaded waveguide in an interleaved phased array has a low conductance component and a high VSWR. Matching the impedance of such an element poses a difficult problem, in particular if it is desired to achieve matching over a wide frequency band. In this communication, a method to design an impedance transformer for matching such a load based on an optimization approach is presented. The computer results show that a load with a VSWR of 7 to 8 across a 10 percent bandwidth can be matched to achieve a VSWR of about 1.25 across the same band."
"Expressions for obtaining the radiation patterns for a directive continuous spiral antenna array, with a desired main direction of radiation, are presented. A suitable approximation has been made in the general formula for numerical computations. The vertical and the horizontal radiation patterns are graphically shown and discussed."
"The problem of finding the optimum current excitations for a point-detector array which extracts a signal from background noise using the criterion of maximizing the SNR subject to a constraint on the supergain ratio (orQfactor) has recently been solved. The formulation reduced the problem to one of solving for the roots of a polynomial whose coefficients are, in general, complex. We demonstrate that by making a certain transformation, it becomes possible to employ a state variable technique which changes the problem into one of finding the eigenvalues of a real matrix which is considerably faster to do."
"This paper presents the design of anX-band frequency scanned array in RG 52/U waveguide. The radiating elements consist of edge slots machined in the narrow wall of the guide. Experimental results of the measured slot conductances for the feed system and the antenna elements are given for slot spacings of 0.8 in and various slot orientations and depths. Finally, theoretical and experimental radiation patterns are compared for a 400-element planar array."
"An integral-equation technique is applied to the solution of the scattering of an electromagnetic plane wave incident at an arbitrary angle on a short thin dielectric ring. A comparison of experimental and calculated backscattering cross section is given; the agreement is excellent."
"An experimental study of the electromagnetic scattering from a conducting thin wire of V shape illuminated by a plane wave at normal incidence is presented. The echo areas for the case ofh = \\lambda/2and\\lambda(wherehis arm length and\\lambdais wavelength) are measured as a function of enclosed angle\\theta."
"Experiments indicate that the gain of a Yagi-Uda antenna arrangement depends only upon the phase velocity of the surface wave traveling along the director array and not to any significant extent upon the particular forms of the director elements."
"The far-zone electromagnetic fields of a closely wound helical antenna buried inside earth (assumed homogeneous) have been investigated. Fields have been evaluated at the interface between earth and air. The radiation pattern of this antenna is compared with that of a linear antenna placed along the axis of the helix."
"The one-dimensional Helmholtz equation for a medium with arbitrary inhomogeneities is solved by a uniformly valid iteration technique. Unlike the Born-Newman series approach, this technique does not depend on the assumption of small inhomogeneities. Here, the Helmholtz equation is first manipulated to yield, in terms of a transformation function, a Volterra integral equation whose series solution still converges when the Born-Newman series breaks down. For the case of small inhomogeneities, it is shown that the series solution, using the present technique, reduces to that obtained by a Born-Newman series-solution. Formulas for the reflection and transmission coefficients are set in terms of the transformation function."
"A recently developed phased-array feed configuration offering significant advantages over the conventional space, corporate, and series feed techniques is described. This technique, referred to as the \"flat feed,\" allows power division for monopulse sum and difference pattern illumination functions in a feed depth of less than a half-wavelength with low loss. The technique used to extract energy from the power divider, which consists in part of a radial transmission line, results, in its simplest configuration, in a circular grid of antenna elements. Relations governing the circular grid array geometry design are derived which relate the angular locations of attenuated grating lobes to the spacing between the rings of radiating elements. ExperimentalS-band hardware, built to prove the feed technique, is described. It includes a multimode launcher with measured coupling between circular wavegulde sum (TM_{01}) and difference (TE_{11}) modes of less than -37 dB; a seven-ring 1:195 radial power divider measured across a 10-percent band to have insertion loss of 0.1 dB and rms phase and amplitude deviations of less than3.5\\degand 0.47 dB; a 144-element array whose measured sum and difference beam radiation patterns are compared with calculated patterns for scan angles out to60\\degand whose sum port VSWR, measured across a 10-percent band, was under 1.8:1 with the array steered to broadside, and under 1.5:1 for other scan angles out to60\\deg."

"A detailed description of techniques developed to control and measure the inhomogeneity of the electrical properties of agar-agar has been reported previously. Various physical problems occur when one attempts to reproduce on a larger scale tests which had been successful on the smaller scale. The actual application of these techniques to the construction of the medium on a large scale is presented, along with the measured results of the circuit and radiation properties of dipoles in such a medium"
"Horizontal patterns of a linear antenna near a conducting strip are found by solving a two-dimensional problem using an integral equation method. Because of practical interest, the computed patterns are shown for only small to moderate sizes of the strips and small to moderate separation distances of the antenna."
"The aperture efficiency of a near-field Cassegrainian antenna is approximated with a Fresnel field analysis. Curves are presented which give the efficiency of the system in terms of the amplitude distribution on the feed aperture and the Raleigh distance to the subreflector. It is found that separation between feed aperture and subreflector can be as great as\\frac{1}{2}d^{2}/\\lambdawithout excessive loss."
"Calculations are carried out with regard to the aperture illumination efficiency, spillover efficiency, and blockage efficiency of a shaped Cassegrainian antenna system whose feed pattern is not similar to that for which the antenna was designed. It appears that a maximum overall efficiency may be expected for antenna systems with a feed pattern having a slightly narrower beamwidth than those for which the systems were originally designed. It is further proved that the radiation pattern of mismatched systems is very unfavorable in the case of the beamwidth of the feed pattern being wider than the beamwidth of the feed pattern for which the system was designed. This is due to overillumination of the edges."
"A low profile metallized channel guide antenna mounted over a cylindrical ground plane is shown to have excellent characteristics for sector elevation coverage. Proper selection of the spacing between antenna and ground plane allows optimum gain at the horizon and relatively constant gain over a wide elevation sector. Metallizing the sides and bottom of the channel guide improves the elevation coverage by suppressing the image of the antenna below the cylindrical ground plane surface."
"The two-dimensional problem of diffraction by a half-plane with a cylindrical dielectric cap due to an electric line source near the edge is investigated by the boundary value method. It is shown that the effect of the dielectric cap is significant for modifying the amplitudes and polar locations of the diffraction lobes."
"Matrix methods are presented for maximizing the gain of an array of thin wire antennas subject to constrained sidelobe levels. The wires can be arbitrarily bent, and they can be excited or loaded at arbitrary points along their lengths."
"To study the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the sedimentary formations (to locate trapped miners) and also in the idealized jungle environment, a boundary value problem is formulated and the fields of a low-frequency (<100 kHZ) vertical electric dipole placed at the surface of a homogeneous anisotropic conducting half-space are evaluated. Some numerical computations have been performed and the curves are plotted to focus attention on the field modifications inside the medium due to the effect of anisotropy. Significant change in the attenuation rate is observed with the change in 1) the position of the observer, and 2) the value of the coefficient of anisotropy."
"The cross polarizing effects introduced by a uniform water film on the surface of a parabolic reflector are evaluated at 10 and 34 GHz. The reflector is considered to be illuminated by an isotropic linearly polarized source at the focus, but the analysis can be applied for any given primary feed aperture field distribution. The aperture cress polarized field is obtained, and a worst case diffraction field (when opposite quadrants of the reflector are wet) is then calculated. A relatively low level cross polarizing effect is predicted, dependent on diameter-to-focal-length ratio."
"The theory for electromagnetic scattering from a special periodic structure adjacent to a stratified medium is given. The configuration consists of a parallel grid of thin wires that are located in a plane parallel to a planar stratified region. The case where the grid is outside the stratified half-space is considered first. Subject to the restriction on the thinness of the grid wires, an exact solution for the scattered fields is obtained. The final result, for the far-field scattering and transmission, can be interpreted clearly in terms of an equivalent transmission line circuit. In this case, the grid is represented as a shunt element. Finally, the theory is generalized to allow for the situation where the grid is within the stratified region."
"Statistical descriptions of the time delays and Doppler shifts associated with multipath propagation in a suburban mobile radio environment obtained from bandpass impulse response measurements are presented. The measuring equipment which has0.1 \\mus resolution in time delay and a data output bandwidth of less than 5 kHz is also described. For the first time small scale statistics of the multipath propagation for vehicle travel distances on the order of 30 m along streets are presented in the following forms: 1) average power-delay profiles made up of over 200 individual profiles, 2) cumulative distributions of signal amplitude at fixed delays, and 3) radio frequency Doppler spectra at fixed delays. Delay spreads for typical suburban streets are on the order of0.25 \\mus. Extreme cases have paths with significant amplitudes at excess delays of 5 to7 \\mus and the square root of the second central moment delay spreads up to about2 \\mus. Often the signal at fixed delays has a Rayleigh distributed amplitude but large departures from the Rayleigh distribution also occur. RF Doppler spectra at fixed delays indicate that some of the multipath is from one relatively discrete scattering center while at other delays several scattering centers distributed widely in angle are involved. The observed RF Doppler spectra are consistent with the cumulative amplitude distributions at the same delays."
"The behavior of some typical antennas or antenna systems when subjected to random fields is investigated with the purpose of determining their performance. Some relevant parameters, which are directly obtainable from a correlation matrix, are considered. Numerical results, regarding the dependence of the matrix elements and some of the antenna parameters on the illumination of circular apertures, are reported for fluctuating incident fields of variable randomness."
"The effects of random errors in positioning the elements of uniform phased arrays on the scanning pattern are investigated. Expressions for the mean and variance of the element pattern and the complete array pattern are given and a typical computer-simulated array is also studied. The curves show that the sharp dips which occur at some scan angles in the case of the hypothetical error-free array are filled in, and the blindness is completely removed for large values of the error parameter\\sigma. A simple feeding system is presented to partially correct the element phasing for the element positioning errors."
"A closed microwave resonator is derived from the beam waveguide of rectangular symmetry. The resonator is essentially a metal box with one curved wall and approximate dimensions\\lambda/2by\\lambda/3by20\\lambda, where\\lambdais the free-space wavelength. Each beam waveguide mode is shown to resonate at a distinct frequency. When apertures are cut in one wall of the resonator a line source antenna is formed. Since then = 0andn = 1beam modes have field distributions which are, respectively, a Gaussian and the derivative of a Gaussian, the radiation patterns produced are of interest in monopulse radar and tracking. A 9 GHz resonator antenna was built, and its measured radiation patterns confirm the theory."
"A method is proposed for improving the azimuthal resolution of HF radar several times beyond the limitation due to ionospheric scattering. Azimuthal resolution improves directly with array size, in accordance with standard array theory, until the beamwidth shrinks to a few degrees. Further increase in array size does not produce a dependable resolution improvement. In radio parlance, the signal is said to be decorrelated across the aperture. This \"decorrelation\" is due to scattering by the nonhomogeneous ionosphere. The scattered energy accounts for only a portion of the received wave. The remainder, an almost specular component, not only has a very much narrower angular distribution of its energy, but appears to have a much longer (perhaps 100 times) time constant of fluctuation. This difference in fluctuation rate permits separation of the two components by filtering the received radar echo. The decorrelating component is thus reduced, and the available azimuthal resolution, i.e., the resolution limitation due to scatter, correspondingly increases. When literature data are applied to the theory, a several-fold increase in available azimuthal resolution is predicted."
"In many monostatic configurations, the effective scattering volume is defined longitudinally by the radar gating and transversely by either the antenna beamwidth or the extent of the scattering region. Often the radar signal must traverse fluctuating transmission regions on its way to and from the range cell. Consequently, the return signal is perturbed not only by events within the range cell but contains statistical characteristics ascribable to the fluctuating transmission path as well. The limit of large-scale fluctuations (which is of interest in the current context) is dominated by strong incoherent small angle scattering. A systematic analytic sequence resembling that pursued by Bremmer [1] (though significantly complicated by the three dimensionality and temporal dependence of the fluctuations) constitutes the main subject matter of this study. The proposed iterative scheme, while properly accounting for multiple small angle scatter, orders successive iterates by the number of large angle scattering events they represent. While the discussion is carried within the physical framework of an electromagnetic (radar) application, an extension to the acoustical (sonar) analog is simple. Furthermore, the extension of the presently investigated monostatic configuration to bistatic ones is possible but is by no means trivial. The reported work has initially been motivated by an attempt to interpret on board radar cross section and spectre measurements associated with an ionized wake."
"A simple method for calculating the near and far zone fields from an annular ring of circumferentially directed magnetic current which may be used to represent coaxial apertures is presented. Near-field contours are given for two ring sizes. The utility of the method has been illustrated by its application in several practical antenna problems where the magnetic ring current serves as the primary source. Among these are the analysis of dipole antennas mounted on a conducting sphere or cylinder, the impedance of a coaxially fed Yagi-Uda antenna, a coaxially driven wire loop, and the radiation from a coaxial aperture at the base of a cone."
"The basic principles behind a multielement waveguide simulator are presented for the case of general symmetric elements in a rectangular or triangular spaced infinite array. The techniques are applicable to any polarization and are valid for array spacings which allow grating lobes in real space. It is shown that a single simulator containingN \\times Melements can be used to measure the reflection coefficient for the infinite array atN \\times Mscan angles. The measurement involves the determination of theN \\times Mtransmission coefficients between one element and each of the other elements in the simulator when the simulator waveguide is terminated in a matched load. It is shown that theN \\times Mreflection coefficients so obtained are actually the eigenvalues of the scattering matrix of the network formed by theN \\times Minput ports to the simulator. An interpolation scheme is presented which allows the infinite array impedance to be approximated over a large range of scan angles by means of an expansion in terms of the eigenvalues of the simulator. The physical significance of the interpolation is discussed, and experimental results for a 25-element simulator utilizing stripline slots are presented."
"The analysis and the design of elements for a large array of circular apertures on a triangular grid is approached by modeling the antenna as an infinite structure rotationally symmetric and periodic along the cylinder axis. Because of this particular symmetry, every possible excitation is the superposition, with suitable weights, of a set of fundamental excitations having uniform magnitude and linear phase progression in the azimuthal direction and in the direction of the cylinder axis (\"eigenexcitations\"). Thus by invoking superposition, the electromagnetic analysis of the array is reduced to the solutions of the simpler boundary value problems pertinent to the set of eigenexcitations. This is done by expanding the field in normal modes in the region exterior to the cylinder and in the waveguides feeding the apertures, followed by a field matching at the cylinder surface (obtained approximately through Galerkin's method). The realized gain pattern of the radiators can be modified to a considerable extent by using an \"element pattern shaping network\" (in the radiator waveguides), serving the purpose of matching the array for a selected eigenexcitation. Criteria for the network design are given. A series of numerical examples illustrate the technique and shows that a \"flat\" element pattern can be thus obtained with a gain falloff with respect to the peak of less than 6 dB at 80 degrees, and an increase of 2 to 3 dB in the gain at 80 degrees with respect to that obtained for the same elements matched at broadside."
"The current distribution, the near field, and the far field of helical antennas are examined. It is found that the application of the helix as an endfire radiator is dependent on two higher Order modes of the helix wave functions. This differs from the application of the helix as a slow wave structure in a traveling wave tube where the lowest order mode of the helix wave functions is utilized."
"A novel antenna, the TEM-line antenna, is discussed and analyzed. The TEM-line antenna in its present principal form consists of small half-loops mounted perpendicular to a ground plane and interconnected with transmission lines. Adjusting the dimensions of the half-loops and/or the transmission line lengths provides considerable flexibility in design for a wide range of applications, primarily at VHF frequencies and above. The present geometrical form of the TEM-line antenna is the result of several years' investigation of various evolutionary forms of the TEM line. Most of this past work has heretofore been unavailable in the open literature and, therefore, is summarized in this paper. An exact analysis based on the principle of reaction is presented and applied to three-element coplanar configurations. The analysis includes the effects of cable and conductor losses and readily provides for the calculation of antenna efficiency. Numerous design data have been obtained subject to the constraint that the antenna performance be optimum with respect to both the gain in a specified direction and the VSWR. These design data have been tabulated and are presented in a form that should be useful to the antenna designer."
"The propagation of a rectangular envelope RF pulse in a lossless homogeneous isotropic plasma is considered. It is desired to produce pulse enhancement by an appropriate choice of the phase variation. A time domain technique is developed for choosing the phase. The resulting enhancement is greater than that reported previously."
"An efficient computational algorithm for determining the optimum design of small nonuniformly spaced arrays is developed. The resulting design is optimum in the sense that the location of the antenna elements is such that the radiation pattern function P(u) has the smallest possible sidelobe level. Optimum designs obtained via this technique provides a definitive basis for evaluating other design algorithms."
"The gain of arrays of\\lambda/2-dipoles in front of a ground plane is calculated by the mutual resistance method as a function of dipole ground-plane spacing and number of elements, illustrating the well known 3 dB limiting case for large arrays. The effect of scanning in theH-plane is also considered and compared with the cosine approximation."
"The stationary expressions for the scattering coefficients are given for a finite planar waveguide array (FPWA) with dielectric plugs whose dielectric constants and lengths are arbitrary. The scattering coefficients defined at the air-dielectric interfaces in the waveguides are expressed in terms of the aperture electric fields only and evaluated from the ratio of two determinants. This method is useful for analyzing the mutual coupling effects in FPWA."
"A Hallen's type integral equation is formulated for the current distribution on a dipole which can assume an arbitrary tilt angle in an infinite periodic phased array. The active impedance of the dipole is calculated for various combinations of spacing, tilt angle, scan angle, and frequency."
"The radiation efficiency of electrically small multiturn loop antennas is calculated using an ohmic resistance which includes both the normal skin effect and the additional loss due to the proximity effect."
"The fields radiated by anHE_{11}mode in an aperture of a corrugated pipe with quarter-wave teeth are derived by considering the pipe to be situated in an infinite perfectly conducting ground plane. Unlike the case for a smooth wall pipe, this model is reasonable since the corrugations force the edge taper in theEplane of the pipe's aperture to be significantly increased from its smooth wall value of 4 dB. This considerably reduces the usualE-plane edge diffraction effects (those in theHplane are even less significant, being essentially the same as with no corrugations since theH-plane taper is is infinite in either case). This model reveals that theE-plane pattern of the pipe approaches theH-plane pattern (with its wider main beam and lower sidelobes) and that the radiation is nearly linearly polarized only if the aperture is sufficiently large(C \\equiv 2\\pi a/\\lambda_{\\upsilon} \\gsim 2\\pi, where\\lambda_{\\upsilon}is the free-space wavelength and a is the radius of the aperture). This is in agreement with experimental results given. (Existing solutions of Minnet-Thomas and Clarricoats-Saha based on the Silver formulation predict beam symmetry and zero cross polarization despite aperture size.) The radiation characteristics: beam efficiency, aperture efficiency, gain, and cross-polarization ratio are computed for typical horn aperture sizes (i.e., horn diameters of about one to ten free-space wavelengths). Recognition of the fact that the main beam radiation can be described by the universal horn pattern of Kelleher facilitates reflector feed design procedure for arbitrary reflector edge illumination levels."
 "TheH-plane radiation pattern of an array of parallel wires is identical to that of an array of point sources with transformed excitations. It is shown how this result applies with matrix methods for wire antenna analysis and design. Examples are given for pattern synthesis with linear and circular arrays of parallel wires."
"Extensive measurements of admittances are reported for electrically thick cylindrical monopoles driven from coaxial lines over a large ground plane. The monopoles have circular cross sections with radii in the range froma/\\lambda = 0.039to 0.140 or circumferences from approximately0.25\\lambdato0.88\\lambdawhere\\lambdais the wavelength. Results are given for tubes with open ends, flat metal ends, and ends with hemispherical caps. Graphical representations of the measured values are given over a range of lengths of the monopoles extending fromh/\\lambda = 0.05toh/\\lambda = 1.0. The ratios of the radii of the outer to the inner conductor of the coaxial lines used are near 1.2. Comparisons with available theory are considered briefly together with the related problem of end correction for the coaxial line."

 "Measurements of attenuation by precipitation at 4, 8 and 15 GHz have been made along elevated paths through the troposphere. Simultaneous measurements of radar backscatter at 2.9 GHz are used to derive, consistent with existing theoretical relations, empirical expressions relating backscatter to attenuation. It is concluded that, for rains observed at Ottawa, Ont., Canada, and provided that the hydrometeors are liquid, the empirical relations can be used to determine the attenuation caused by rains of different types. However, for situations in which either hail or an intense bright band was observed, the attenuations calculated from the radar data were grossly in error."
 "The necessary characteristics are derived for an antenna system which is to transmit efficiently and faithfully a very wide bandwidth (of an octave or more) signal. It is demonstrated that a suitable antenna for such a system may radiate isotropically in azimuth but be focused in all vertical planes. It is shown that a phase-corrected conical monopole is a convenient approximate realization of the antenna. Results are presented of an experimental investigation (inferring frequency responses from nanosecond time-domain-reflectometer techniques) of the driving-point and far-field responses of conical monopoles phase-corrected with cylindrically symmetrical lenses. Included is an experimental verification of previous theoretical predictions of the frequency dependence of the radiation which occurs when a transient is radiated from the base and the tip of a thin cylindrical monopole."
"A solution for the active array reflection coefficient in a two-dimensional array of parallel-plate-guide fed protruding-dielectric elements is presented. Analysis for this class of elements is not available in the literature. Element pattern nulls are found as in the case of dielectric-slab-covered arrays. The resonance mechanisms are also shown to be similar. Bandwidth properties of this array are briefly considered. A good agreement with experiments on two small arrays is found. Departures from infinite array theory, which take the form of a ripple on the flat portion of the element patterns and dips beyond the grating lobe angle, are shown to result from the finiteness of the arrays. These edge effects may be interpreted as arising from the interference between the \"space wave,\" i.e., the infinite array element pattern and the fields radiated by the sources induced at the array edges by a wave traveling along the array face."
"A new type of radio intensity interferometer (fourth-order correlation system) suitable for use at long baselines is described. It provides both amplitude and phase information about the distribution of radio sources which excite its two antennas. There is no RF connection between the two widely separated antennas, and consequently no RF phase instabilities are present to vitiate the correlation of the two outputs. Use is also made of the bandwidth of the signals received so that in an aperture synthesis the baselines increase exponentially in length, thereby reducing considerably the total number of baselines needed for an aperture synthesis. Conventional types of intensity interferometers suffer from output signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's) which vary quadratically with the SNR of the familiar second-order Michelson-type interferometer. It is shown that except for a constant factor the output SNR of the new interferometer varies linearly with the SNR of the Michelson interferometer, hence the name quasi-linear intensity interferometer. Such a behavior in large measure overcomes the major drawback of intensity interferometers, i.e., their poor output SNR when the sources are themselves very weak."

"The purpose of the communication is to obtain the optimum design of a Yagi array under constraints on bandwidth, directivity, or the size of the array. It is shown that the array configuration is determined if any two of these constraints are specified. The present study also shows that a properly designed Yagi array can be operated at two frequency bands with the frequency ratio approximately equal to 3.5."
"The radar backscatter of natural snow surfaces was measured at 10 GHz and 35 GHz and at grazing angles from1\\degto0.3\\deg. For horizontal polarized radiation the terrain clutter per unit area (m2) at 10 GHz of a flat snow terrain decreases from -50 dB at1\\degto -70 dB at0.4\\deg. The return is approximately 10 dB lower for vertical polarized radiation. The terrain clutter was found to depend on the free water content of the snow. The radar cross sections of ice blocks placed on the snow surface is roughly proportional to the square of the area of the ice block facing the radar at 10 and 35 GHz and is approximately 20 dBsm below the return expected for a perfectly reflecting plane surface. At 95 GHz the ice blocks become diffuse reflectors."
"Specular point densities for several models of randomly rough surfaces with a Gaussian height distribution are derived. Both area densities and volume densities conditioned by the surface height variate and surface curvatures are obtained. Several shadowing functions are compared with digital computer simulation results, and the application of the slope conditional shadowing function as a modifying factor for specular point densities is described. These densities, as modified by the shadowing function, are required in determining the statistics of fields reflected from random surfaces inducing deep-phase modulation whenever discrete scatterer models are employed in the analysis."
"A log-periodic dipole array is considered as a broadband corner reflector feed. Theoretical considerations predict a rather high VSWR and a pattern performance which is frequency independent over only a limited frequency range. Experimental results bear out the predictions and help indicate the possible usefulness of this type of antenna."
 "The dyadic Green's function technique is used to develop integral expressions for the radiation efficiency of three types of dipole antennas located above an imperfectly conducting, infinite ground plane. The three antennas treated are: 1) vertical Hertzian dipole, 2) horizontal Hertzian dipole, and 3) a vertical half-wave dipole with sinusoidal current distribution. The results of numerical evaluation of the integral expressions for several values of ground constants are presented in graphical form. The radiation efficiency of a vertical Hertzian dipole is found to exhibit a distinct peak when located at a height of one-eighth wavelength."
"A new type of dual-frequency antenna using a hollow-fin trough waveguide is described. The hollow fin is used as aTE_{10}mode waveguide with sidewall radiating elements. These Sidewall radiating elements constitute the high-frequency section of the antenna. The low-frequency section consists of a thick hollow-fin trough waveguide antenna. The attenuation due to radiation and waveguide wavelength of the trough waveguide section are analyzed. This analysis shows good agreement with experimental measurements. Existing data may be used as a guide in the design of the high-frequency section of this antenna, and the data presented may be used as a guide in the design of the low-frequency section."
"A solution is presented for the correlation function (mutual coherence) and time average power of a stochastic wave in the uniform half-spacez \\geq 0, given as a boundary value the correlation function on the planez = 0. Stationary statistics are assumed and solution is effected via a spectral representation of the field. It is found that when loss is present the evanescent spectrum, as defined for the lossless case, contributes to energy propagation; and criterion are developed which determine when the integral of spectral density can be associated with power."
"The reflected energy flux of electromagnetic waves incident upon an underdense turbulent plasma recently has been extended beyond the weak-scattering Born approximation by two different methods. One approach is based upon summing cumulative small-angle propagation effects between successive large-angle scatterings. A heuristic application of radiative-transfer methods under the same approximations and conditions yields a backscatter cross section that differs by a factor of up to one-half at given plasma thickness. It is shown that the cross section can be made to agree with that of the selective-summation approach by including a class of contributions that appears to have been omitted in the radiative-transfer approach."
"By applying Waterman's extended boundary condition a general formulation is developed for the dipole antenna of revolution. Both transmission and scattering from the antenna are considered with no formal restrictions on the antenna dimensions. As examples, the prolate-spheroidal and solid-cylindrical geometries are considered."
"High-frequency scattering by a perfectly conducting four-sided involuted pyramid is investigated. The principally polarized radar cross section at small aspect angles is derived by integrating the fields scattered from a wedge around the base termination. The theoretical results are compared with measurements and shown to be in reasonable agreement."
"Propagation of modes in an idealized model of the earth-crust waveguide is considered. The two-layer region is bounded above and below by a perfectly conducting plane. For this structure, there are an infinite number of discrete modes without any contribution from a continuous spectrum. The excitation factor for the structure is derived for voltage-type and electric, current line sources. Specific numerical results for 1 to 1000 Hz are given for the case where the lower conductive region is effectively of infinite depth. It is found that the conductivity of the upper region is the main controlling factor on the attenuation rate."
"It is shown that a figure-eight field pattern can be obtained for a wire antenna which is\\frac{1}{2}nwavelength long, wherenis any integer. Two sources are needed whennis odd and three sources are needed whennis even."

 "Reflection of a plane wave from a semi-infinite stratified anisotropic medium is studied. The medium is assumed to have an electron density increasing linearly with height. The magnetostatic field considered is in the direction normal to the plane interface. The reflection coefficient is obtained in terms of Airy functions."
"Cross polarized field intensities and values of cross polar isolation at off-axis incidence are evaluated for Cassegrainianfed and front-fed paraboloidal antennas. It is shown that the cross polar isolation of symmetrical Cassegrainian antennas at off-axis incidence is much superior to equivalent front-fed antennas, due to the fact that the convex subreflector compensates to a high degree for cross polarization caused by the concave main reflector. The conclusion is drawn that for dual polarized use of parabolic antennas in radio systems the Cassegrainian structure will give much improved suppression of cross polarization for clear weather (multipath) reflection effects, and much less critical alignment requirements."
"An experimental 95-element phased-array antenna is described that has been matched to operate over nearly an octave. Techniques used in designing the aperture-matching networks are discussed and experimental results are presented. The array aperture is formed by broad-band digital latching ferrite phase shifters in a closely stacked triangular configuration. For experimental convenience the array is horn fed from the rear. Matching of this antenna was accomplished by placing double-step dielectric transformers on the input and radiating apertures. Resonances caused by the dielectric transformer on the aperture are discussed. The array operates from 3.5 to 6.5 GHz with scanning to\\pm 60\\degin all directions. The bandwidth is limited at the low end by magnetic resonance of the ferrite phase shifter and at the high end by the aperture resonance."
"Four two-dimensional reflector antennas, the Strip, the corner, the trough, and the inverted trough, are analyzed independently by both the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) and integral equation formulation (IEF). A comparison of the radiation patterns calculated by these two methods shows that for intermediate-sized structures (0.5-5\\lambda), the agreement between the two methods is excellent. (Comparison with measured patterns is given where these are available in the literature.) Extensive calculations are also carried out to determine the ranges of validity of the methods, i.e., exactly how small a structure GTD can treat and how large a reflector IEF can adequately handle. A qualitative assessment of the relative merits of the two methods is also presented."
"Hallén-type integral equations are formulated for skew crossed wires and, by numerical solution techniques, current distributions are obtained. The coupled integral equations are founded entirely upon the familiar electric scalar potential and magnetic vector potential whereas, in the past, similar analyses have been based upon an auxiliary scalar function. Numerical results are presented for several cases, including different skew angles, and are compared with available data for the special case of perpendicular wires."
"The ground surface affects radiated and received signals of antennas near the surface of ground. By considering spatially extended current distributions, we obtain both positive and negative image results for both horizontal and vertical antennas. We present numerical results for HF with ground surfaces of soil, seawater, and a perfect electrical conductor. To illustrate the angle and frequency-to-height dependence of the constructive and destructive interference, we plot contours (of equal amplitude) of the four different image factors in terms of\\thetaand height/wavelength (h/\\lambda). These results provide insight into design considerations involving antennas in the near vicinity of ground."
"The results of an HF radio propagation experiment at 15.270 MHz over an antipodal path are presented. The observations show a large and sudden presunrise increase in signal strength that is not predicted by a computer propagation model (multihop ray tracing with some random scattering) previously used successfully for the same geometrical path on a frequency of 11.790 MHz. It is shown that the anomaly can be explained when chordal propagation supported by the longitudinal ionospheric tilts (determined from critical frequency predictions) occurring along the most probable propagation paths are included in the computer model."
"The characteristics of propagation of leaky modes in a semielliptical or semicircular waveguides with a slot radiating into half-space are investigated. The method of analysis is exact in that no infinite expansions in eigenfunctions are used. It is based on single mode representation of the field in the half-space and the waveguide with subsequent exact matching. Such modes can be used for the determination of radiation patterns of slots in infinite screens excited by semicircular guides."
"The high-frequency diffraction from a moving conducting strip is determined using the geometrical theory of diffraction. The restrictions associated with the geometrical theory of diffraction are examined and results are presented for a strip of width2ka' = 50with0 \\leq \\beta \\leq 0.8."
"The wave tilt\\thetaof the electrical field vector, the Brewster angle\\psi_{B}, and the limiting angle\\psi_{N}(by Norton) play significant roles in some radio propagation problems of communication and target detection, especially in the cases where the electromagnetic waves travel close to the conductive surface, when the polarization of the incident rays is vertical and the radio frequency lies in the HF band or any of the lower frequency regions. The possible relations of these angles is examined. It is shown that under specified conditions:\\liminf{X \\rightarrow 0} \\tan \\psi_{B}= \\lgroup \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon-1} \\rgroup^{1/2} \\liminf{X \\rightarrow 0} \\tan \\theta, for arbitrary\\epsilon > 1\\liminf{X \\rightarrow 0} \\psi_{B} \\approx \\liminf{X \\rightarrow 0} \\theta, for\\epsilon \\gg 1\\psi_{B}\\approx \\sqrt{2}\\theta, forX \\gg \\epsilon > 1whereXis a physical parameter that depends on the frequency of propagationfand the conductivity of the surface\\sigma. The quantity\\epsilonis the dielectric constant. No such relationship exists among\\psi_{N},\\psi_{B}, and\\theta. However, for given fixed surface variables\\epsilonand\\sigma, one can find a particular value offfor which\\psi_{N}is numerically equal to\\psi_{B}."
"Some corrections and a refinement to LeVine's results are noted."
"Both longitudinal and transverse correlations (and structure functions) between optical pulses received from a single source and at two separated receivers, are studied for the propagation through the atmospheric turbulence. From the solutions it is found that the longitudinal correlation extends over a rather long distance which may be several times larger than the correlation distance of the medium, and the solution for the transverse correlation is the same as the result recently obtained by Lee and Harp [1] for the continuous spherical wave case. It is also shown that provided the Rytov method holds, the results contained in this and the previous paper [2], remain valid for pulse lengths satisfying the conditionT \\gg 1/ck."
"The propagation of ionospheric longitudinal oscillations along the geomagnetic field is investigated using a three-fluid model. The complete solution for the phase velocity and damping characteristics of the three longitudinal wave modes is obtained without approximating the dispersion relation."
                  "An antenna radiating element capable of providing a broadband VSWR response and unidirectional radiation patterns over nearly an octave bandwidth is described. The basic radiating element consists of a balun-fed dipole with one or more parasitic elements (sleeves) added. Addition of these parasitic elements results in an antenna bandwidth many times greater than that of a conventional cylindrical dipole, VSWR, pattern, and gain measurements were made in the UHF band for a variety of dipole/sleeve configurations."
       "The facility at the French High Energy Solar Furnace, Odeillo, France, has been used to determine both electrical and thermal properties of electromagnetic window materials. The unique features of the solar furnace and the transmission properties of some sample types will be discussed."
"Design of the sounding waveform is an important consideration in both remote sounding of environmental targets and characterization of communication channels since it is this waveform that determines, to a large extent, the sensitivity and resolution capabilities of the sounder. It is highly desirable to be able to compare the different possible waveforms and sounding techniques with regard to sensitivity or output signal-to-noise ratio, and resolution in time delay and frequency shift. A straight-forward quantitative method of comparing the sensitivity of dissimilar sounders is developed and illustrated by an example comparing a microwave sounder and an acoustic sounder. The comparison of resolution capability is made by using the ambiguity function or delay-doppler weighting function for that waveform. This presentation covers properties of the ambiguity function and examples for the four principle types of sounder waveforms; pulse, coherent pulse sequence, linear FM and coded. A distinct advantage to these comparison methods is that they are easy to apply and can be used in the planning stage of a project since neither experimental results nor detailed design data are needed. The presentation is directed to scientists and engineers not familiar with recent developments in radar."
                                      "This paper will describe measurements of aerosol scattering in the lower stratosphere using a ground-based optical radar and nearly simltaneous balloon-borne in-situ measurements of aerosol concentrations. The experiments were conducted over Laramie, Wyoming, in late June 1972 as part of DOT's CIAP Program. Comparative measurements of this type are a necessary part in the analysis and interpretation of optical radar backscatter measurements. A review of the theory will be included, along with a detailed description of Langley's 48-inch diameter optical radar system. Emphasis will be placed on data acquisition and analysis, particularly that phase which includes separation of the molecular and aerosol scattering components. Data will be presented in terms of both aerosol scattering function and aerosol concentration using established aerosol distribution models. Aerosol profiles of this type will be shown indicating both a broad 7 km layer and aerosol fine structure layers extending over approximately 1 km in height. Optical radar data taken over a 3 hour period will be shown which clearly indicates variations of some fine structure layers. These time variations will be interpreted in terms of both advection and vertical mixing. A description of the balloon-borne in-situ counter will be given. Balloon measurements of the concentration of particles\\geq0.25 \\mum diameter, along with ozone concentration and temperature with altitude, will be presented. Finally, a comparison of optical radar data and balloon-borne in-situ measurements will be discussed. Initial comparison indicates good quantitative agreement with respect to the broad aerosol layer."
 "A theoretical and an experimental study of the electromagnetic scattering from a perfectly conducting thin wire of V shape illuminated by a plane wave at an arbitrary incidence is presented. The distribution of current on the wire is first determined by a method of moments with the aid of a computer program WIRANT (developed by Walter L. Curtis of The Boeing Company). The scattered field and backscattering cross section are then obtained by standard techniques. Numerical calculations include the backscattering cross sections for the case ofh = \\lambda/2and\\lambda(wherehis arm length and\\lambdais wavelength) as a function of incidence angle\\phiwith enclosed angle\\thetaas a parameter. To check the accuracy of the theory, an experiment is conducted inside an anechoic chamber, using the conventional method of cancellation. The frequency used in the experiment is 9.8 GHz. A number of experimental models were constructed of a copper wire of a circular cross section with a diameter d = 0.025\". The agreement between theory and experiment is, in general, very good. The results of this investigation provide an insight into the coupling effect between the halves of wire when viewed as two-coupled wires."
                     "Two array configurations for a synchronous satellite have been developed for the 225- to 400-MHz frequency band. These include an electronically despun antenna and a nine-element planar array. The electrical performance characteristics were established by means of half-scale model measurements. Both antenna systems were designed to optimize the edge-of-the-earth gain at the lower end of the frequency band."
   "Space Shuttle antenna requirements and environmental considerations, a high temperature antenna design approach, and a test program to establish acceptable antenna system parameters are summarized. The design approach combines an RF window, which provides thermal protection, with an off-the-shelf antenna. Typical test data are presented to illustrate design approach validity."
       "This paper examines the effects of multiplier offset voltages in adaptive arrays. Multiplier offset voltages arise when active circuits are used to implement the error-by-signal multipliers required in an array based on the LMS algorithm. These offset voltages are known from experimental work to have a strong effect on array performance. First, it is shown how multiplier offset voltages may be included in the differential equations for the array weights. Then their effect on weight behavior is studied. It is found that the offset voltages affect the final values of the weights, but not the time constants. How much effect they have is influenced by the amount of element noise in the array. An adequate amount of noise is necessary to minimize weight errors due to offset voltages. An example is treated to show the effect of offset voltages on the final array weights and the output SNR. With offset voltages present, it is found that there is a maximum SNR that can be obtained from the array. A specific input SNR is required to obtain this maximum output SNR. Finally, it is shown that a finite operating range for the weights places a further restriction oh the acceptable values of offset voltages and noise."

However, none of these studies take account of all the factors in a realistic way. "
"Within the two major segments of the semiconductor business, integrated circuits are expected to continue with a much more rapid growth rising from $430 million in 1971 to $490 million in 1972. Discretes, meanwhile, will grow by approximately $10 million to $630 million, by the end of ’72. It might be interesting to look at both integrated circuits and discrete products and see where the growth is expected to take place. Both digital circuits and linears are projected to grow between 117~a nd1 2%.I nt he case of thed igitalc ircuits,the greatest growth during 1972 is expected to take place in MOS."

Is the decrease in defense spending seriously affecting the rate of technological development? Are there other sources of R and D funds which the industry can use to accelerate developments? This paper addresses these topics."

"OPTICALLY-COUPLED isolators based on 900-940 nm GaAs infrared emitters and phototransistors have a serious gain bandwidth limitation which is the result of the long penetration depth of infrared radiation in silicon; 45 p and 70 p for 9oy0 absorption of 900 and 940 nm, respectively. The requirement of such a large photon collection depth prevents an effective separation of the large detector capacitance from the critical feedback capacitance Cf(col1ector-basecapacitance) of the gain transistor. Thus, the large photodetector capacitance dominates the feedback capacitance of a phototransistor leading to typical rise and fall times in the range of 10 ps. "

"The Sanguine receiver must include sophisticated design features to permit extremely reliable operation at low signal-to-noise ratios. These features include nonlinear signal processing, compensation for the effects of the ocean channel, phase tracking at low signal-to-noise ratios, and sequential decoding. The entire receiver has been implemented on a small-digital computer, and extensive tests were conducted in order to optimize the design and to gather statistical data. Experiments with actual transmitted data indicate that the receiver can achieve the predicted performance. In this paper, the structure of the receiver is described, design tradeoffs are discussed, and the receiver performance is presented."
"A practical ELF horizontal antenna requires a site of low effective conductivity. This paper describes the application of certain d-c resistivity sounding methods in rapidly evaluating potentially useful areas within geologically interesting regions, and in determining both basement anisotropy and the direction of the principal (maximum) resistivity axis. Apparent resistivity data from d-c array expansion is interpreted with a horizontal layered earth model using Harter's \"generalized inverse\" method of fit. With layered models over principal axes the effective conductivity to be experienced with a horizontal wire antenna of arbitrary orientation is readily calculated. Salient results for three geographical regions are presented."
"The ELF radiation characteristics of a horizontal wire antenna (HWA) are studied and antenna performance predictions are derived using a simplified \"image theory\" approach. These performance predictions are substantiated by the results of a 1962 full scale ELF radiation experiment using a transmitting antenna consisting of a 50 mile length of power line located over low conductivity precambrian rock between Cheyenne and Larmie, Wyoming. The transmitting antenna was energized with 200 amperes of single phase 60 Hz current. Electric and magnetic field strengths were measured over an area within a 200 mile radius of the transmitting antenna as well as at a selected \"low noise\" receiving site 1000 miles away in the Los Padres National Forest, California. Using the \"image theory\" analysis and accounting for the ELF propagation characteristics of the earth-iononsphere waveguide, the calculated near field and far field values are shown to be consistent with the experimental results."
"An ELF (extremely low frequeucy) communication system has been proposed for communication from land to submerged submarines. We present an analytical study of conceptual feasibility of such a system and discuss some of its properties. We find no fundamental technical reason why such a system is infeasible. The present work yields the general structure of the receiver, and estimates for the important parameters of such a system, Nonlinear processing ahead of the FSK (frequency shift keying) receiver in the submarine appears essential. Such processing greatly reduces the effects of atmospheric noise due to nearby lightning storms, and hence makes reliable operation possible at much smaller transmitter power."
"With the advent of the Navy's proposed ELF Communications System (Sanguine System), which would use an earth-return circuit to excite the earth-ionosphere cavity, earth-return current coupling into telephone and also power systems has become important. The theoretical basis for the coupling into power distribution and telephone systems is developed. A comparison is made between measured and predicted values of the induced voltage. Techniques which are useful in eliminating the effects of the induced voltage are described. The effectiveness of these interference mitigation techniques is demonstrated by comparing measurements on actual systems."

Daily plots of individual parameters also are available from the systems tailored to specific requests. The complex at-sea reduction/processing scheme provides significant reductions in cost and time over methods previously used."

"During August/September 1971, NUSC/NL performed pattern and steering measurements on both the NS and EW Wisconsin Test Facility (WTF) antennas. The 45 and 75 Hz near field pattern measurements were made at 13 different locations in Eastern Minnesota and Southern Wisconsin (covering approximately120\\degof arc), while the far field steering tests were taken in Mars Hill, Maine and Swansboro, North Carolina. The principal results obtained from the pattern and steering measurements were (1) the WTF EW antenna pattern is skewed clockwise: (2) the WTF NS antenna pattern is skewed counterclockwise: and (3) the effective conductivity under the WTF EW antenna is greater than the effective conductivity under the WTF NS antenna."
 "A low frequency bender bar transducer performance is evaluated considering two different pressure relief systems, high mechanical impedance squash tubes and low mechanical impedance APPRES."
"With the aid of the appropriate statistical-physical models of underwater scattering and ambient field generation, explicit first-, second-, and higher-order probability distributions of such fields as they appear in a typical receiver can be constructed. The lower-order distributions, at least, are analytically tractable, and thereby provide working statistical representations of an important class of nongaussian channels. Similar statistical-physical models can be constructed for other, broad classes of nonnormal channels, such as those produced by atmospherics, seismic disturbances, and man-made electromagnetic and acoustical interference. These models are based on a poisson distribution of (primary or scatter) sources in the medium or the given domain. For example, in an ocean or lake environment this corresponds to the usual condition of dominant primary radiation, or scattering in the medium or at its interfaces; equivalently for manmade interference, this reflects the inherently independent emissive properties of the sources involved. Here, the general approach is very briefly outlined and a number of specific results, typical of these phenomena generally, are presented."
"An example is given to demonstrate the utility and importance of a generalized theory of acoustic signal detection in reverberation-limited noise. The theory treats the significant influences of geometry and physics on the structure and performance of Bayes detectors."
"Multipath and reverberation effects in the sonar environment are analyzed in this study. The maximization of the output signal-to-interference ratio is used as a performance criterion which reduces the optimization problem to the solution of a pair of linear integral equations with the largest eigenvalue."
"Techniques for processing active sonar signals using Fourier and Walsh transforms are discussed. A method is introduced which uses the Walsh-Hadamard transform and permits excellent processing economy. This economy plus the observed ability of the resultant processor to maintain quality estimation of target range and range rate may make this system quite practical for certain sonar detection applications."
"A project is described which explores the feasibility of high rate telemetry over the short range (< 10 km) underwater acoustic channel. An experimental digital signal generator was constructed to provide a variety of modulations for evaluation. A frequency-hopping signalling format of 2.5 kHz bandwidth was chosen with simultaneous FSK and PSK modulation. Several operating modes with transmission rates from 138 to 1640 bits/s were tested at sea. Analysis of the sea test data to date has shown both the FSK and the PSK modulations to be readable, indicating that high rate telemetry can be realized with this signalling format."
"In this paper a new coding scheme is presented, which is coded by interleving two code blocks of an independent error correcting code, which exsist\\ell- blocks apart, in order to improve error correcting ability of each block. The class of codes is especially effective for very noisy channel which contains both independent errors and burst errors by analysis of block error probability using modified Gilbert's burst noise channel model. And this coding scheme has no error propagation which is often seen in the general recurrent codes."
"A method of measuring the mean rms level of a low duty cycle acoustic signal using an inverting circuit and an integrating digital voltmeter (DVM) is described. The technique has the capability of taking many measurements which are recorded, in one configuration, through a data coupler on paper tape for analysis on a time share computer. The important system characteristics are noted and an estimate of the system error is tabulated."
"Up to 8 multiplexed channels of shark behaviorial data at sea are obtained with a 40 KHz acoustic transmitter with a range exceeding 5 km and a life of up to 1 week. Conservation of battery power is achieved with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (C/MOS) integrated circuits and a pulse-interval data format of 10 ms pulses at intervals between 200 ms and 2 sec. A multivibrator oscillator is used to control the operating frequency which is essentially independent of temperature and pressure, and decreases slightly with battery voltage (<800 Hz/ 2-volt drop). An optional crystal oscillator maintains constant frequency. The pulse repetition rate is not significantly affected by voltage, pressure, and temperature. Fail safe devices ensure operation in the event of sensor or multiplexer failure."
"In 1970, the governor of Wisconsin appointed an Ad Hoc Committee to study the \"impact of The SANGUINE low frequency antenna grid on the ecology, environment, transportation, communication and public safety of Wisconsin.\" Some of the technical questions of concern to the committee have involved preducting the quasi-static near fields and properly simulating these fields in the laboratory for environmental and ecological research. Several evaluations of the Navy's environmental impact reports have been released by the committee. An overview of the recent activities of the committee and its associated technical advisory panel is presented."
"An analysis of possible performance of an assumed version of the Project Sanguine system has been made. The results are compared with those reported by Biggs and by a Lincoln Laboratory-Navy group, and qualitative agreement is indicated with the latter computations, provided appropriate assumptions are made. Assumptions made here include a sharply bounded ionosphere, antenna input resistance the same as for a completely-buried, well-grounded insulated wire, and earth conductivities of2 \\times 10^{-4}mhos/m. Limitation of performance is presumed due to atmospheric noise, and appropriate assumptions are made for such noise. Use of clipping to achieve significant signal-to-noise ratio improvement is also assumed. Although the results indicate feasibility of a Sanguine-type system, verification of appropriate conductivity values to use and of the effects of ionospheric variations will probably require further experimentation."
"Horizontal and vertical dipole antennas above and below the surface of the earth are discussed. The earth includes soil, tundra, ice, and water. Parameters are the signal frequency, loss tangent or conductivity, and dielectric constant. An optimistic or sanguine approach is used for an evaluation of a system which reverses the usual direction of higher frequencies, lower noise, and greater efficiencies."
 "An increasing need exists for quantitative studies of the circulation of the world ocean. The hydrodynamic equations with a suitable Reynolds averaging to eliminate very Small scale motion may be used to analyze the very extensive data on the temperature and salinity structure of the ocean which have been gathered by oceanographic expeditions. Hydrodynamic models may also be useful in planning future surveys as well as predicting the formation of large scale temperature anomalies in the ocean which are believed to be an important influence on world fisheries and year to year variations in weather."
"A narrowband HF-SSB system designed to meet the requirements recommended by the Joint WMO/IOC group of experts on telecommunications for oceanographic data and command telemetry transmissions is described. The building blocks that compose this ocean data buoy HF telemetry system, and their more important characteristics, are listed. Narrowband versus wideband (standard SSB 3 kHz bandwidth) HF link tests conducted between San Diego and Portsmouth are discussed."
"The Deep Ocean Optical Masurement (DOOM) System is described and results of in-situ measurements of the inherent optical properties of the sea are presented. The DOOM system measures to any depth in the ocean the following optical parameters: (1) spectral attenuation coefficients from 380 to 560 nanometers, (2) volume scattering function at a wavelength of 436 nanometers and (3) background illumination of both celestial and biological origin. Illustrative data are presented for eight cruises to the North Atlantic and Mediterranean from December 1967 through April 1972."
 "Viable concepts of ELF transmitter arrays (SANGUINE) involve an orthogonal grid tens of miles on a side, composed of roughly parallel antenna lines in each direction, buried about 6 feet deep. Multiple, buried transmitter stations are included at, or near, antenna intersections."
"Noise processing experiments with ELF (3 to 300 Hz) atmospheric noise and signals in the 40 to 80 Hz range are described. The primary purpose of the experiments was to record and analyze wideband ELF noise in order to design the noise processing portion of a receiver which minimizes the required transmitter power. The application of appropriate theory and extensive simulations led to a noise processor which consists of the following functions: (1) a compensating (or whitening) filter, (2) a prenotch filter clipper, (3) notch filters at frequencies of manmade interference (e.g., power lines), (4) a post-notch filter clipper, and (5) a phase-coherent linear matched filter. The nonlinear processing provides considerable gain relative to a linear receiver (i.e., a receiver consisting only of a matched filter and appropriate whitening filters). It is convenient to measure system performance in terms of an \"effective noise level\" which is equal to twice the received signal energy divided by the signal to noise ratio at the matched filter output. For example, the highest effective noise levels observed at 45 Hz with the nonlinear processor were about -134,-131 and -137 dB wrt 1 amp/m\\sqrt{Hz}using Saipan, Malta and Norway data, respectively, compared to 1 percent exceedance levels of effective noise for the linear receiver of about -115, 115 and -130 dB wrt 1 amp/m\\sqrt{Hz}respectively."
"A novel design procedure is applied to hydrofoil boat control systems; it is referred to as the Specific Linear Optimal Control Optimization Problem (SLOCOP). Also described is the minimization algorithm, GRASP, which is used to produce numerical SLOCOP solutions. SLOCOP requires that the boat motion satisfy linear differential equations and results in a linear feedback law. The forcing function is a discretized Pierson-Moskowitz random seaway. The free-surface effects, orbital particle velocity, and unsteady lift are modeled as sums of outputs of linear oscillators subject to random initial conditions. Surge, heave, and pitch degrees of freedom are considered. Control surfaces are actuated using fluid power. Noisy sensors for wave height, acceleration, attitude, and rate are assumed. The objective is to minimize acceleration while maintaining the foils near trim depth and control deflections within cavitation limits. The relationship of horsepower capacity to performance is also sought."
"Given an array of hydrophones at known locations in space, how should we design the array so as to maximize the output SNR? The problem has been \"solved\" by using (1) array pattern concepts and (2) multichannel filter concepts. We show that the two approaches are equivalent and then ask: When viewing the array as a multichannel filter should we design the array so as to maximize the SNR, i.e. is this a good criterion? By using the equivalence between the two abovementioned approaches, we show that the answer in certain eases is no, and develop an alternate criterion for these cases."
"Inadequate light level, contrast, or resolution can limit the maximum useful range of vision in water. Many new techniques have been developed in the past few years which offer substantially improved performance. This paper briefly reviews some of the components and systems with respect to proven capability as well as potential improvement."
"A mathematical simulation technique was developed which predicts the dynamic response of a single scoped mooring line holding a buoy in deep water. The buoy was subjected to typical ocean wave forces. The basic partial differential equations were obtained by considering the conservation of mass and momentum in the normal and tangential directions of a small element of the line. These partial differential equations were then solved on the hybrid computer by applying the method of continuous space-discrete time. The boundary conditions required that zero displacement occurred at the anchor; the upper end of the line was both stressed and displaced as the buoy followed the surface."
"Progress toward the development of generally applicable methods for calculating vehicle transfer functions is presented. Such methods would allow control engineers with little knowleged in hydrodynamics to estimate the vehicle dynamics during the preliminary design phase."
"Records of waves generated by a boat are treated to eliminate the ambient sea: \"clean\" records are analyzed to find the wave resistance (energy) involved."
"An instrument was designed, constructed and operated for the measurement of scattering of light in the sea. Continuous data on scattering at both large and small angles was recorded. Experiments were run near St. John, V.I. as part of the Tektite II Ocean Survey Program. Water samples were taken and analyzed during the experiment."
"This paper discusses the development of a unique portable underwater light which is rugged, shock-resistant, and is suitable for continuous use in air or underwater. The light is designed for general area illumination either underwater or on the surface. The light assembly consists of a 10,000 lumen tungsten-halogen lamp, a heat treated globe, a heat-sinked fixture, and a cable reel with appropriate electrical connections. When operated in air the fixture stabilizes at a temperature of approximately 850 degrees F, and it may be immersed in cold water while in operation without damage. The fixture will withstand static pressure in excess of 2000 PSI."
"The intent of this paper is to suggest areas where beneficial changes might be made in the display of underwater scenes. Presently, the turbidity of the water medium produces a rapid scene-brightness fall -off that carries over into the system's display. In addition to this problem, the second-generation viewing systems (range gate and synchronous scan) possess spatial peculiarities that appear as voids in their displays. Voids or rapid graying-out of the scene or both can be moderated by certain system gain-control techniques. In addition to presenting approaches to range-controlled gain, this paper restates the criteria, or conditions that can reasonably be expected in the display. The major effort, however, is directed to modifications applicable to the range-gate and synchronous-scan systems because the greatest departures from the display criteria are found in these systems."
"A real time dereverberator was tested in an attempt to eliminate multiples on marine reflection seismograms. The whole system consists of a4 \\times 30-m sectional array, a slacking winch used to stop the array during the recording period, a 1000-in3airgun with a pulse shaper, four programmed gain amplifiers, a time varying mixer, a time varying bandpass filter and a real-time correlator and dereverberation filter. A peak pressure noise figure of less than 1\\mubar in the frequency band of 16 to 60 Hz is attained with the system. Record comparisons are presented to show the advantages of the various components of the system. Dereverberated records expose real events which are otherwise masked by multiples."
"A system has been developed for attachment to sediment corers to obtain an in situ acoustic velocity profile during a coring operation. The system uses two electroacoustic transducers mounted in the cutting head of the corer and associated electronics circuitry to measure the travel time of an acoustic pulse traversing the diameter of the sediment core. Laboratory and field tests have been conducted and the results show that the system provides useful information. Acoustic velocity profiles were obtained in the Gulf of Mexico using a piston corer and in shallow coastal waters using a hand corer."
"A long range acoustic side scan echo ranging system has been tested in the region east of the Bahama Islands and the Blake Plateau. The system employs a discrete, linear hydrophone array towed at an approximate depth of 600 m. Deep explosive charges fired at regular intervals serve as sound sources. Reflections were returned from the Bahama and Blake escarpments at ranges up to 370 km and can be correlated with known topographic relief. This ranging system test clearly shows the possibilities of making long range bathymetric surveys."
"Multiple reflections in the water column often make the detection of deep seismic reflectors in oceanographic exploration very difficult. A novel method of modelling the unwanted feedback generating these multiples is introduced. This model formulates the removal of the multiples as a system identification problem, and the maximum likelihood method of statistics is used to derive an algorithm for estimating the model parameters. This algorithm can be implemented on a small on board computer and yields an enhanced performance over comparable methods previously used. Experimental results of applying the algorithm using data taken aboard the R/V Atlantis II of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute's IDOE cruise to the Southwest African coast are presented."
"The ability to interpret and define the data on a conventional depth sounder record is compared to the same or like data which has been correlation processed. Environmental conditions and equipment features which improve these conditions and features are summarized."
"A concept for storing energy in small silver-zinc cells enclosed in pressure proof glass instrument housings is presented. These Energy Spheres can be configured to cover a large range of weight to displacement ratios. The resulting energy storage systems are shown to be highly competitive with the popular pressure balanced systems used in many submersibles."
"The marine sediment in-situ probe and coring assembly is a lightweight, hydrostatically anchored multi-probe assembly with a centrally located corer. It is used to measure sediment acoustic, thermal, and mass physical properties during incremental penetrations to the five foot sediment depth level, in water depths to 5000 feet. This assembly is operated from an electric d.c. power supply and can function from submersibles or surface vessels. An hardwire FM multiplex telemetry system provides command/control and data transfer between the assembly and the vessel. Preliminary investigations have shown these core samples to be considerably less disturbed than conventionally obtained cores. Present research includes design programs in hydrostatic anchoring and sediment shear strength, and continued work on correlation of parameters determined from this assembly and conventional corers."
"This paper describes the formulation and testing of an analog computer model to predict the variation with time and depth of the Ekman drift velocity. The mathematical model used in the simulation is the one developed by Ekman. The model is tested on an analog computer to determine the response to a step-function wind assuming a uniform vertical eddy viscosity coefficient. This particular case treated provides a test for the analog model, as an analytical solution for this case already exists."
"This report presents an optimal maintainance policy for deep submergence equipment for which the following assumptions hold: (i) The system deteriorates with time and finally fails to operate; (ii) It is impossible either to repair the system or to observe its level of deterioration without bringing it to the surface; (iii) Even in a badly deteriorated state the system can perform its function although with a substantial loss; (iv) The observation and repair of the system are quite expensive because of assumption (ii). Using a Markov decision process as a model, maintainance policy is derived which is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the return from the operation of the system with respect to the high costs for its observation and repair."
"A simplified model has been developed for the difference-frequency sound source level generated by a parametric radiator. Numerical values computed for a variety of conditions compare favorably with experimental data."
"Electromechanical and piezoelectric acoustic transducers are shown to be mathematically model-able by a common state-variable formalism. In the three cases considered the matrix differential equations are completely controllable and completely observable, so state-variable compensation is possible. A simplified derivation of the Kalman Observer(1) is presented, illustrating how the internal transducer state-variables are obtained from the observer filter even though they are not directly available from the transducer. These variables which are signals within the Kalman Observer(l), are used in a state-variable feedback compensation scheme which has the capability of placing the closed-loop transducer-observer filter system poles arbitrarily in the complex plane. References for the Luenberger Observer(2) approach are given. Theoretically therefore, at least in the linear mode, transducers may be compensated to have arbitrarily sharp transient response without ringing, as well as a very wide-band frequency response. Similarly, the Q and resonant frequency are also arbitrarily compensatable. This compensation scheme may also be viewed as a generalization of the well-known negative damping-factor idea to obtain not only an effective negative source resistance, but also negative mass, viscous damping, spring stiffness, resistance, capacitance, and negative inductance in desired places in the transducer equivalent circuit. However, extreme response improvement also requires large input power, which leads to a violation of the linearity assumption; so the practical improvement possible depends on the linearity of the transducer until nonlinear transducer models and nonlinear observer theory is improved."
"On 18 August 1970 the WW II Liberty Ship SS LeBARON RUSSELL BRIGGS, loaded with 12,500 M-55 rockets containing nerve gas, was scuttled in 16,600 feet of water 282 miles east of Jacksonville, Florida. Hydrophones and tape recorders were used to monitor the sinking of the BRIGGS. A recording made 2,000 feet from the submergence location was analyzed and 14 events located. The 14 events were identified and their probable causes determined. Based on the recorded signals, it was concluded that there was no significant release of nerve gas during the plunge to the bottom."
"The characteristics of sound transmission, reverberation, and ambient noise under ice differ significantly from those found in the waters of more temperate regions. The environmental factors and their influence upon acoustic behavior in the Arctic and Subarctic are discussed. Problems associated with expanding the data base for prediction of system performance in this adverse environment are presented."
"The underwater acoustic homing system described here is used to lure an arctic research vehicle back to its recovery hole. It makes use of a 28 kHz beacon which emits 4 ms pulses four times per second. The receiver in the vehicle employs two transducers spaced 3/8\\lambdaapart which are used for bearing detection, and a third omnidirectional transducer used for sense detection. Phase comparison is employed in bearing calculation and time difference in sense determination. The circuit also includes logic which rejects impulse noise and requires: a pulse amplitude > -100 dBV, 3 ms pulse duration, pulse rate of two to five pulses/sec, five out of eight valid pulses, and a stationary source (phase rate of change < 10 degrees/sec). The homing range of this system is over 5000 yd."
"Burying submarine cables in the sea bottom is indispensable to protect them from injury arising from fishing activities and anchors. The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation has been making continuous efforts to develop a method for burying submarine cables and has recently completed a new system called the \"towed attached guiding equipment simultaneous laying-burying system\". This paper describes this system and outlines the installation work between Matsuyama and Kure which was recently completed by this system."
"This paper describes the problems associated with the underwater transmission from an offshore generating station, Included is a description of the cable requirements, types of cables proposed by suppliers and the research and development required in order to optimize the cable installation."
"Following the very successful application of extruded polyethylene insulation to coaxial submarine telephone cables, the first high voltage power transmission circuit using this insulation under water was energized in 1968 at Cook Inlet, Alaska. The accumulated experience with 138 kV solid dielectric submarine cables now amounts to nearly 30 circuit-mile-years without a single electrical underwater fault. The major advantages of this new form of cable are simplicity in construction, easier installation, and lower electrical capacitance and thermal impedance. The critical length of a 138 KV cable with 2000 MCM conductor is 150-200 miles, depending on sediment thermal resistivity. Extruded polyethylene insulation, therefore, makes it possible to transmit ac power over long distances under water."
"A description of the plant which will be constructed at the manufacturer's facility. A description of the manufacturing facility will be included as well as a discussion of the special plant design features which are needed for this concept."
"Locating nuclear electric generating stations offshore provides almost an unlimited number of plant sites for Coastal State utilities. The Federal Territorial Limits extend to 3 nautical miles beyond the shoreline. For efficient operation related to ease of personnel and consumable supplies transportation these plants will be located near harbors and inlets. This paper describes the criteria for site selection in the ocean, the support facilities on the shore, the breakwater required to protect the plant and the studies that will be made to verify the design of the offshore plant."
"Public Service Electric and Gas Company believes that the concept of building offshore nuclear power plants in the Atlantic Ocean offers major advantages: an abundance of water, zero resident population, and a minimal impact on The environment. The barge-mounted, breakwater-protected design has significant qualities. The plant will be built in a shipyard facility with \"shop-type\" skilled labor concurrently with the construction of the ocean-sited breakwater and supporting facilities. Construction schedules will be shortened, costs can be reduced, and quality of plant will improve. Also, standard designs can be developed and licensing problems may be eased. This farsighted concept for power plant siting introduces a real solution to many of the problems confronting land-sited plants."
"A method of acquiring, processing and disseminating oceanographic and meteorological data from ocean platforms is described. The application of well known and mature technology is utilized in performing the data acquisition and telemetry functions. Following a brief introduction dealing with National Data Buoy System communication approaches, the shore communication station is described in terms of equipment capability and system operation. Finally, a brief discussion on initial system performace is presented."
"Approximate results are obtained for the acoustic response due to a steady-state point source in a semi-infinite liquid overlying a viscoelastic halfspace. The study is intended for application to the acoustic classification of sediments on the continental shelf. The response in the acoustic field is formulated as a Green's function expressed in an integral form. The integral is evaluated approximately for two cases corresponding to two types of experiment: one for nearbottom testing, and the other for oblique-incidence testing in the radiation zone. Evaluation of the integral yields various expressions, each representing the leading term in an asymptotic expansion. The terms are interpreted physically as reflected, lateral (refracted) and surface waves. The types of response for both cases are discussed and compared with previous results."
"The acoustic response due to a point source in a liquid layer overlying a semi-infinite multilayered viscoelastic medium is obtained using a Green's function formalism. A matrix recurrence relation, developed from the boundary conditions, is used to relate the scalar wave functions in the last viscoelastic layer to the scalar wave functions in the intermediate layers using (4 \\times 4) matrix manipulations. The transformed form of the Green's function is then obtained by applying appropriate boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the liquid layer. The Green's function is then written in integral form convenient for computer evaluation, since the integrand can be computed for many layers using the recurrence relation. Special cases are discussed and compared with known results."
"A vane shear device was developed for in-place measurement of the undrained strength of clays in the marine environment. This device required a measurement of torque applied to a vane as the soil in which the vane was embedded failed in shear and was remolded. The system was designed to operate at depths of 4.5 km and to conduct measurements at depths up to nearly 3 m below the mudline. Control signals to and data from the apparatus were telemetered over a single wire with ground return and the tower was self-powered. Torque measurements required successful use of electrical stain gages and leads exposed to high hydrostatic pressures. The apparatus has been successfully operated at several sites in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Gulf of Mexico at depths of 3635 m."
"Application of Differential OMEGA to measurement of position and velocity of automatic at-sea oceanographic data collection devices is addressed. For example, choice of a system to provide position and velocity information is conditioned on several factors including simplicity of equipment operation, reasonable per-unit cost and world-wide all-weather availability of navigation signals. In this light, the OMEGA radio navigation system and, in particular, the Differential configuration are briefly discussed including description of statistical models for OMEGA errors. A suggested data processing scheme based on the Kalman filter is presented; the filter makes optimal use of postulated system models to appropriately weight Differential OMEGA measurements given statistical knowledge of various environmental effects. Numerical results are obtained in the form of root-mean-square accuracies in estimating ocean currents. Although there are certain as yet unresolved operational factors, the results are seen to be promising suggesting potential advantage to the scheme."
"This paper presents a review of the experimental data on the refraction of underwater explosion shock waves. Broadband pressure-vs-time recordings are described, and their characteristics are related to the appropriate regions of calculated ray diagrams: shadow zones, caustics, single-arrival, and multiple-arrival regions. Although the experiments were directed toward explosive applications, the results are useful for acoustic research also in that the broadband pulse recordings provide clear data on pressure amplification, arrival angle, relative arrival time, and phase shift, for each arrival in a multiple-arrival pulse."
"The Moored Limited Capability Buoy (MLCB) presents some interesting design considerations for the system designer of the on-board data processing system (DPS). The DPS is the heart of the MLCB electronics system, the other major blocks consisting of a communications system and a sensor system. The DPS performs the necessary timing and control for all on-board functions, as well as processing and formatting of the euvironmental data which is acquired by the MLCB. This paper discusses the design considerations which must be explored in performing the DPS system design. This design work was completed by Lockheed Missiles and Space Company under contract to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)."
"Magnetic field components generated by ocean swell correlate with other swell-induced ocean parameters. Simulated magnetic fields are related to other measured ocean parameters through transfer functions. Simulation criteria are continuous power spectral density functions and realistic time variation of waveforms of the simulated field."
"An optically pumped rubidium 87 vapor magnetometer is described which measures the earth's magnetic field to one part in3frac{1}{2}million. The sensitivity is about .01 gamma in the earth's field of 52,000\\lambda(0.52 oersteds). Rubidium 87 is preferred to rubidium 85 because the nuclear spin is 3/2 rather than 5/2. Thus the magnetometer described can \"lock on\" to a single hyperfine absorption line and not show orientation effects common in self-oscillating rubidium 85 magnetometers. Two magnetometers are used in offshore surveys, one fixed and one towed behind a vessel. The record of the fixed stations is subtracted from the moving station record thereby eliminating the time variations of H. Space variations are interpreted in terms of subsurface structures. In particular, negative magnetic anomalies may indicate salt domes usually having oil around their perimeters."
"Since 1969 the Canadian Hydrographic Service has been active in the development of a semi-automated hydrographic survey system. The Hydrographic Acquisition and Processing System (HAAPS) employs hard-wired data loggers weighing 68 kilograms and having a power requirement of 350 watts at 24 volts d.c. Installed in 7.6-metre survey launches, the data loggers are used to record digital depth and position data on magnetic tape. A computer facility is carried on the mother ship. Depth data are edited by the computer to retain the deeps and shallows required to delineate the topography. The criterion is such that overprinting does not occur when the selected depths are plotted. Processed data will be eventually used as the input to an automated cartographic system."
"The design features of a free-floating data buoy for underwater acoustic measurements are described including a PCM RF telemetry link, one bit synchronization insertion techniques, and extensive use of MOS integrated circuits."
"The enormous amount of marine seismic data makes it necessary to process the data with a high speed digital computer. This paper is concerned with the application of digital signal processing techniques to the marine seismic data. The objectives of the study are two-fold: (1) to improve the data, i.e. to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the data and (2) to reconstruct the seismic profile from the digitally filtered data for a better interpretation of the ocean bottom and the subbottom structure. Cepstrum analysis, deconvolution, and Walsh domain processing of the data are discussed and the unpublished computer results are presented in detail."
"HUDSON-70 was a multidisciplinary oceanographic cruise encircling North and South America. The aim of the expedition was to make a significant contribution to the exploration of the world's oceans at the beginning of the International Decade of Ocean Exploration. The program included the total spectrum of oceanographic studies of interest to scientists today covering the fields of the life sciences, physics of the oceans and the earth sciences. Probably one of the main achievements for oceanographic studies was the opportunity to use identical measuring equipment in the two major oceans of the world - the Atlantic and Pacific, and at the same time obtain data in areas where little, if any, information was previously available particularly in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. This paper will review some of the more important scientific results of the cruise."
"A comparison of the use of magnetic or electric dipole sources in geophysical exploration and the detection of conducting objects in a lossy environment such as the ocean was made through numerical evaluation of signal levels for orthogonally positioned electric and magnetic transmitter-receiver systems traveling along linear paths near such objects."
"Laboratory experiments show that salt-finger regions differ from diffusive and convective regions by the scattering of acoustic energy. An application to oceanographic sampling is discussed."
"The design considerations peculiar to underwater television systems are described and discussed. The LLLTV camera can provide a means of compensating for the losses in the underwater environment due to spectral filtering, attenuation and decreased scene contrast to provide a feasible system design. LLLTV will allow use of ambient light for biological, geological and environmental studies at increased observation ranges. It is concluded that highly sensitive TV cameras have definite application in underwater television systems."
"A capacitive wavestaff with nominally linear amplitude response and flat frequency response from 0.02 to 1.5 Hz is described. The wavestaff uses standard low power circuits, is small (5.1 \\times 10.2cm plus probe wire), and is light weight (0.34 kg plus mounting hardware and cables). System electronics, calibration and field use are discussed. Representative wave data for Lake Travis, Texas are given."
"A new technique has been developed whereby the outputs from a towed Side Looking Sonar can be presented as a real time display in a standard television format. The system uses a video disc recorder and short-term storage registers to scan convert the sonar data. The sonar data is obtained at a low frequency and is changed to a rate suitable for television. The television picture displays a view of the ocean bottom, in a \"moving window\" format. The result is a flicker-free, moving display of the sonar data."
"The life of electrical insulation in water is limited by steam (24 psig) which shows three orders of magnitude reduction in life as determined by AIEE #57. Power equipment in water must be temperature controlled to avoid the steam condition. This means larger volume of equipment, lower power densities and lower temperature rise above the ambient. If this is not done by the designer then the operator is forced to downrate the equipment to preserve useful life. To overcome this limitation in size one must develop steam resistant electrical insulation in order to be able to operate at higher temperatures. Techniques to seal the system to exclude water are not satisfactory because small amounts of water passing through barriers or internally generated in the system, may be the equivalent of operating the electrical equipment in 100% steam if temperature is not controlled."
"A self-recording thermistor buoy system was developed at the SACLANT ASW Research Centre to registe the variability of temperature in the upper ocean. The system consists of 20 thermistors spaced on a vertical cable between the sea surface and 250 m. The thermistors are incorporated into parallel RC circuits which, when electronically triggered, produce a pulse train wherein the individual pulse arrival times are an analog of the temperature at each sensor. The sequence, repeated every 3 min., is FM recorded within the buoy. A field experiment utilizing three buoys placed in a triangular array 8.5 km on a side, was performed in the Western Mediterranean. The buoys, taut moored in 2600 m depths and supporting recording current meters were equipped with acoustic/ time releaser systems; they recorded data for periods from 4 to 9 days. Field methods, buoy performance and data, processing techniques are discussed."
"The effects of high pressure on the performance of active semiconductor devices are determined by both the number of times the device is exposed to the pressure and the duration of this exposure. The damage that results from either or both types of exposure is of three types; (1) structural damage, (2) physical device damage and (3) chemical damage. The anticipated effects of each damage category on the device to be tested dictated the test procedure for that device. Included in the testing procedures is failure analysis of all failed devices. Test procedures are described, test results are given and pressure-induced failure modes are identified for (1) small signal and power transistors in hermetic, plastic and epoxy packages, (2) junction field effect transistors in epoxy packages, (3) integrated circuit (IC) operational amplifiers in plastic and ceramic packages, (4) IC power supplies, (5) digital ICs and (6) resistors. Finally, a list is provided of devices that have a demonstrated ability to operate at deep ocean pressures."
"Although salt water batteries based on magnesium alloys and silver chloride have been used for several years, they present several problems, the most important of which is the very high cost. Alternate systems utilizing lead chloride or cuprous chloride have achieved only moderate success. The present research relates to a high energy low cost salt water battery based on an aluminum alloy in conjunction with fused-cast lead chloride-cuprous chloride mixtures with enhanced porosity. Operation has been demonstrated over extended periods with a performance of 35 Wh/lb and satisfactory operation down to-2\\degC. The aluminum alloy avoids the corrosion product problem associated with magnesium and makes interrupted operation feasible. The small sacrifice in working potential is more than compensated by improved discharge characteristics. Fundamental and technical aspects of the lead chloride-cuprous chloride composite electrodes are discussed in relation to optimizing performance. Applications include many medium and high power situations for which existing batteries are unsuitable or too expensive."
"The highly stable propagation characteristics of VLF transmissions make them an ideal source of world-wide navigation data. The arrival phase of a VLF signal is continuously compared with a local standard. The change in the phase difference between the received signal and the local standard is converted to relative motion with respect to the VLF transmitter. Very low frequency transmissions form the basis of a very accurate long range navigation system. The characteristic of these transmissions that make them ideal for such a use is that their arrival phase at a point distant from the transmitter is both stable and predictable."
"Two prototype solid-state switching devices and a multiplexer system were designed, fabricated, and successfully tested to demonstrate the use of solid-state devices under hydrostatic pressure cycling to 13,500 psi. The two switching devices were designed to use 24-Vdc voltages in controlling the application of 120-Vdc supply voltages, with a steady-state current of 10 A and surge currents of 100 A, to 1000-W incandescent lamps. One device, using silicon-controlled rectifiers, requires less than 0.06A and has a leakage current of about1\\muA. The second device, using power transistors, requires less than 0.13 A and has a leakage current of about4\\muA. The multiplexer provides 32 channels for control or instrumentation, but requires only four pressure-vessel penetrations. Testing of the prototype devices has demonstrated the feasibility of adapting solid-state devices for use in deep-ocean environments."
  "Presents the back cover of this proceedings volume."
  "In writing about tidal energy it is simple enough to chronicle the history of attempts to generate it, starting with the medieval tidal mills of Western Europe and examining some of the many ingenious ideas which have been propounded by engineering writers from many countries since then."
"This paper describes a prototype antistranding sonar system developed in a joint program by Raytheon and the Office of Research and Development of the Maritime Administration. The system displays ranges to both discrete underwater obstacles and shoaling conditions in a ship's path. The theory of operation, hardware developed and the results of initial R & D experiments are presented and discussed,"
"The environmental considerations and the supporting program of studies for the offshore nuclear generating station is described and some of the anticipated environmental effects of the plant are discussed. A large amount of on-site investigation, laboratory experiments, and analysis is being carried out as a basis for an accurate prediction of the environmental impact. Physical models of the breakwater are being tested for wave effects. An on-site ecological survey is including sampling of the marine biota on an extensive scale. A prediction of the thermal effluent release pattern is being conducted by both computer model and physical modeling. An oceanographic survey is measuring currents, temperatures, etc. Measurement of the existing natural background of radiation will be conducted. No adverse effects on the environment are predicted from studies conducted thus far."
"This paper describes the design for a versatile digital processor using MSI logic circuits. The operations of filtering, correlation, beamforming, and spectrum analysis are easily handled in real time from signal sources encountered in sonar, seismic and underwater telemetry systems."
 "Fisheries biologists using acoustic stock assessment systems need a signal processor that will provide an estimate of the fish target strength density function. The estimated density function can be used by the biologist to determine the fish size distribution within the surveyed population and to Convert the output of an echo integrator into a density estimate. A method for extracting the target strength density function from the acoustic pulses reflected from the fish is described in this paper. The results of a Monte Carlo simulation of the technique are presented."
"Investigations into the migratory habits of salmon have shown that population sampling in particular areas of the North Pacific can help to predict the spawning migration to Bristol Bay, Alaska, the succeeding year. This population indexing has been done with standard purse-seining gear operated at a fixed series of stations. Such indices of population size have proved useful to both the fishing industry and the management agencies in planning their respective operations. This paper describes an acoustic sampling system developed at the University of Washington which will be used to help index this salmon population."
"Two field trips were made to the Barataria Bay area in the fall of 1971. On each trip several excursions were made out in the estuaries to determine the ambient noise levels at various locations. The data was analyzed to determine the power spectra; and the relative acoustic activity was correlated with known oceanographical parameters."
"The paper discusses initiation of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Marine Fisheries Service's Program, Mississippi Test Facility, Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, to accelerate application of remote sensing to fisheries. Facility is designed to provide controlled biological environment in which tests can be conducted under near natural conditions. History of at-sea and tank tests conducted prior to establishment of the present facility is discussed; also, results gained from these efforts. Description of system's current configuration to support marine organisms under controlled conditions, limitations of system, because of its unique location and capabilities, includes testing of: 1) aerial remote sensors of fish and environmental parameters, 2) subsurface systems such as hydroacoustics and other subsurface techniques, and 3) detailed observations of marine species behavior under simulated conditions. Current activities include biological stabilization of system, effectiveness of recent tests, and planned experiments."
 "An experimental measurement program has been conducted to determine parameters for propagation in the 40-50 and 70-80 Hz range. These measurements have utilized a transmitter in Wisconsin radiating approximately 0.25W at 45Hz and 0.5W at 75 Hz. Simple sinusoidal signals have been received and estimated at several sites, some on the same great circle path. Sites have been located in Nova Scotia, Utah, Hawaii, Norway, Greece and Saipan. Based on a simplified propagation model it has been possible to estimate attenuation rates and mode excitation factors with high accuracy subject to some constraints which are discussed. Both daytime and nighttime attenuation rates and excitation factors are discussed."
"Radio waves of frequency below about 1 kHz propagate around the earth-ionosphere cavity with very little attenuation. These waves also can propagate useful distances down into the ocean. They are attractive therefore, for providing long-range communication to submarines from a single site. By considering the various components of the communication channel in turn, the paper develops the design principles for such a system. Significant features are the use of insulated horizontal dipoles, grounded at each end, as the antennas, an optimum operating frequency below 150 Hz, non-linear processing in the receiver to reduce the effective atmospheric noise, and the large size but sparse installation density of the transmitting antenna."
"The technical basis of Project Sanguine is outlined. This U. S. Navy-sponsored project has a stated objective to develop a world-wide communication system that can be used to send messages to submarines at operation depth. Until recently, the work has been shrouded in a cloak of secrecy. Attention is called to the fundamental electromagnetic propagation studief that preceded the 10-year engineering development of the system that has not yet been \"validated''. Some of the recent widely publicized criticisms are put in perspective and various conclusions are drawn."
"During 1964, RCA developed the H/I conductivity measurement technique as the most appropriate method of determining the effective earth conductivity for the siting of an ELF transmitting system. In the fall of 1964 and the summer of 1965 and 1966, measurements by this technique were carried out at 43 different locations in Northern Wisconsin and Northeast Minnesota. Most of these locations were in the area where the geology was indicative of low conductivity or in areas adjacent to the indicated low conductivity area to determine if the region of low conductivity extended beyond the geological boundary. The measurements indicated a high degree of correlation between low conductivity and those areas for which the surface geology projects a shield area of Pre-Cambrian origin. Twenty-seven sample measurements within the shield area of Northern Wisconsin give an effective value of conductivity of1.6 \\times 10^{-4}mhos/m at 78 Hz with upper and lower standard deviation limits of1.9 \\times 10^{-4}and1.25 \\times 10^{-4}mhos/m, respectively. 1968 measurements along the Test Facility lines give values in agreement with the above."
"Modulation and coding techniques yielding signaling waveforms suitable for use with the Sanguine ELF Communication system must simultaneously satisfy a number of objectives. These objectives include: (1) providing a very low probability of incorrect message reception, (2) minimizing the required transmitter power by minimizing the required signal-to-noise ratio at a distant receiver, and (3) creating a signal that is difficult to spoof or jam. One suitable combination is the use of minimum shift keyed (MSK) modulation for bandspreading with binary convolutional encoding and antipodal channel symbol modulation. This signal structure in combination with sequential decoding at the receiver requires a bit-energy to effective noise-density ratio of less than 2 dB and hence is exceedingly efficient."
"The subset of ECCM techniques easily applicable to ELF communications is identified, and the problems of processing the transmission to simultaneously make jamming infeasible, desired reception feasible, and other systems undisrupted are briefly discussed. The quantitative levels of SANGUINE ECCM features planned for depends on cost-performance tradeoffs incorporating data and forecasts which are, and ought to be, classified; but general principles affecting the selection are sketched."
"The latest information on the capillary portion of the ocean wave spectrum confirms the growth of such spectral components with wind speed to high values. The numerous radar return theories all seem to indicate that the radar acts as a \"filter\" that causes the signal to respond to ocean wave components near the \"Bragg wavelength.\" Since these components are the ones that grow with wind speed, it is not surprising that observations of off-vertical radar backscatter indicate this growth in signal strength with wind speed. Analysis of NASA observations at 13.3 GHz and NRL observations at 8.9 GHz and 4.4 GHz demonstrate the strong response of the radar return at these frequencies to wind speed The RADSCAT concept of using a microwave radiometer to correct the radar signals for atmospheric attenuation in cloudy skies and to cross-check the radar when skies are clear is reviewed. Proposed experiments for SKYLAB flights during 1973 are discussed."
"This paper examines the influence of correlated wavefronts and directional noise (anisotropic background) on the performance of conventional and adaptive beamforming schemes used with linear arrays in the ocean environment."
"Experimental observations of sea wave power spectra, currents, wave directions, and growth of waves with fetch, made with a high-frequency, ground wave radar are outlined. Areas of expected development are discussed."
"In recent years several radar techniques have evolved which allow the remote measurement of certain parameters important in the description of sea state. At MF and HF, monostatic and bistatic configurations employing satellites, ships, islands, and/or land based stations can measure the ocean waveheight spectrum with several frequencies via first-order Bragg scatter. At high HF and VHF, the ocean waveheight spectrum can be estimated at a single carrier frequency via secord-order mechanisms; this technique is especially suited to remote sensing via long distance ionospheric propagation. At UHF, it is possible to measure the slope spectrum of the longer ocean waves via cross-correlation of simultaneous Bragg-effect returns at two frequencies. The short-pulse microwave satellite altimeter permits a direct measurement of the significant waveheight of the sea at the suborbital point via the specular point mechanism. Such techniques will be important both for detailed oceanographic study of ocean wave characteristics and for routine monitoring of sea state for maritime/meteorological purposes."
"The physical nature of the sea ice surface is discussed with respect to small-scale roughness. The dielectric properties of sea ice at 34 GHz are presented. Results of in situ reflectivity are presented. Interest in the Arctic Ocean in recent years has produced the need for new and better methods of transport through and over its ice cover. To facilitate routing of ice breakers and surface effect vehicles, better ice navigation systems and methods of determining ice surface topography are needed. One area of major emphasis is in the development of radar systems which produce an image of the ice surface, both for large area surveillance, as in the case of airborne side-looking radars, and for navigational radars carried by the vessels themselves. Because of the detail of the surface and the guidance information needed high degrees of resolution are desired, requiring the use of systems operating at frequencies in excess of 20 GHz. To aid in design of such systems, some fundamental information about sea ice as a millimeter wave reflector has been obtained."
"This paper describes a three phase program which was initiated to establish an estuarine pollution monitoring and prediction system. Priorities are assigned to all possible parameters, and the ten most vital are selected for measurement during Phase I. A complete description of the design and operation of the physical system is presented which constitutes the primary effort during Phase II. A multivariate prediction model is developed in Phase III, and its utilization is demonstrated on data collected by the monitoring system."
"A microwave radar capable of yielding spectral decompositions of large wave properties such as slope or orbital velocity is currently being built for installation over looking the Chesapeake Bay. The principle of this radar, the simple embodiment which is actually being built, and a description of the wave properties one might hope to measure with this radar are all discussed."

"Procedures utilized to determine oil pollution hazards from sunken world War II tankers are summarized briefly. The history of the investigations initiated by the government is examined, and conclusions drawn are discussed. Some proposed methods for improving inspection techniques and for debunkering sunken tankers are reviewed."
"The purpose of this study was to develop mathematical models which can be used to extend limited field data on water circulation and effluent dispersion. Two models were developed and tested; the \"Circulation Model\" and \"Effluent-Dispersion Model.\" The Circulation Model predicts the currents throughout a specified time and throughout a vertically well-mixed two-dimensional embayment from a knowledge of the tide heights or currents at the open boundaries of the embayment. The Effluent Dispersion Model predicts the concentration of wastes in space and time using the quantities of wastes discharged at the source locations and using the circulation currents in the embayment. For the case in which insufficient current data exists, the capability of using the two models in tandem (i.e. the outputs of the Circulation Model used directly as inputs to the Effluent Dispersion Model) was developed. Both models were applied to a pilot waterway, the West Passage of Narragansett Bay, to identify their operating characteristics and to demonstrate the veracity of their predictions. Results of these tests are presented, and demonstrate encouraging evidence that the models give accurate predictions."
"A nadir-viewing, visible spectrometer was flown over various ocean waters at altitudes from 500ft (0.15km) to 25,000 ft (7.6km). Data, presented in the form of spectral reflectivity, was obtained for a variety of water types and atmospheric conditions and correlated with chlorophyll and Secchi depth measurements obtained by boat. The spectral reflectivity measured was extrapolated, by use of standard atmosphere tables, to the top of the atmosphere. A range of spectral reflectivities that will be observed by satellite-borne ocean color sensors is presented. Results indicate the magnitude of the contrast to be expected from 400 to 700 nm and show that water color signatures can be obtained from satellite altitude."
"Aerial monitoring of sea surface temperatures using infrared radiometry is being conducted over Block Island Sound, eastern Long Island Sound, Narragansett Bay, and Thames River discharge zone on a weekly flight schedule. A cooperative ground truth data collection network has been generated among various area institutions to support the aerial measurements. The most promising aerial photographic remote sensing techniques currently being explored to detect and identify water borne pollutants are multispectral image acquisition and image enhancement interpretation. Attempts are being made to optimize film/filter combinations in the wavelength spectrum from 0.3 to 1.3 microns, corresponding to the characteristic reflective of absorptive wavelengths of various surface and sub-surface features. Aerial Coastal Oceanography and Pollution Surveillance."
"A model reference parameter adaptive control system is designed for a deep submergence vehicle (DSV) using Liapunov's direct method. This algorithm is applied to the nonlinear equations describing the two-dimensional motion of a DSV. The results of a digital computer simulation are presented which substantiate the theoretical predictions. A comparison is made between the parameter adaptive controller and an input signal controller previously reported, and significant advantages are noted."
"To the layman, it is often difficult to perceive how a spacecraft orbiting the earth at some 500 miles above the sea surface can be even moderately successful in analyzing conditions which, as many oceanographers will attest, are difficult to measure in situ. Remote sensing, however, offers a unique means for satisfaction of many important global oceanographic requirements. Further, new methodology developed as a result of initial ocean-dedicated spacecraft flights combined with instrumentation improvements will provide information even more profound than is now possible. This paper considers global oceanographic information requirements, corresponding measurements, associated spacecraft sensor/payload concepts and orbital requirements."
"A system for determining the position of a drifting buoy through use of the Navy Navigation Satellite is described. The system consists of a receiver that tracks satellites of the Navy Navigation Satellite System, a data link for transmission of the collected data to shore, and appropriate computer software. To aid the reader in understanding the concept, both the Navy Navigation System and the method of determining one's position through use of this system are described in some detail. The receiver, which is specifically designed for the buoy application, is described, and the computer software required for converting the data collected by the receiver to position data is briefly outlined."
"Range-range, bearing-bearing, range-and-bearing and three configurations of hyperbolic navigation system, for use at depths at which temperature fluctuations contribute significantly to errors in position fixing, are compared with regard to accuracy, shape of error distribution, ease of installation of fixed transponder/pinger array, and system complexity. The sensitivity of the systems to incorrect assessment of assumed parameters is presented. Range-and-bearing is shown to be superior on every count to its closest rival, range-range."
"The design of a free-floating portable system to obtain range and direction of an object striking the sea surface relative to the platform is described. The impact signals are received by hydrophones, processed to obtain time difference in signal arrivals, and telemetered to a shore station. Of special interest is the platform for the hydrophones which is comprised of a long slender spar, and cable suspended below it. Range measurement accuracy requires that two hydrophones be suspended vertically at known depths separated by fifty feet, and held vertical within two inches of each other in high sea states. Sea Tests indicate that this requirement has been met by the unique platform design."
"Approaches for portable deep water acoustic tracking systems are considered, and a best approach is recommended. Two proposed systems, a bottom mounted beacon system and a bottom mounted transponder system, are described."
"The U. S. Navy's fixed site underwater tracking ranges have provided very accurate facilities for the evaluation of new weapon systems, for the testing and calibration of existing systems, and for the evaluation of tactical exercises. Their greatest disadvantage, however, is their immobility and remoteness from some U. S. Naval fleet units. The Newport Laboratory of the U. S. Naval Underwater Systems Center has developed a Shallow Water Acoustic Tracking System (SWATS) to provide more flexibility in range operations. This system employs modified sonobuoys as telemetric underwater receivers and two trailer vans to house all land-based tracking equipment. The system concept, equipment and applications are described."
"We study the influence, on an acoustic propagating wave, of locally correlated sound velocity fluctuations possessing, in the large, a slowly varying non-uniform intensity. The effect of the medium on the multiple-scattered wave in the direction of \"on and off\" line of sight propagation is explicitly derived in terms of physical parameters. With the above results, we calculate the scattering properties of a turbulent and thermally inhomogeneous wake. The interest in acoustic waves propagating through random media is due to the importance of scatter propagation in communication or remote sensing, on the one hand, and the limitations imposed upon sonar tracking and guidance systems for undersea vehicles on the other."
"A physically motivated procedure is presented for evaluating the response of recursive digital filters via the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The key idea of the method is to employ a short string of artificial impulses as an alternative representation of the initial conditions implicit in processing a long excitation in segments. The method is computationally more efficient or of wider applicability than existing FFT techniques."
"The major proposals for the measurement of frequency variations are discussed. It is shown that the measurement of peak value offers considerable practical advantages over an rms measurement. A curve is shown of the subjective evaluation of flutter as a function of flutter frequency; this curve is a compromise between several proposals. These proposals have now been adopted nationally in Germany and the U.S.A., internationally by the International Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR), and are under consideration by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)."

"The old IEEE/ANSI flutter measurement standard did not predict subjective flutter; it also failed to specify several important characteristics of the meter. Comerci proposed a \"flutter index\" method but it was never adopted. Results of several workers were incorporated in 1962 in a German Standard (DIN) Weighted Peak Flutter measurement. The NAB flutter measurement of 1965 incorporates the frequency weighting of the DIN Standard, and the volume indicator of Comerci. CCIR adopted the DIN method in 1966. Experiments in the U.S.A. comparing the DIN and NAB methods showed the DIN method to be more satisfactory, and this method is incorporated in the new IEEE Standard 193-1971, based on an IEC draft. Circuits to achieve the desired time and frequency responses are given, as well as suppliers of commercial flutter meters and test records to the new standard."

"A method is described for realizing digital filters. It is shown that for annth-order function, 2ndistinct direct realizations are possible."
"The difficulty of numerical deconvolution is explained by examining the matrix of the linear equations generated by approximating the linear system superposition integral. It is shown that any row of the matrix is approximately a linear combination of other rows."
 "This correspondence gives a computer algorithm for determining theztransformF(z)of a given rational Laplace transformF(s). The procedure is based on the fact that thes-plane poles map one-to-one into thezplane, so the denominator ofF(z)can be easily determined. The numerator ofF(z)is determined by numerically inverting the Laplace transform at the sampling instants. One advantage of the procedure is that no extra computation is required ifF(s)has multiple poles."
"The concept of a randomly sampled digital filter is introduced and formulated in this paper. An equivalent problem, which is of utmost importance in digital filtering, is also considered, namely, the problem of digital filtering with faulty samplers. Error analysis is carried out in two different approaches: 1) frequency response method, and 2) worst-case analysis. With the confirmation of experimental verification, very simple formulas are derived that are applicable under different realistic assumptions, and are most appealing to practical design purposes."
"A method for very fast nonrecursive digital filtering is presented in which over three fourths of the coefficients of the filter impulse response are forced to be zero by the judicious choice of filter center frequency, bandwidth, and window. Nearly half of the remaining coefficients can be discarded by taking advantage of the symmetry of the impulse response, A technique is described for separating a signal into octave bands using the same set of coefficients for each filter operation provided that either the data is \"decimated\" or the impulse response is \"stretched\" prior to each pass. Timing comparisons show that this method is faster than Radix 2 FFT convolution using filters with up to 300 coefficients. For many applications, real-time filtering can be achieved by using fixed-point arithmetic and an impulse response having as few as seven nonzero values."
"A novel approach in synthesizing digital filters for signal processing applications is presented. This approach is an extension of the frequency sampling method of nonrecursive filter synthesis. Appropriate time delays are used in conjunction with a set of parallel complex exponential resonators whose outputs are summed to yield a desired filter impulse response. This synthesis method takes advantage of the known signal waveform structure and results in many fewer digital computations as compared to convolution processing. This approach is particularly suited to synthesis of matched filters for radar signal processing and yields matched or approximately matched filters which simultaneously have very low storage and very low computational requirements."
"Poor pitch control decreases the intelligibility of deaf speech. Small tactile pitch displays have the potential for supplying continuous corrective feedback for the improvement of the intonation patterns of deaf speakers. A simple pitch detector and tactile display proved effective in correcting a common intonation problem, indicating that work toward a wearable tactile aid is justified. A hypothesis is presented that explains the cause of the pitch problem and the success of the experimental system in terms of the need of the deaf speaker for voicing and frequency referents."
"Digital signal processing techniques are becoming increasingly important in speech analysis and synthesis. These techniques can be implemented using a general purpose computer facility (often not in real time), or special purpose hardware realizations can be constructed. This paper discusses some recent work in speech processing including design of digital filter bank spectrum analyzers, homorphic analyzers of speech, predictive coding, and hardware realization of a digital formant synthesizer. The survey concentrates on those speech processing techniques relevant to the development of sensory aids for the deaf."
"The principal results of this paper are listed as follows. 1) The eigenvalues of a suitably normalized version of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) are{1, -1,j, -j}. 2) An eigenvector basis is constructed for the DFT. 3) The multiplicities of the eigenvalues are summarized for an N×N transform as follows."
"Recent developments of prototype speech-processing aids intended to present speech information to persons with severe losses of hearing are summarized. The major types of devices are described, including those for speech reception and for speech training, and those that employ displays that are visual, factual, or auditory."
"A digital data processor is mechanized using a given technology operating near its maximum speed. In order to digitally modulate this signal, the sampling rate of the information channel is increased and the data are smoothed by passing them through an interpolation filter. The faster sampling rate and higher speed interpolation filter appear to demand a change to a higher speed technology. This correspondence demonstrates that the slower technology can be carried through the interpolation filter stage."
"An expression for the discrete Hilbert transform (DHT) is given for the case of an odd number of points."
"An analysis of the Fourier transform for a truncated cosine waveform is given that illustrates the dependence of the transform on the phase as the period of the waveform becomes large with respect to the record length. The effects of sampling on the transform are then discussed and illustrated."
"A new stroboelectric tuner for musical instruments is claimed to be simpler to construct and to use than devices so far described. A single strobo disk rotates at a very constant speed. It is marked out in 12 concentric tracks, each representing a semitone of the musical scale. Each track is divided up into a number of equal divisions such that the ratios of the number of divisions from track to track are almost equal to the ratios of frequencies of successive semitones of the equal tempered scale. The rotating disk is illuminated by a pulse-fed neon lamp. The incoming sound wave is amplified, passes through a zero crossing detector, is then differentiated; the resulting pulses are amplified and fed the neon lamps via a step-up transformer. The lamp thus emits short-duration flashes at the fundamental frequency of the incoming sound wave. When this frequency is any submultiple of one of the track frequencies, the divisions in that track appear stationary. Due to the pulsed illumination these divisions appear perfectly crisp at all frequencies. Sharp or flat misintonation causes the divisions to appear to move clockwise or anticlockwise. No switching or other manual action is required when moving from semitone to semitone, nor from octave to octave. A maximum error of less than 1 cent can be achieved."
"The purpose of this correspondence is to correct some inaccuracies in the above paper. Specifically, we refer to the results in the Section \"Linear Phase Type 2 Filters\" (pp. 205-207). Although the results of that section are correct for the conditions stated, the constraints on phase delay andH_{(N-1)/2}are more restrictive than necessary. Therefore, we offer the following as a correction to the original section."
"A visual display was designed which supplements features of speech generally not perceived by individuals with severe hearing losses above 500 Hz. With the audio speech signal and visual feature information presented simultaneously, severely hard of hearing individuals correctly identified 78 percent of the items on CV syllable lists and 75 percent of the items on CVC word lists. Without the supplemental visual information, the individuals could correctly identify only 35 percent of the CV syllables and 40 percent of CVC words through auditory perception. Implications of this work for future aids for the deaf are discussed."
 "The development of speech-training aids for the deaf requires an understanding of how the acoustic characteristics of deaf speech differ from those of normal speech. The analysis of deaf speech presents problems in that formants may be closely spaced relative to their bandwidths, or unusual variations in voicing may make the separation of source and vocaltract characteristics more difficult than for normal speech. The fundamental frequency contours of deaf children exhibit unusual characteristics, and a second major problem of interest is the quantitative specification of these contours and how they differ from those of normal children. Two digital-processing techniques which are well suited for these problems are the chirp z transform and the short-term orthogonal polynomial analysis. Application of these techniques in the acoustic analysis of the speech of deaf children is discussed."
 "Three displays were evaluated for their effectiveness in overcoming pronunciation problems that typically confront Spanish speakers attempting to learn English. One display shows tongue location and trajectory during vowels; another similar display isolates the vowels in multisyllabic words that should be reduced; the third display shows the amount of aspiration of initial consonants and the time lapse before voicing of the succeeding vowel. Other displays are being developed for teaching a tone language to English speakers."

"The problem of maximally flat delay design of recursive digital filters has been solved by Thiran, using a direct z-domain approach. In this paper, the solution is obtained in a much simpler way by making use of the familiar bilinear transform s of the variable z. A suitable continued fraction expansion available in the mathematical literature is shown to lead immediately to the required solution. The approach corresponds to the one used by Abele in transmission line filter design."
"A procedure utilizing linear threshold techniques for segmenting utterances of a single known phrase has been implemented. The technique utilizes several weight vectors derived in an iterative manner and temporal information between various designated speech events to perform segmentation. Accuracy results ranging from 100 to 92 percent have been achieved on nondesign data and are considered to be encouraging. Some remarks are included concerning means for strengthening these techniques and for applying them to other areas."
"Continuous automatic recordings of the directivity patterns at various frequencies have been obtained for loudspeakers and microphones placed in a reverberant enclosure. Tone bursts and electronic gating have been used to simulate free-field conditions. This method appears to give results as accurate as those obtained in an anechoic chamber. The lowest measurement frequency of the directivity pattern is determined by the size of the enclosure available."
"Two-dimensional recursive filters are conveniently described in terms of two-dimensional z transforms. The designer of these filters faces two fundamental problems, their stability and their synthesis. Stability is determined by the location of the zero-valued region of the filter's denominator polynomial. A conjecture based on a one-dimensional stability theorem leads to a useful empirical stabilization procedure. Two-dimensional recursive filters can be synthesized to approximate large varieties of desired two-dimensional pulse responses. A conformal transformation yields two-dimensional recursive bandpass filters from appropriately specified one-dimensional filters."
"Effects of introducing single or multiple pairs of coincidentj\\omegaaxis zeros in all-pole Chebyshev filter transfer functions are investigated. It is shown that for the same ordern, Chebyshev filters with finitej\\omegaaxis zeros provide much sharper cutoff than all-pole Chebyshev filters. It is also shown that for the samen, the same number of pairs of zerosm, and the same locations of zeros, the cutoff slope and stopband characteristic of the finite zero Chebyshev filters are much better than those of the finite zero Butterworth filters. Graphs helpful in the design of such filters have been plotted and their use is illustrated by an example."
"A time-domain method is presented for designing nonrecursive digital filters that are optimum in the sense that the output samples are least mean-square estimates of the samples of some desired signal. The method requires that one know the input autocorrelation function and the cross-correlation function between the input and the desired output. Several examples are given of filters designed by the method. The optimum filters can be obtained by sampling the impulse responses of optimum filters for continuous reconstruction of the waveforms from their samples."
"A low-noise FET input amplifier is described, which has been designed to be used in all physical measurements where high internal resistance sources are employed and exceptional noise performances of the amplifier, from a few hertz to some hundred kilohertz, are required. The noise figure of the amplifier is less than 0.5 dB at 10 Hz for source resistances ranging from 30 kΩ to 10 MΩ. The midband input noise voltage spectral density is 2.2 nV/(Hz)\\frac{1}{2}and rises to 7.3 nV/(Hz)\\frac{1}{2}at 10 Hz with a lower corner frequency of 2 kHz. The amplifier is stabilized against variations in supply voltage and temperature. A short analysis of the general noise characteristics of transistor linear amplifiers precedes the description of the low-noise amplifier."
"At the helm of G-AE publications since 1965, Mr. Frederick Van Veen, of Teradyne, Inc., Boston, Mass., recently requested to be relieved of his duties as Editor-in-Chief because of increasingly conflicting demands being placed on his time. We owe him a great debt of gratitude for his invaluable contributions toward revitalizing the Group's TRANSACTIONS. Under his leadership, the TRANSACTIONS pages published annually increased over 250%. This growth has not been at the expense of quality; on the contrary, the Group has published many truly significant papers and has become a forum for reports of new work in the exciting field of digital signal processing. Evidence of this fact is the run on some special issues, especially those devoted to digital signal processing. Incidentally, an anthology of the best papers on digital signal processing, currently in preparation, will rely largely on papers published in the G-AE TRANSACTIONS. Owing in no small part to Mr. VanVeen's organizational talents, the TRANSACTIONS now receives a steady supply of high-quality papers. But this makes it more difficult to schedule special issues without holding up publication of accepted papers. In view of the importance of special issues, then, the Group is moving in the direction of changing the publication schedule from quarterly to bimonthly. Dedicating the additional issues to special topics will, in effect, allow us to meet the demands for special issues without lengthening the interval between regular issues. We expect that this scheduling change will help us serve our membership better. The turnaround of the TRANSACTIONS is based on the relentless effort of a dedicated few, of which Mr. VanVeen has been a key member. On behalf of the Group on Audio and Electroacoustics, I want to express my sincere appreciation for all of his accomplishments in carrying out the demanding task of Editor-in-Chief. We welcome Mr. William E. Collins, of General Radio Company, Concord, Mass., who has assumed the post of Editor-in-Chief."
"The general Remes exchange algorithm and its implementation are discussed briefly An analog of the exchange algorithm is applied to the problem in which upper and lower constraints are imposed on the frequency response of a nonrecursive digital filter with linear phase. A typical design example is presented with rather tight constraints in the passband"
"We discuss some aspects of the stability problem in two-dimensional recursive filtering. In particular, we derive a simplified version of a stability theorem due to Shanks and show that it is equivalent to some results of Ansell. We also give several examples of stability tests and pose a few unsolved problems."

"We present an upper bound on the rms value of self-sustained limit cycles in fixed-point implementations of digital filters. The bound can be easily evaluated for the important special case of sections of order two, and simulation results for this case show that the bound is a useful tool."
"A new algorithm, based upon a digital inverse filter formulation, is presented and shown to be quite useful for estimating resonance or formant structure of voiced speech. The output of the algorithm is a set of raw data corresponding to peak frequencies versus time which is then used to estimate the first three and sometimes four continuously varying formant trajectories. Although an algorithm for automatically extracting the formants from the raw data is not presented here, for nearly 90 percent of the time an automatic decision algorithm is trivial, namely, the first three peaks of the reciprocal of the inverse filter spectrum define the first three formants."
"An FFT algorithm is presented that can be implemented with serial-access memory. For clarity and insight the emphasis is upon conciseness and illustration rather than shorthand mathematical notation. The algorithm's potential for high-speed implementation is demonstrated by studying variations on the basic algorithm that include both higher radix algorithms and parallel arithmetic unit algorithms. The fact that these sophisticated variations can be seen and understood by inspection of the basic algorithm emphasizes its simplicity. The algorithm is shown very suitable for efficient special-purpose implementation by the functional independence of the transform node from the particular node in the transform or the number of nodes in the transform, i.e., one node in canonical form (for a given radix) represents the entire FFT algorithm. The algorithm is shown to perform variable length transforms at full operational efficiency with minor modification, thus emphasizing its relative versatility. The possibly unexpected conclusion is made that the FFT implementation using parallel arithmetic units is more efficient in terms of speed and probably design effort and hardware, than one using high radix algorithms."

"The z transform of the truncated impulse response of a digital filter with poles is a polynomial that is important in the stability analysis of certain types of block and inverse digital filters. The geometry of partial sums is the theory that describes the behavior of the zeros of these polynomials. This paper presents specific results and also develops guidelines for use in stability analysis and design of block and inverse digital filters."
"As an alternative to conventional electromechanical loudspeakers, an attempt is made to utilize an electrothermal process for sound reproduction. A brief history of gaseous loudspeakers is presented, with emphasis on the discovery of the sound-generating ability of a seeded gas flame modulated by an electrical audio input. The theory and basic design requirements are discussed for a horn-type loudspeaker in which the flame is enclosed in a cylindrical tube. Two such experimental loudspeakers, one constructed for public address applications and the other for high-frequency reproduction, are described. A complete evaluation of these loudspeakers, including frequency response, signal-to-noise ratio, durability, and feasibility, is also carried out."

"It has been shown that the frequency sampling technique for the design of nonrecursive digital filters in conjunction with a search for optimum transition band samples yields good digital filter designs. It is shown that the frequency sampling technique is directly related to the Fourier series design and modifications are proposed for simplifying the design procedure."
"A convenient mathematical formulation is given for the absolute low-frequency response of an electrodynamic direct radiator loudspeaker mounted in a vented or unvented enclosure. The combined effects of speakerQ(ratio of reactance to resistance), enclosure size, and enclosure tuning are shown to control the convergence of the response curve towards its asymptotic value. Mathematical criteria are presented graphically, which enable the designer to find enclosure characteristics that give a frequency response curve flat through fourth order in reciprocal frequency, for a given loudspeakerQ. In addition, it is shown that forQ = 0.383the system can be made flat through sixth order by choosing the correct enclosure size and vent tuning. This \"triple point\" design represents the flattest possible response for direct radiator systems."
"Canonic realizations of a digital transfer function using the continued fraction expansion techniques are derived. Realizability conditions of each realization are provided along with illustrative examples."
"The cost of a digital filter, if implemented as a special-purpose computer, depends heavily on the word length of the coefficients. Therefore, it should be reduced as much as possible. On the other hand, a small word length causes large coefficient deviations that impair the wanted performance of the digital filter. The necessary word length may be reduced by choosing a suitable structure for the filter. Two methods for doing this will be presented, taking selective filters as a model. A further reduction of the word length may be won by optimizing the rounded filter coefficients in the discrete parameter space. A description of a modified univariate search will be given."
"A method is described that yields the fast Walsh transform (FWT) in sequency order. The advantages of this method over others are: 1) it is based on the Cooley-Tukey-type fast Hadamard transform (FHT) algorithm, 2) the computational effort is identical to the conventional FHT, and 3) the transform remains its own inverse."
"The concept of multirate digital filtering is introduced here. Two specific schemes are under scrutiny, one consisting of a digital prefilter and the other consisting of an analog prefilter."
  "This paper presents an algorithm that can be used to design finite impulse response (FIR) digital filters with linear phase. The presentation is in the form of a block diagram together with the Fortran IV listing of the program."
"A function defined on a finite interval may be expressed as the sum of two functions, one of odd and one of even symmetry in the interval. These two functions as defined on the half-interval may each in turn be expressed as the sum of two functions, and so on. Such analysis is called symmetry analysis. For sampled functions, if the number of samples under analysis is a power of 2, symmetry analysis is identical with Walsh analysis. Characteristic basis vectors for all orders of symmetry analysis are derived."
"Research in fields such as communication, speech, oceanography, seismic exploration, economics, and biomedical data processing is often directed toward the analysis of nonstationary or transient data. Complex demodulation is shown to be a valuable method that can be used to decompose a composite signal composed of differing transient wavelets and to estimate spectra. For the latter application it is shown that several other techniques recently advanced in the literature are special cases of complex demodulation. The algorithm discussed can achieve the decomposition of a certain class of noisy composite signals composed of nonidentical unknown multiple wavelets overlapping in time, namely those signals with reasonably well-defined independent resonances in the spectrum. The decomposition estimates the arrival time, peak, envelope, and frequency of the damped oscillatory transient wavelet. The procedure has been tested extensively and several selected experimental results are tendered. It has been found that for wavelets of the typet^{k}e^{-at} \\sin (\\omegat),k =0, 1, that an uncertainty relationship for the product of the 3-dB bandwidth and the time duration of the wavelet must be satisfied. An error analysis has established a relationship between envelope-and phase-estimation errors to wavelet and filter parameters. The results obtained via complex demodulation are discussed relative to those obtained via inverse filtering, the complex cepstrum, and the chirp z transform."
"A special-purpose computer is organized to realize a second-order digital filter in a choice of 11 programming forms. Instructions for the forms are stored in a fast-access READ-ONLY memory. Also, a hard-wired multiplier is employed in the Arithmetic Unit to decrease computation time. The multiplier is organized into uniform functional blocks that are suitable for large-scale integration (LSI). A computer-aided design (CAD) program may be used to select the best filter programming form for a given filter transfer functionD(z). The CAD program also aids in the location of the binary point in the data registers of the computer."

"The purpose of this correspondence is to point out that the all-pole model is closely related to the theory of polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle, that it is theoretically strictly stable, and that the recursive computation scheme of Levinson follows directly from the theory of orthogonal polynomials."
"Different forms of block recursive digital filters are formulated using a matrix representation of convolution. These approaches have the same relation to recursive filters that fast convolution does to nonrecursive filters. The multiplication efficiencies are calculated and compared, showing that the block realization can become more efficient for filters with orders exceeding approximately 25. The general improvements on stability and sensitivity to roundoff error and coefficient accuracy are discussed."
"Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in the implementation of digital filter structures with low-coefficient word length. A conjecture has been made by Fettweis that if digital filter structures are modeled after analog ladder structures, which are known to have desirable coefficient sensitivity properties, then the digital ladder structures will also have these properties and could be implemented with low-coefficient word lengths. To investigate this conjecture, a seventh-order Chebyshev low-pass filter was realized as a digital ladder structure and the coefficient sensitivity was analyzed experimentally under coefficient rounding in floating-point representation. To serve as a comparison similar examples of cascade structures of direct and coupled form sections were also analyzed in the same manner. The conclusions drawn are that, indeed, the digital ladder structures in many cases can be implemented with lower coefficient word lengths than the conventional structures."
 "A digital random number generator that generates number sequences with either uniform or Gaussian distributions has been constructed in TTL digital hardware for use as a peripheral device to a DDP-516 computer. The hardware design is based on an algorithm described by Rader, Rabiner, and Schafer [1]. Approximations to the Gaussian distribution are generated by summingNA + 1consecutive numbers from the uniform sequence, whereNA(the number of additions) is specified by the user and is in the range0 \\leq NA \\leq 213. Measurements of its autocorrelation function, power spectrum, and amplitude histograms indicate that the generator produces uncorrelated samples with amplitude distributions that are very close to the desired uniform or Gaussian distributions. For generating Gaussian numbers, the hardware generator operates at least 600 times faster than an equivalent software realization."
"This paper is concerned with the class of Markov chains with circulant transition matrices. We show that such chains generate random processes whose spectral densities are of a particularly simple form, and that they provide a partial solution to the problem of synthesizing Markov chains that generate processes with given spectral densities."
"The problem of designing a stable recursive digital filter to have an arbitrarily prescribed frequency response may be considered as an approximation problem. Using the minimump- error criterion, a new problem of minimizing a function ofnvariables results, which is successfully solved using the Fletcher-Powell algorithm. An important theorem guaranteeing the existence of a stable optimum for a large class of synthesis problems is stated, and necessary modifications to the Fletcher-Powell algorithm to assure stability are considered. Finally a number of results of the application of this method are given."
"FFT processing systems have become important and extremely useful implementations of narrow-band signal detectors for signals with unknown phase and frequency. This paper examines the Fourier filter and detector and shows it to be an optimum receiver for a very generalized signal model. The general signal model covers a single sinusoidal pulse, pulse trains, and continuous signals. The model provides for the finite bandwidth encountered in real signals and includes the affect of redundant processing which can be employed with high-speed FFT processors. The paper provides a method for evaluating detection sensitivity for this class of signal detectors and gives experimental results from an FFT processor implementation."
"The Walsh power spectrum of a sequence of random samples is defined as the Walsh transform of the logical autocorrelation function of the random sequence. The \"logical\" autocorrelation function is defined in a similar form as the \"arithmetic\" autocorrelation function. The Fourier power spectrum, which is defined as the Fourier transform of the arithmetic autocorrelation function, can be obtained from the Walsh power spectrum by a linear transformation. The recursive relations between the logical and arithmetic auto-correlation functions are derived in this paper. For a given process with computed or modeled autocorrelation function the Fourier and Walsh power spectra are computed by using the fast Fourier and Walsh transforms, respectively. Examples are given from the speech and imagery data."
"The use of optimization techniques for designing digital filters has become widespread in recent years. Among the techniques that have been used include steepest descent methods, conjugate gradient techniques, penalty function techniques, and polynomial interpolation procedures. The theory of linear programming offers many advantages for designing digital filters. The programs are easy to implement and yield solutions that are guaranteed to converge. There are many areas of finite impulse response (FIR) filter design where linear programming can be used conveniently. These include design of the following: filters of the frequency sampling type; optimal filters where the passband and stopband edge frequencies of the filter may be specified exactly; and filters with simultaneous constraints on the time and frequency response. The design method is illustrated by examples from each of these areas."
"The design of bandwidth-limiting filters for the purpose of sample-rate reduction is considered. Realization of linear-phase finite-duration impulse-response (FIR) filters for this application by direct convolution is shown to be more efficient than the recursive realization [1]. The degree to which the Nyquist rate (relative to the desired signal bandwidth) must be exceeded at the filter output in order to avoid aliasing is suggested as a measure of filter effectiveness. Direct convolution is faster than the fast convolution for FIR equiripple [2] filters designed to operate within 10 percent of the Nyquist rate with 60- to 70-dB stopband attenuation at a 2:1 sample-rate reduction. This advantage improves with the log of the sample-rate reduction ratio. Several comparisons made with recursive realizations of elliptic filters give the advantage to direct convolutional realization of FIR filters for sampling within about 20 percent of the Nyquist rate at 60- to 70-dB attenuation. Elliptic filters become more efficient at higher complexities (of about eight poles and eight zeros). Two design techniques that exploit the reduced output sample rate in the design of FIR filters by direct convolution are suggested. The effects of quantization of FIR filter coefficients on the frequency response are considered and several examples illustrated."

"Features of an optimal digital ladder structure are analyzed in an example. Comparisons are made with a suboptimal digital ladder structure and a cascade structure."
"The theory for designing finite-duration impulse response (FIR) digital filters can readily be extended to two or more dimensions. Using linear programming techniques, both frequency sampling and optimal (in the sense of Chebyshev approximation over closed compact sets) two-dimensional filters have been successfully designed. Computational considerations have limited the filter impulse response durations (in samples) to 25 by 25 in the frequency sampling case, and to 9 by 9 in the optimal design case. However, within these restrictions, a large number of filters have been investigated. Several of the issues involved in designing two-dimensional digital filters are discussed."
"Maximally flat (MF) low-pass filters of ordernwith exactlyn, orn - 1finite zeros are investigated and are compared with the same order Butterworth filter, i.e., the MF filter with no finite zeros. It is seen that the MF filter with finite imaginary zeros exhibits sharper cutoff at the edge of the passband and ripple in the stopband. It is shown that the MF filter that maximizes the magnitude of the slope at cutoff is characterized by equal ripple in the stopband. This filter is shown to be the Inverse Chebyshev. Expressions for cutoff slope and for transition bandwidth are derived and are compared with those of the Butterworth filter. The step responses of the Inverse Chebyshev and of the Butterworth are also compared."
"In the analysis of nonpercussive musical transients the use of expanded periodic techniques yields results that are easily understood, readily correlated with subjective response, and in the format of the technical description of periodic musical sounds. They do, however, lack the rigor of transform techniques when applied to changing sounds. This paper examines the possible errors in approximating almost-periodic sounds by periodic waveforms one period at a time, and defines the limitations on the application of the method to musical transients. It appears there is a very large class of musical sounds to which the method can be applied successfully."

 "The committee on Digital Signal Processing of the IEEE Group on Audio and Electroacoustics has undertaken the project of recommending terminology for use in papers and texts on digital signal processing. The reasons for this project are twofold. First, the meanings of many terms that are commonly used differ from one author to another. Second, there are many terms that one would like to have defined for which no standard term currently exists. It is the purpose of this paper to propose terminology which we feel is self-consistent, and which is in reasonably good agreement with current practices. An alphabetic index of terms is included at the end of the paper."
"A new algorithm is presented for calculating the real discrete Fourier transform of a real-valued input series with even symmetry. The algorithm is based on the fast Fourier transform algorithm for arbitrary real-valued input series (FTRVI) [1], [2]. By eliminating all unnecessary steps and storage locations, and by rearranging the intermediate results and the operation sequence, it is possible to reduce the computation time and the required core storage by a factor of 2 as compared to the case of arbitrary real input or by a factor of 4 as compared to the general fast Fourier transform for complex inputs."
"A system for synthesizing speech is described. It consists of an electronic synthesizer controlled by a small digital computer. The computer uses stored rules to convert a phonetic input into the analogue voltages required for driving the synthesizer. It has been found possible to make the system operate in real time so that the acoustic output is generated at normal speaking rates."
"A random search optimization algorithm for integer-valued functions is proposed. The application of the algorithm to the design of digital filters with finite word length is presented."
"A Fortran language computer program is described that evaluates the absolute low-frequency response and electrical impedance functions of frequency for direct radiator electrodynamic loudspeakers mounted in vented, unvented, or infinite baffle enclosures. The program is intended to be used interactively, with the engineer serving to suggest modifications of a design and the program providing the modified response plots. The program listing, typical input data, and an example of the program's output are shown."
"In this paper a new method for estimating F0, the fundamental frequency of voiced speech versus time, is presented. The algorithm is based upon a simplified version of a general technique for fundamental frequency extraction using digital inverse filtering. It is demonstrated that the simplified inverse filter tracking algorithm (hereafter referred to as the SIFT algorithm) encompasses the desirable properties of both autocorrelation and cepstral pitch analysis techniques. In addition, the SIFT algorithm is composed of only a relatively small number of elementary arithmetic operations. In machine language, SIFT should run in several times real time while with special-purpose hardware it could easily be realized in real time."
"Using piecewise-periodic techniques, the attack transients of almost 200 different organ pipes from 33 ranks have been analyzed. Results for 44 pipes representing 10 ranks are discussed in detail in this paper. In addition to the steady-state parameters of frequency and amplitude, transient duration, overshoot, delay and stability are used to describe the attack transients, and it is shown how each pipe, rank, and family differs from the others in these respects. Norms for the four families, flutes, foundations, strings, and reeds, are proposed. Recognizing the importance of attack transients in characterizing musical sounds, these results provide a unique aid in the design of instruments, traditional or electronic, that generate pipe organ sounds. The technique of piecewise-periodic analysis can, in addition, be used on many other musical instruments and synthesizers as an aid in their design, manufacture, and operation."
"This paper describes an investigation of the low-frequency performance of an electrodynamic direct radiator loudspeaker mounted in a vented or an unvented enclosure. The goal of the investigation is to determine if the maximally flat system (see Thiele [1] or Lea and Lampton [2]) can be improved by permitting small uniformly bounded departures from flat response. A figure of merit is defined that permits systems of different types to be compared. A class of bounded-ripple loudspeaker systems is discussed; these systems have figures of merit at least as good as that of the triple point system. The numerical results of the investigation are presented graphically. A procedure is described with which maximally flat or bounded-ripple systems satisfying given performance specifications may be designed."
"Butterworth low-pass filters implemented on fixed-point computers can become useless for small passband designs because of underflow or overflow caused by the size of the nonrecursive terms. Curves are provided that show where the filters become unusable for various computer word lengths as a function of bandwidth and the size of the nonrecursive coefficient."
"An active RC all-pass network has been proposed in which the regulation of only one component allows independent adjustment of each parameter affecting the phase characteristic. This flexibility is very suitable for time-delay equalization. Its use in maximally flat time-delay lines is shown, and tables of normalized components are provided to simplify the design work."

"The application of computer techniques to difficult large-scale network problems is discussed. The physical characteristics of two types of systems are described--computer-communication networks and cable television distribution systems. Two fundamental algorithms are presented, and applications to routing, reliability, and design of computer networks are given. The detailed engineering decisions that can be made by computer in the design of practical large-scale networks are illustrated by example for cable television systems. These examples are chosen to indicate the richness and difficulty of the problem of applying computers to network design."
"Some of the recent developments in the automated design and analysis of digital systems are reviewed. Two new areas alluded to are centralized data base systems for design automation and interactive graphic computer-aided design. The areas of gate level simulation, synthesis, partitioning, interconnection, and fault test generation are dealt with in more detail. New algorithms in each of these areas are presented and compared, and a few important unsolved problems are mentioned. Some of the systems, techniques, and/or algorithms discussed are: A. Gate level simulation; 1) fault list propagation, 2) three-valued simulation. B. Synthesis; 1) register transfer level, 2) logic gate level. C. Partitioning; 1) clustering algorithms, 2) functional partitioning via simulation. D. Interconnect; 1) path seeking algorithms, 2) Steiner's problem. E. Fault test generation; 1) D algorithm, 2) Boolean difference, 3) equivalent normal form, 4) extensions to sequential circuits."
"A system of design automation computer programs is described which is capable of assigning blocks of a logic design to modules so as to satisfy certain constraints specified on the assignment. System features which enable designer-computer cooperation are discussed, and quality of solutions obtained with the system are compared to manual solutions for the same tasks. Three conclusions are reached. First, these computer programs make it possible to perform partitioning and mapping experiments which were not possible before. Second, for one-level partitions (e.g., logic gates on chips), highly automatic solutions obtained by the system are at least as good as manual solutions and are less costly to obtain. Third, for multilevel partitions (e.g., logic gates on chips on cards) or for mappings, the solutions obtained with the program are again at least as good as manual solutions; furthermore, the system allows a designer to try more alternatives than he could manually, so that he can trade off the time and cost of trying additional alternatives against the value of a better solution."
"Recently a number of interactive graphics aids to integrated circuit mask layout have been described. A review of the particular problems involved in implementing programs of this kind will be given with a description of hardware and software techniques available for their solution. Some features of these previously described programs will be compared and used to illustrate the range of solutions available. A program, IMP, will be described that uses some software techniques, not previously employed, to provide a capable and highly flexible mask layout facility on relatively inexpensive graphics terminals."
"CIRCAL-2 is a second-generation general-purpose on-line circuit-design program with the following main features: 1) multiple-analysis capability; 2) uniform and general data structures for handling text editing, network representations, and output results, regardless of analysis; 3) special techniques and structures for minimizing and controlling user-program interaction; 4) use of functionals for the description of hysteresis and heat effects; and 5) ability to define optimization procedures that \"replace\" the user. The paper discusses the organization of CIRCAL-2, the aforementioned main features, and their consequences, such as a set of network elements and models general enough for most analyses and a set of functions tailored to circuit-design requirements. The presentation is descriptive, concentrating on conceptual rather than on program implementation details."
"A scheme is presented for describing the interconnection of elements and subnetworks into networks by means of \"wiring operators.\" This scheme is algebraic and is intended for conversing with computers. It is especially suitable for two-parts such as amplifiers, filters, microwave networks, and in general, transmission-type networks with an input and an output. The algebra is direct, convenient, and versatile. Each of the wiring operators corresponds to a specific set of calculations on the parameters of the networks involved."
"The complete problem, to minimize the operating cost of a hydrothermal generation system over one day (or one week) is formulated and solved through a few assumptions: the dc approximation and a linear law for the fuel costs, primarily the methods used mix the combinatorial and the electrical features of the problem. New methods employed are a branch and bound method for the thermal unit commitment, a gradient method to set the hydropower, and an economic dispatch routine with active flow constraints."
"Since the development of sparsity techniques by Tinney, the power-flow program has become an extremely effective and often used tool for planning electric power networks. This program solves for the unknowns--voltages, phase angles, etc.--of a set of simultaneous nonlinear algebraic equations, the ac power-flow equations. The optimum power flow is likely to replace, in due time, the normal power flow in many important planning functions discussed in this paper. A number of mathematical programming techniques have recently been studied to solve the optimum power flow and several small-to-medium sized experimental programs have been written. The generalized reduced gradient (GRG), one of the most elegant nonlinear-programming techniques, is described and it is shown how it can be extended to solve optimum power flows of very high dimension (of the order of several thousand nodes). This extension consists mainly of using sparsity techniques in several of the solution steps of the GRG."
"A hybrid computer system with electronic patching at the University of Michigan Simulation Center is described. The system allows automatic digital setup of problems on the analog subsystem within 20 ms. This fast turnaround permits time sharing of the hybrid computer using remote terminals. In addition to generating high-speed solutions to non-linear differential equations, the hybrid system also generates alphanumeric and graphic displays for use at each terminal. A high-level compiler using simulation-language statements to program automatically the analog subsystem is decribed, along with an example problem. The authors feel that this time-shared hybrid system, which provides two to three orders of magnitude speed advantage in access time and solution time when compared with digital terminal systems, offers a new dimension to computer-aided design of dynamic systems."
"The role of characterization and modeling is a vital one in bringing computers progressively into tighter loops in the design cycle. While a coordinated characterization effort provides the backbone of computation, it can also become an end in itself; it provides a bridge between several disciplines, particularly device development, circuit design, and computer analysis. Complete characterization includes several activities; selecting mathematical models for devices; developing measurement techniques, and measurement jigs; and devising statistical representations to account for manufacturing variability, environmental changes, and aging effects. Such a characterization effort with details of recent advances in bi-polar transistor modeling is outlined. In addition to tying together computer ac, dc, and transient analysis capability, the modeling approach allows investigation of \"real world\" effects such as manufacturing variability, temperature changes, and aging effects. This is an essential prerequisite for valid design studies."
"A new program for one-dimensional semiconductor device analysis is described and shown to be more general and more efficient than competitive methods. Numerical results from a study of high-frequency bipolar transistors are given with emphasis on the effect of Fermi statistics and velocity limitation in high-current density situations. A method for device modeling directly from the partial differential equation (PDE) solutions is described, and applied to the problem of simulating the performance of high-speed emitter-coupled logic circuits."
"The backward differentiation formulas (BDF), of order 1 up to 6 are described as they are applied to a system of differential algebraic equations. The BDF method is compared to the Gear-Nordsieck method, and is shown to be more efficient, more flexible in the selection of variables for prediction and error control, and more stable under conditions of rapidly varying Δt. For Δt fixed, the two methods are equivalent but for Δt varying they are not equivalent. Numerical experiments are described which demonstrate that the Gear-Nordsieck and BDF methods are unstable under rapidly changing Δt, but BDF is more stable. The two methods are distinguished numerically by identifying the modification of the Gear-Nordsieck method which makes it equivalent to the BDF method even if Δt changes. The computational advantage of using backward differences Δx, instead of the Nordsieck vector, for storing the backward-time information is treated by giving an operations count which shows the BDF using backward Δx's is more efficient. Finally, additional numerical evidence is given to support the use of variable order methods and the use of higher order methods."
"In the computer-aided analysis of nonlinear circuits with periodic inputs and a stable periodic response the steady-state periodic response is found for a given initial state by simply integrating the system equations until the response becomes periodic. In lightly damped systems this integration could extend over many periods making the computation costly. In this paper a Newton algorithm is defined which converges to the steady-state response rapidly. The algorithm is applied to several nonlinear circuits. The results show a considerable reduction in the amount of time necessary to compute the steady-state response. In addition, the initial iterates give information on the transient response of the system."
"The synthesis of space charge free electron lenses can be approached by first assuming solutions for Laplace's partial differential equation in terms of cylindrical harmonics. The hybrid computer can quickly generate these assumed solutions and their gradient by working with the differential equations obtained from product separation of variables. The gradient is used in the integration for the trajectory to determine if the lens is useful. If so, either equipotential surfaces or the potentials along a desired surface are generated with the computer to guide the physical realization of the lens. Certain cases where space charge cannot be neglected are solved by truncation of rectilinear electron flow. Poisson's equation is solved in the computer to serve as a Cauchy boundary condition to Laplace's equation outside the electron beam. The hybrid computing technique and the experimental verification of some of the results in cathode-ray tube electron lenses are presented."

"Microstrip transmission lines used in microwave integrated circuits are dispersive. The dispersion of the lines is fully characterized by the frequency-dependent normalized phase velocity VP which is equal to the ratio of guide wavelength λgto free-space wavelength λ0. An approximate equation is given for the normalized phase velocity VP and for the frequency-dependent line impedance Z for standard microstrip transmission lines. Comparison with available experimental data and computed data shows that the error of the approximation is less than 3 percent for microstrip transmission lines commonly used in engineering applications."
"A method is presented for analyzing the effets of quantization of coefficients on the frequency response of any frequency bin of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. Although more detail is easily obtained, we concentrate on predicting the locations and sizes of all spurious sidelobes in the frequency response which are above any specified level. Certain sidelobes are present due to the particular window or weighting function that is being used. Spurious sidelobes or artifacts are extra sidelobes which are introduced if the FFT coefficients are quantized."

Some laser resonators and optical transmission links operate in this new region. By this method new results have been obtained for electrodes with elliptical contours."
"The gain of a negative-resistance parametric amplifier is highly sensitive to pump power changes. If the pump generator is noise-modulated in amplitude, a consequent gain modulation appears. In the presence of strong out-of-band interfering signals this can cause the output signal-to-noise ratio to deteriorate. The simple formula to estimate this effect has been derived and numerical results presented."

Dc radiance values from about 20 to more than 100 W/sr/cm2have been obtained for various small-area GaAs and AlGaAs diodes operated at current densities that yielded an operating half-life of at least several thousand hours. These radiance values are two to three orders of magnitude larger than those obtained with relatively large-area commercial light-emitting diode (LED) indicator lamps."

"Collecting the work of several previous authors concerning the cross-correlation functions of stationary narrow-band Gaussian processes with their Hilbert transforms, a brief derivation is given for the correlation matrix for the quadrature components of two cross-correlated stationary narrow-band Gaussian processes. The elements of the matrix are represented in terms of the auto-correlation functions RN(τ) and RN2(τ) of the two Gaussian processes, the cross-correlation function R12(τ), and the Hilbert transforms of these functions. Alternative representations are given in terms of the power density spectra S1(ω) and S2(ω) and the cross density spectrum S12(ω) of the two processes. The sixteen matrix elements are found to consist of a maximum of six independent functions."

"A general theoretical description of backscattering by turbulent irregularities is given. It is done so within the context of single scattering, which corresponds to the weak microwave reflections observed in atmospheric sounding. The traditional description for such effects is the cross-section approximation, which relates the backscattered power directly to the spectrum of turbulent irregularities evaluated at the Bragg wave-number K = 4π/λ. This analysis avoids most of the assumptions implicit in the former method, and shows that the scattering is not confined to the resonance condition for many situations of interest. The turbulence is assumed to be isotropic but not homogenous. The spectrum method is exploited, so that the backscattered power is expressed as the weighted integral of the wavenumber spectrum of turbulent irregularities, and a specific model need not be assumed until the last step. It is found that the spectral weighting function describing backscattering can be expressed as an infinite sum of the product of two terms. The first is determined solely by the sounder's aerial pattern. The second is fixed by the signal waveform and/or the distance variation of the intensity of inhomogenous turbulent fluctuations. In this way, the propagation features of the problem can be resolved before a turbulent model is introduced. The method is illustrated for omnidirectional, dipole, and narrow-beam aerials. Possibilities for extensions of this analysis are discussed last."
"Several years ago, let us say 1965, there were few serious technological challengers for large main memories and file storage systems for computers. Magnetic cores and rotating magnetic disks were the undisputed champions. While there was no lack of alternatives in the mid 1960's, cores and disks still offered potential improvements which could not easily be challenged by other technologies. The status of computing systems has advanced to a point where currently, as in the past, larger and faster access storage is needed. While there still exists room for improvement in cores and disk technology, the tradeoffs between size, speed, and cost suggest that other technologies may now offer certain advantages. As a result, numerous technologies have appeared recently to offer alternatives for large storage systems. Some of the more notable proposed technologies currently receiving considerable attention in the published literature will be reviewed. After a discussion of the limitations and technical aspects of magnetic recording and a systems analysis of direct access storage, a review of the more advanced technologies of surface wave acoustics, magnetooptic beam addressed memories, magnetic bubbles, switchable resistances, and integrated circuit memories of various types is undertaken. A discussion of the device concept with a possible system implementation for mass storage is presented along with conceivable densities, speed, advantages and disadvantages, and inherent limitations. The essential conclusion is that when all the necessary requirements for a storage system are taken into consideration, none of the more advanced technologies have a clear-cut distinct appeal over any other. Each has its own special advantages and attraction but only at the expense of some other features, such as special operating environments (e.g., low temperature), special operating modes (e.g., shift register), a limited range of applicability, or limited potential for further improvements in performance. There remains room for other inventions, particularly for storage systems with access times considerably faster than mechanical devices (i.e., one millisecond) but slower and cheaper than commonplace electronic speeds (i.e., one microsecond). However, because of the stringent requirements imposed by storage systems and cost/performance tradeoffs, it does not appear likely that these will be forthcoming in the near future."

"The code described detects those errors people most frequently make when transmitting decimal numbers. N digit numbers are encoded by appending a check digit determined by a computation involving the N digits. N + 1 digit numbers are \"checked\" by another computation. If an N digit number is encoded, and then any single digit is altered or any adjacent pair of digits is interchanged, the \"check\" computation will detect the error. A possible application: X-rays in hospitals are often indexed by patient number. Physicians request X-rays by number. Errors are discovered only when the plate is pulled and found to correspond to the wrong patient. By then the requester may no longer be available to supply the correct number. If numbers were encoded, most errors would be detected at the time the request was made."

"Previous attempts at modeling the \"Early effect\" in transistors were not valid over wide ranges of operating conditions. A model parameter is defined here which accounts for the desired effects and has the important attributes of being independent of current, temperature, or other parameters for a given device type. The expressions proposed recently by Logan and by Lindholm and Hamilton for including the Early effect in transistor current gain are shown to be equivalent for all temperatures and currents. A new method is proposed for measuring the empirical parameter VN."

 "The pronounced sensitivity of output-power/junction-temperature choracteristics for some silicon IMPATT diodes, which has been demonstrated by a number of authors, is shown to be related to the fact that the drift region of the epitaxial layer is not entirely punched through at lower junction temperatures. It is shown that a simple measurement of the static dVb/dT characteristic may be used to select diodes with power output characteristics that are relatively insensitive at a given frequency to junction temperature variations."

The principal development materials, dry powder, and liquid toners, are described on an electrochemical basis, and the toning mechanisms are reviewed. Finally, the principal applications and future trends of electrophotographic systems are outlined."
"The reasons for the creation of Illiac IV are described and the history of the Illiac IV project is recounted. The architecture or hard-ware structure of the Illiac IV is discussed--the Illiac IV array is an array processor with a specialized control unit (CU) that can be viewed as a small stand-alone computer. The Illiac IV software strategy is described in terms of current user habits and needs. Brief descriptions are given of the systems software itself, its history, and the major lessons learned during its development. Some ideas for future development are suggested. Applications of Illiac IV are discussed in terms of evaluating the function f(x) simultaneously on up to 64 distinct argument sets xi. Many of the time-consuming problems in scientific computation involve repeated evaluation of the same function on different argument sots. The argument sets which compose the problem data base must be structured in such a fashion that they can be distributed among 64 separate memories. Two matrix applications: Jacobi's algorithm for finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of real symmetric matrices, and reducing a real nonsymmetric matrix to the upper-Hessenberg form using Householder's transformations are discussed in detail. The ARPA network, a highly sophisticated and wide ranging experiment in the remote access and sharing of computer resources, is briefly described and its current status discussed. Many researchers located about the country who will use Illiac IV in solving problems will do so via the network. The various systems, hardware, and procedures they will use is discussed."
"During the last quarter century there has been a marked development and increased utilization of equipment and devices for military, industrial, consumer-use, entertainment, and medical applications that emit a large variety of nonionizing radiant energies. These include ultraviolet, infrared, visible light, microwaves, and radio-frequency waves, which are all classified as electromagnetic waves. Many of the electro-magnetic waves at certain frequencies, power levels, and exposure durations can produce biological effects or injury depending on multiple physical and biological variables. Although equipment which utilizes or emits electromagnetic waves provides immeasurable benefits to mankind, it may also create potential hazards to the individual through uncontrolled and excessive radiation emissions. Consequently, questions are being raised such as: 1) How serious are these problems, what are their dimensions, and what acute and/or chronic effects on the human body may be involved? 2) How adequate is our present knowledge about personnel hazards of these radiation types? 3) How can exposure be reduced? 4) How can better regulation be obtained to reduce exposure? This paper reviews the pathophysiology of exposure to ultraviolet, infrared, coherent electromagnetic radiation (laser), microwaves, and radio-frequency radiation, and the protection guides which have been established for these energies. It is also pointed out that there is a need to set limits on the amount of exposure individuals can accept with safety; setting standards, however, is a very complicated process. The objectives of protection are to prevent acute effects and to limit the risks of late effects. The second objective, namely, to limit the risk of possible late effects, becomes difficult. Protection standards are the results of empirical approaches to various problems reflecting current qualitative and quantitative knowledge. A numerical value for a standard of effect implies a knowledge of the effect produced at a given level of stress, and that both effect and stress are measurable. One problem is the definition of what an \"effect\" is and whether it can ultimately be shown to modify man's \"way of life\" or that of his offspring. If there were a clear-cut relationship between exposure level and pathophysiologic effect, the problem of setting standards would be greatly simplified. Not only are there numerous variables to be considered, but it is often difficult or impossible to obtain the necessary data to draw valid conclusions concerning effects of exposure to various radiant energies. It is important to maintain a proper perspective, and assess realistically the biomedical effects of these radiant energies so that the worker or general public will not be unduly exposed nor will research, development, and beneficial utilization of these energies be hampered or restricted by an undue concern for effects which may be nonexistent or minimal in comparison to other environmental hazards. There is a need for scientific competence--research aimed at creating credible knowledge and data which can stand against the pressure of legal challenge as well as the understandable bias of special interest groups."
"This is a tutorial review on the subject of mode selection in lasers. We begin with a historical review. After an introduction to the subject of modes in laser resonators and a brief review of the theory of laser gain saturation, the main body of the paper is devoted to a discussion of various mode-selection techniques, many which can be used to produce single-frequency laser operation. We discuss some systems for frequency stabilization of single-frequency lasers, and conclude with examples of laser applications where mode-selection techniques are required."

"A solution to the problem of realizing an inductorless low-pass elliptic transfer function has been proposed in which grounded FDNR elements are realized. The practical bias requirements for a resistive branch to ground have resulted in nonideal low-frequency rolloff in the passband. A simple technique is proposed to prevent low-frequency rolloff, to ensure direct-coupled operation, and at the same time to satisfy the practical constraints imposed by the bias requirements of the operational amplifiers."

This approach complements the Watkins' method."

When biased beyond threshold, the bulk GaAs0.7P0.3device exhibits an increase in resistance resulting in microwave switching in less than 200 ps."
"The equal areas rule method is used to determine the velocity-field characteristic (v = v(E)) from the experimental data measured on a GaAs sample when a high-field domain is in transit. The v = v(E) characteristic is close to that measured by Ruch and Kino for the electric fields below about 15 kV/cm and does not saturate for higher electric fields, which is in agreement with Heinle's theoretical analysis."
"A generalized Adler's equation for the injection-locking phenomenon is presented. The method for its approximate solution is then discussed. The modulation frequency dependence of the total nonlinear and delay distortion of the FM modulation in an injection phase-locked oscillator-amplifier is presented graphically, with either peak frequency deviation or gain as a parameter."
"A new principle of a magnetic-bubble-domain functional detector employing multiple three-terminal Hall elements is introduced. One- or two-dimensional arrayed detectors were made on this principle with both bulk and evaporated thin films of InSb. Sensitivity of about 10 mV for a 100-G inversion was obtained at a 10-mA element current with negligible offset voltage. An exclusive OR operation of bubble-domain logic was also demonstrated in the detection process."
"The principle of operation and the performance of a binary counter using a tunnel diode in the collector-emitter lead of a transistor is investigated. Simplified design procedure and lesser component configuration are the special features of the proposed hybrid binary."
"The threshold behavior of a practical tunnel-diode bistable trigger for trapezoidal and triangular input pulses is analytically studied. The results for a wide range of slopes of pulses are compared under different circuit conditions. It is noted that for slowly varying pulses the minimum overdrive requirement is less (which causes a larger delay) and increases with an increase in the slope."
"Conditions for the constitutive dyadic parameters of a lossless bianisotropic medium are derived. Applying these conditions it is shown that a conservation relation, previously shown to hold for lossless anisotropic media, also holds for lossless bianisotropic media. Further, it is shown that a lossless bianisotropic medium set in motion remains lossless."
"CW GaAs Schottky-barrier IMPATT oscillators have been fabricated using nichrome as the barrier metal. Several of the oscillators exhibited CW efficiencies ranging from 15 percent to 17.5 percent in C and X band. The best result was 19-percent efficiency in X band from an oscillator which produced 700 mW of output power. Noise performance which is comparable to those of transferred electron oscillators and reflex klystrons has also been observed."

Also, the output amplitude spectrum is shown to be related in a particularly simple way to the local oscillator amplitude spectrum."
"A new signal processing technique for the detection of FSK signals in white Gaussian noise is presented. The new feature of this technique is that the received FSK signal waveforms are first converted into new waveforms and the detection is carried out by using an appropriate matched filter matched to the new waveforms. The waveform conversion approach at the receiver is advantageous since the required matched filter for the new waveform is realizable more readily than that for the FSK waveforms."

"The significant advances in the development of international coordination in time determination and dissemination are briefly reviewed. Before 1955, time was determined exclusively by astronomical observations and international cooperation was primarily the concern of the International Astronomical Union (IAU). In the past 15 years, an independent time scale, based on atomic phenomena, has been realized. Astronomical and atomic time each have their field of application, and both require international cooperation in order to achieve the standards of accuracy now demanded. Responsibility for coordination has been assigned to the Bureau International de l'Heure (BIH). The adoption by the General Conference of Weights and Measures (CGPM) of an atomic definition of the second as the basic time interval in the international system of units has led to the establishment of an international scale of atomic time (IAT). In the dissemination of time by radio, a compromise system designed to meet the needs for both astronomical and atomic time was introduced experimentally and later recommended for general adoption by the International Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR). Following the recommendations of the international working party, an improved compromise system was inaugurated on January 1, 1972 and is now being followed by all major time services. Developments of new observational techniques now supplement conventional astronomical methods and offer a further useful field for international cooperation."
"The assistance available to a country desiring to establish reference bases in time and frequency suitable for its own needs is discussed. The emphasis is placed on helping countries with little prior experience in the field. An outline of the international organizations interested in time and frequency is given. The technical assistance programs which might be called upon by a country are mentioned. Specific recommendations can result only from individual discussions with the countries concerned."
"The basic properties of atomic primary frequency standards are reviewed. A continuously running frequency source combined with counting, storage, and display devices results in a clock. Time scales are obtained by setting clocks with respect to a convenient origin. The accuracy of a primary frequency standard is a combined theoretical and experimental assessment of the uncertainties of all known possible sources of bias from the idealized definition. Recommended standard measures for the stability are the spectral density of fractional frequency fluctuations (frequency domain) and the two-sample no-dead time Allan variance (time domain). The operation of atomic frequency standards is based on various methods of particle interrogation to observe the transitions, particle confinement to obtain sufficient interaction time, and particle preparation to obtain the desired energy level populations. Passive resonator and active oscillator (maser) modes of operation are discussed; the former has some fundamental advantages. A review of the state of the art and current practice shows that cesium beam resonator standards have the best documented accuracy capability (5 × 10-13) and, in their commercial versions, are presently the best available clocks. There are three concepts related to time: time interval, date, and synchronization. In order to assign dates to events, time scales have to be established. The steadily growing need for a very precise and uniform time scale has resulted in a new internationally coordinated time scale, IAT. Frequency metrology will have increasing impact on both length and voltage metrology in the near future."
"Fundamental considerations that arise in designing a time or frequency dissemination system, are discussed and some dissemination methods are surveyed. A section on \"Signal design for time and frequency dissemination\" briefly summarizes radio propagation characteristics, discusses time signal format design, and considers how noise affects time and frequency signals. We point out fundamental techniques of time and frequency dissemination and describe similarities between systems for time dissemination and navigation. The use of synchronous satellite transponders and commercial television systems for time dissemination is emphasized because of their great promise. No attempt is made to cover every existing dissemination system; some systems are treated elsewhere in this Special Issue on Time Frequency. The concluding section gives three categories of users according to their required accuracy and shows typical systems which can provide desired accuracies. Various dissemination techniques are charted and evaluated in terms of salient characteristics such as accuracy, geographical coverage, cost factors, and others. To alleviate an existing frequency spectrum problem, we suggest that designers of communication and navigation systems consider opportunities for including time and frequency dissemination in their systems."
"In order to assess the practical utility of high-performance frequency standards in field applications, the effect of the propagation medium must be taken into account. After a brief summary of noise processes, a discussion of the performance of current frequency standards is given, together with an estimate of the relative cost, reliability, and necessary system support for each type. Literature references on atmospheric physics are given to allow determinations of those limitations which the earth's atmosphere and ionosphere impose on the transfer of precise frequency and time. Formulas are presented to estimate the effects of changes in temperature, pressure, humidity, and frequency on the propagation path of electromagnetic waves. Current methods used to compute the path delay for HF, VLF, Loran-C, and other precise frequency transmissions are given. Based on this material, we outline needs for future frequency control capabilities."
"The Loran-C Navigation System is described in terms of its characteristics as a precise time and frequency dissemination system. The technique employed in timing a Loran-C chain is described, and user techniques are addressed including economic considerations. The accuracy available for both ground-wave and sky-wave transmission modes is shown to be a function of the low-frequency propagation factors and equipment delays involved. Phase and amplitude perturbations due to irregular terrain effects are shown to produce time difference discrepancies in inland service areas. Using broad assumptions, both ground-wave and sky-wave coverages are estimated. Experience shows that Loran-C provides an excellent medium for the dissemination of precise time and frequency on a continuous basis in both the ground-wave and sky-wave modes. The stability of the ground wave provides a submicrosecond precision capability, but the accuracy of the system is limited by propagation effects to about ± 1 µs. Loran-C sky-wave synchronization appears to be capable of ± 1 µs precision for one-hop daytime transmissions and an estimated ± 8 µs for one-hop nighttime transmissions. As distance is increased and more sky-wave hops are involved, nighttime synchronization precision is degraded to about ± 20 µs. Accuracy of sky-wave synchronization is limited to about ± 50 µs for both daytime and nighttime."
"VLF signals from 10 to 30 kHz play an important role in long-range time dissemination, communications, and navigation. A brief history of VLF transmissions is given with particular emphasis on the time dissemination capabilities of the Omega navigational system. Traditional methods are compared with modern capabilities. Traditional lead-edge time dissemination by VLF normally can provide an accuracy of a few milliseconds, although stabilized transmitters can permit an accuracy of better than 100 µs. Frequency comparisons to an accuracy of a few parts in 1011per day typically are made with commercially available equipment. The present four-station Omega system will be expanded to an eight-station worldwide network in the near future. With implementation of this global network, carrier ambiguities can be resolved at a receiving station with a cesium frequency standard over intercontinental ranges; phase can be maintained to better than 3 µs and frequency to about 1 part in 1012. Continuous maintenance of phase to better than 1 µs is indicated when using specialized techniques. Propagation aspects of VLF transmissions limit received accuracy; however, this is tempered by low attenuation of stable signals to long ranges."
"The advent of round-trip radar measurements has permitted the determination of the ranges to the nearby planets with greater precision than was previously possible. When the distances to the planets are known with high precision, the propagation delay for electromagnetic waves reflected by the planets may be calculated and used to synchronize remotely located clocks. Details basic to the operation of a lunar radar indicate a capability for clock synchronization to ±20 µs. One of the design goals for this system was to achieve a simple semiautomatic receiver for remotely located tracking stations. The lunar radar system is in operational use for deep space tracking at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and synchronizes five world-wide tracking stations with a master clock at Goldstone, Calif. Computers are programmed to correct the Goldstone transmissions for transit time delay and Doppler shifts so as to be received on time at the tracking stations; this dictates that only one station can be synchronized at a given time period and that the moon must be simultaneously visible to both the transmitter and receiver for a minimum time of 10 min. Both advantages and limitations of the system are given. Finally, an experiment is described which has detected the effects of lunar topography and libration on radar results; a monthly cyclic effect in time synchronization of about ± 6 µs is shown."
"This paper discusses the role of time and frequency in three areas: 2) the operational Navy Navigation Satellite System, NNSS; 2) an experimental low-altitude navigation concept termed TIMATION; 3) proposals for advanced navigation satellites. These operating, experimental, and proposed systems all use concepts which allow the user to remain passive. The operational NNSS system uses the Doppler technique to establish user positions to ~100 m. In this concept, the frequencies received from the satellite are compared to the frequencies generated in the user equipment. One can also compare the time a signal arrives from a satellite clock to a time generated in the user equipment clock for passive ranging. The paper shows that this passive ranging problem is easily transformed to the celestial navigation problem. Extension of these techniques allows one to use satellites as clock transporters and hence to compare clocks located throughout the globe to 0.5 µs. Experimental results are shown. It has been possible to determine the effects of radiation on quartz crystals and to determine that this effect is due principally to protons. System concepts are described which show this clock/time technique can determine user position, velocity, and time continuously, accurately, and globally."
"Many present-day radio navigation satellite systems employ the use or measurement of time or frequency to provide a position fix for the user vehicle. For example, the position fix obtained by the U. S. Navy's Navigation Satellite Systems (Transit) is based on the precise measurement of the Doppler shift from a single satellite observed by the user vehicle, plus the satellite's orbital elements and time. The time of the satellite's orbit parameter transmission is controlled by a crystal oscillator having a short-term stability of 2 parts in 1011. Multiple geostationary satellites (36000-km altitude) have the capability to provide a near instantaneous position fix using range measurements of the two-way propagation time of an RF signal initiated at a ground station and sent to a user vehicle by one satellite. The user retransmits this signal through the satellites to the ground where a position fix is obtained. Knowledge of user altitude, in the case of an aircraft, also is required. Low-altitude satellites can also be employed to provide a position fix via two-way ranging, but with a significant delay in obtaining a position fix. Inherent to this and many other navigation concepts is the accurate measurement of frequency, time, or time interval. If range is to be described by the time required for an RF signal to propagate between the satellite and the user or ground station, time interval becomes significant. For example, it takes approximately 1 µs for a radio wave to travel 0.3 km in free space. Time interval is often measured by counting cycles or by phase comparisons using highly stable and accurate frequency sources. NASA conducted tests of these concepts employing the ATS 1 and 3 satellites, and Nimbus 3 and 4 satellites. The test results indicate that locations of ships and aircraft can be determined to within 3-5 km, one sigma, by these satellite methods, and that location accuracy is both a function of the RF employed as well as the extent of knowledge of the satellite orbit."
"Time/frequency technology provides a reliable aircraft collision avoidance system (CAS) that can operate in either synchronous or asynchronous modes. Precision time-ordered techniques of CAS provide both range and range-rate measurements in a one-way sense to all aircraft as well as ground stations within range of transmitted microwave signals. The cooperative system utilizes exact frequency references coupled with precise synchronization: control of frequency to 1 part in 108and time to less than 1 µs. In addition to performing specific functions of protecting aircraft, the time/frequency CAS provides a means for wide dissemination of submicrosecond timing. Flying clocks, which are an integral part of the airborne CAS, have been providing transcontinental and intercontinental transfer of time since 1964. CAS ground stations can serve as depositories of time and frequency derived from flying clocks, satellites, Loran-C and Omega navigation systems, or television transfer referenced to national and international time/frequency standards. Airborne relay of CAS time provides a ready means for local transfer of time to users that are not within line of sight to a ground station. Thus time and frequency can be disseminated for applications other than collision avoidance. In the process of developing the technology and originating CAS, new systems for communication, position determination, navigation, and vehicle surveillance evolved. Such systems can be structured to operate at high data rates, provide improved accuracy and use less RF spectrum than existing techniques."
"Current and future problems are presented for the land, sea, and air transportation environments that are, or can be, solved using time/frequency technology. Problem areas in transportation encompass vehicle surveillance and location, traffic management, collision avoidance, command and control, communications, navigation, and search and rescue. Time accuracy requirements vary widely from seconds to submicroseconds. The need for time/frequency technology in the orderly and safe movement of people and material is shown to be a function of the type of transportation and environment involved. Various characteristics of the transportation environments are discussed, and time-related aspects of transportation both today and in the future are designated. Transportation statistics indicate tremendous growth in the years ahead with concomitant problems. We consider the impact of the vast difference in the various economic budgets of transportation medium users, and the stated government policy of requiring users of federally operated aids and services to pay their fair share of the costs. Recommendations are presented for broad coordination in the development and introduction of electronic systems for transportation services. We conclude that time/frequency technology can solve some of today's problems in transportation, and it offers economic integrated-system solutions to future problems with concurrent frequency spectrum conservation. The interrelationships of navigation, communication, and time/frequency systems should encourage coordinated efforts of disciplines in the design of multipurpose systems as opposed to a proliferation of new single-use facilities."
"Modern communications systems make use of sophisticated multiplexing techniques in order to achieve efficient spectrum utilization and thereby realize the maximum number of message channels through a particular transmission medium. Synchronization of transmit/receive carrier (or clock) generators is essential in such systems to avoid distortion; also, close tolerances on the accuracy of carrier and pilot frequencies must be imposed to maintain transmission through minimal bandwidth channel selection filters. Typical requirements on both synchronization and accuracy for several categories of commercial communications systems range from several parts in 106to a few parts in 1010."
"A concept of a totally digital communications network is described in which all signals are converted into digital form and remain so as they are multiplexed, switched, and transmitted. To permit time-division techniques for such network processing, and thus realize significant economic advantages, the digital signals must be either generated in synchronism or brought into synchronism. While the switching portion of this network is not yet in service, some of the transmission network already exists and the evolution toward a digital transmission hierarchy is well underway. The hierarchy consists of 1) terminals which convert analog Signals into digital form suitable for transmission, 2) transmission facilities which are available at various capacities, and 3) multiplexers which can derive several lower capacity digital facilities from a single high-capacity system. Such a network, when complete, can also disseminate time and frequency for other uses with the same accuracy as required by the network. The network requires that the relative phase difference between any two signals must be bounded, which means exact matching of the long-term average frequency throughout the network. Signal-processing time and variations in propagation velocity in various media-cable, radio, waveguide-control the short-term accuracy. This network can thus provide time-and-frequency information proportional to the observation time. Available techniques that can achieve such accuracy for the network are discussed."
"The present stage of development of long-baseline interferometry using independent atomic frequency standards is reviewed. The technique is being applied to precision geodesy and astrometry and shows great promise as a means for the intercomparison of national time scales at the 1-ns error level. This paper discusses the development of radio interferometry and, in particular, the theory and practice of interferometry over a very wide (effective) bandwidth. The superb phase stability of the hydrogen maser frequency standard in the range of 100 s to several hours makes it the ideal local oscillator for long-baseline Interferometry."
"Geodetic science (geodesy) is that branch of science concerned with determining the size, shape, and gravitational field of the earth, and precisely mapping its surface features. Astronomic observations provide essential information in the geodetic process. Both the earth-based observing stations and the observed extraterrestrial bodies (stars, planets, natural and artificial earth satellites) are in motion, creating time-dependent coordinate systems and making epoch, interval, and synchronization important. Modern geodesy uses the most sophisticated optical and electronic equipment in measurements, and the timing requirements have become increasingly stringent. Systems that require accurate timing often have potential in the determination of time. Lunar laser ranging, a currently developing technique with many exciting geodetic implications, may develop into a practical method for the determination of Universal Time (UT1) to a new order of accuracy."
"Infrared frequency synthesis (IFS) techniques are briefly surveyed, and some important results are summarized. The recent measurement of the frequency of the methane-stabilized He-Ne laser is significant due to the accurate measurement of the methane wavelength and its fundamental role in metrology. The possibilities of an improved value for the speed of light and of additional applications for frequency measurements at various levels of accuracy are discussed."
"The recent successful extension of frequency synthesis upward in the infrared to the 88-THz frequency of the very stable methane frequency standard has implications for expanded uses of frequency/time metrology and hence of frequency/time dissemination systems. After further refinements of the infrared frequency synthesis techniques, metrologists will have the opportunity to define a value for the speed of light and to use a particular frequency standard --the most accurate one--as a unified standard for frequency, time, and length."
"The concept of time transfer between two geographically separated locations by using nearly simultaneous reception times from a common transmission has been used very fruitfully, e.g., the TV line-10 time transfer system and Loran-C. Some germane aspects of the concept are discussed and use of a signal from the optical pulsar NP0532 as the common transmitter is considered. Theoretical considerations suggest that time could be transferred using this mode to an accuracy of about 2 µs and with global coverage. Some data were made available from Lawrence Radiation Laboratory giving the dates of pulsar events received at their observatory and also at the Harvard Observatory. A precision of about 13 µs was inferred from the data analysis. This optical pulsar time transfer system seems to be feasible and worthy of further consideration because of the high accuracy and precision (a few microseconds for both) potentially achievable. For this potential, the development costs appear to be favorably competitive."
"The development of the National Physical Laboratory for metrology in Egypt is described. The Frequency Standards Department has been maintaining a cesium frequency standard since 1967. Reception of VLF transmissions is used for phase comparison with good results. Future goals include improving the reliability of the system and reception of Loran-C as well as investigating applications of standard frequencies for other measurements, such as new standards of length and voltage."
"A rubidium frequency standard has been designed that is compatible with ruggedized military equipment. Many of the special features and unique characteristics, such as the thermoelectric cooler, are described."
"Time-of-day information could be added to the signals of the Omega worldwide VLF navigation system by means of a digital code. This could be valuable in resetting precision clocks and in monitoring them for malfunction. Also, Omega's worldwide coverage could then provide timing for automatic recording of data, such as geophysical information, in remote locations."
"American TRANSIT satellites have permitted improvements in the synchronization of satellite control networks. A prototype model for the decoding of time signals has been built and tested in the station of Brétigny Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). This system has been introduced in all the networks and as far back as 1969 an initial synchronization project was established. The rms value for each pass (\"internal\" precision) is about few microseconds and the relative precision, respectively, to the TRANSIT time scale is between 10 and 20 µs. Further refinements in the equipment and better knowledge of systematic errors give hope that one could obtain routinely, in the near future, an absolute accuracy of about 10 µs respective to an international scale (UTC or IAT)."
"A satellite time synchronization technique has been used for synchronization-of remotely separated clocks during the past several years. The NASA Network has been successfully synchronized to an accuracy of tens of microseconds via the NASA Geodetic Earth Orbiting Satellite GEOS-11. The results indicate that a polor orbit satellite having an on-board clock can effectively be used to synchronize clocks on a global basis."
"The use of artificial satellites for time synchronization of geographically distant clocks has been demonstrated as early as 1962. Most techniques up to now have been plagued with one or more problems due to satellite motion, nonreciprocity of propagation, or equipment delay measurements. By using the ATS-3 satellite with its two C-band transponder channels one can avoid these problems through simple and straightforward techniques for synchronization to accuracies of tenths of microseconds. Portable cesium clocks were used to verify the accuracy of such a system."
"Because of the increasing interest in time and frequency dissemination via television signals, NBS has sponsored an experiment using an active time and frequency code transmitted on a U. S. television network encompassing nationwide coverage. The code format is discussed and statistical results of system stability using the network path from New York City, N. Y., to Boulder, Colo., are presented through plots of phase with respect to time and plots of time domain stability using the Allan variance. Comparison is made of the frequency transfer capability of the line-1 method to the 3.57954 ... MHz color subcarrier signal used for network colorcasts. The active line-1 TV time system offers distinct advantages over existing dissemination methods utilized within the continental U. S. of principal interest is the short measurement period required for a time or frequency calibration. The system typically permits calibration of a remote standard to 1 part in 1011within one-half hour."
"A newly emerging field of fleet vehicle command and control in the urban environment is discussed. The urban environment and economic considerations present a major challenge to the development of a location system which is of major interest to the time frequency community."
"Using coordinate independent dyadic notation the constitutive parameters of a moving medium are derived in a form that is more concise than what is obtained if the conventional matrix methods are used. The result allows a study on the definite character of the constitutive parameters. It is found that if a medium with positive definite symmetric dyadics ε and μ is set in a uniform motion, these dyadics remain positive definite if and only if the velocity does not exceed the ray velocity of the medium."
"The use of \"epoch,\" \"date,\" and similar terms to designate a moment on a time scale, time interval, etc., in time/frequency terminology is discussed."
"A number of classical theorems of electromagnetism are extended to bianisotropic media. A notation that simplifies the analysis when dealing with such media is employed throughout."
"Electromagnetic scattering by a perfectly conducting body of finite extent is considered. The operator inverse to the integral operator of the magnetic-field formulation is shown to be an analytic function of the complex wavenumber k, except at certain points where it has poles. Furthermore, an explicit representation of the inverse operator is given."
"A simple proof is presented of the most general form of the state model for arbitrarily degenerate linear time-invariant passive networks."
"It is shown that the infinite summation form of the starred transform for nonsynchronous and multirate sampled-data systems does not contain the usual additive term which is dependent on the value of the function at t =0. This justifies the direct utilization of the conventional block diagram representations in the generation of frequency response data."
"A coupled transmission line with passive terminations may be designed in such a way that a reflection-free structure results which behaves like a directional coupler. It exhibits large bandwidth and good directivity but high insertion loss. Its application to data cables in computation systems appears feasible."
"A noise source arising from velocity fluctuations of drifting carriers in the depletion region of the metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) diode is identified. This source of noise adds to the shot noise and becomes prominent at high current densities, when the shot-noise contribution is small because of space-charge smoothing."

"Room temperature measurements were taken at 23.9 GHz on an isolator fabricated by placing a 1-µm vacuum-deposited recrystallized thin film of InSb in K-band waveguide with the plane of the film parallel to the electric field and with an external magnetic field applied normal to the film (the field displacement mode). The best case gave an insertion loss of 7.4 dB, nonreciprocity of 13 dB, and isolation of 20.5 dB in an external magnetic field of 20 kOe."
"Relations between the Haar and Walsh/Hadamard (W/H) transforms, which are proved, show that for some applications the Haar transform performs as well as, and faster than, the W/H transform.

"The encoding of information as the modulation of a grid is explored as the means for allowing the extraction of relevant details or features from images. A major aspect of this approach is the replacement of the heuristics in certain image processing tasks by simple Fourier filtering. Specific examples and particular implementations of coding schemes are described in order to show the wide applicability of the concept. The examples chosen fall in the domains of scene analysis, difference extraction from successive images, automatic extraction of range, extraction of features such as planes, recording of three-dimentional imagery, and the processing of a single coded view to give a set of stereo related pairs."
"In processing continuous-time signals by digitalmeans, it is necessary to represent the signal by a digital sequence. There are many ways other than periodic sampling for obtaining such a sequence. The requirements for such representations and some examples are discussed within the framework of simulating linear time-invariant systems. The representation of digital sequences by other digital sequences is also discussed, with particular emphasis on the use of such representations to implement a nonlinear warping of the digital frequency axis. Some applications and hardware implementation of this digital-frequency warping are described."
"Electromagnetic waves from the lower radio frequencies up through the optical spectrum can generate a myriad of effects and responses in biological specimens. Some of these effects can be harmful to man at high radiation intensities, producing burns, cataracts, chemical changes, etc. Biological effects have been reported at lower radiation intensities, but it is not now known if low-level effects are harmful. Even behavioral changes have been reported. Most of the effects are not harmful under controlled conditions, and can thereby be used for therapeutic purposes and to make useful diagnostic measurements. The problem of microwave penetration into the body with resultant internal power absorption is approached from both the theoretical and the experimental viewpoints. The results are discussed in terms of therapeutic warming of tissues and possible hazards caused by internal \"hot spots.\" The absorption and scattering effects of light in biological tissues are reviewed. Molecular absorption peaks in the optical spectrum are useful for making molecular concentration measurements by spectroscopy. Much of the related work in the literature is summarized, some new results are presented, and several useful applications of wave energy and medical instruments are discussed."

Self-oscillating frequency (local frequency), signal frequency (IF), and output frequency were 20.1 GHz, 1.5 GHz, and 18.6 GHz, respectively. The best result achieved was a maximum power output of +14 dBm, a 3-dB bandwidth of 1 GHz, and a self-oscillating frequency stability of 1.2 × 10-6/°C."
"The force of attraction between the capacitor plates is used to measure voltage by making one of the plates deflectable under the force of attraction. A strain gauge mounted on this plate suffers a shear strain which is detected electrically by the conventional technique of the Wheatstone bridge followed by an amplifier. The output of the amplifier was found to be linearly related to the square of applied voltage between the plates, as it theoretically should be. The technique can be used to measure dc and ac voltages, particularly when their magnitudes are high and there is also high impedance."

"It was recently proposed to express watts per hertz in decibels as dBJ, or decibels referred to one joule. We point out in this letter that there is broad freedom a) to calculate logarithms and b) to assign dimensions.

This theorem can be used for describing the noise performance of linearized detector circuits."
"Data showing the radiation effects of 10-MeV electrons on the operating characteristics of GaAs Schottky barrier IMPATT diodes are presented. The percentage of decrease in RF power level is shown to be a function of both the radiation dose rate and the nonradiated oscillator power level. However, the decrease is shown to be independent of the radiation pulse length between 0.1 and 4.5 µs. In addition, the diode recovery times are found to be the same as the radiation pulse turnoff time."

"The power loss, due to material absorption from an HE11mode propagating on an optical fiber, is derived and approximations are introduced which simplify its calculation. The attenuation constant of the HE11mode, for fibers with a small index of refraction difference between the core and the cladding, is shown to be equal to the known (measured) loss of the material in bulk multiplied by the fraction of modal power flowing through the lossy region."
"A low-cost millimeter-wave glow-discharge detector characterized by a responsibility of 0.177 V/W, a rise time of 2.5 µs, and a noise equivalent power (NEP) of ∼10-13W/Hz when used in a synchronous detection mode is described. Low NEP is accomplished through a novel biasing arrangement of a commercially available three-electrode glow-discharge lamp originally intended for triggering applications. This biasing arrangement leads to rms noise voltage suppression of nearly 20 dB. This, together with other known properties, makes this detector particularly suited for use in closed-range microwave hologarphic arrays."

"Automatic translation of the lights and shades of a picture into a digital record tape and its reconversion to a picture were elements of the Bartlane picture transmission system in operation on telegraph circuits fifty years ago. s. Using digital signals on submarine cables, the Bartlane system handled nearly 500 pictures of portant news events prior to the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939. Publication of the first pictures cabled from New York to London in 1920-1921 established the Bartlane method of employing the picture machines off line and using standard printing telegraph apparatus operated by regular telegraph personnel for accurate transmission of the picture signals. With the communication link determined, experimental work was concentrated on improvements in the methods of converting a picture into a telegraph tape and of recovering the picture."
"Fidelity measures and criteria for visual communications are discussed. It is recognized that the basis of visual fidelity assessment is subjective judgement of reproduced pictures. However, in design and elsewhere there is also need for explicit evaluation of visual communication waveforms. The rate distortion theory model for such evaluations is brought out and two existing evaluations of limited scope, viz., weighted noise measurement and K rating, are reviewed in relation to that theory. It is suggested that video distortion can largely be identified with visibility of errors in reproduction. Relevant findings on luminance vision are examined. It is found that a comprehensive model of visibility would incorporate excitation, inhibition, and masking, and that considerable quantitative knowledge of these factors already exists. Looking ahead, a block schematic is given of a meter which might measure distortion produced by quantization noise in a video feed back quantizer."
"A great variety of intraframe coding techniques have been proposed and demonstrated in recent years. Most of them exploit the properties of both the image and the human viewer. These properties are discussed briefly so as to provide a framework for describing the various coding techniques. The development of intraframe coders has been an evolutionary process. Techniques such as delta modulation (DM) and differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) which were proposed in the early 1950's are still being actively studied and improved today. A survey of this early work is given as a preliminary to more detailed discussion of the work from 1967 to the present. Three main approaches are evident in these studies. First, by making linearizing assumptions, frequency domain analysis can be applied to the problem of minimizing the visibility of granular coding noise. Second, in order to exploit the nonlinear properties of the human visual system, a time domain approach to the development of coding algorithms is found most useful. Third, by exploiting only the statistics of the source, efficient reversible encoding operations can be developed. These three approaches are dealt with in some detail. Possible avenues for further research are pointed out."
"Television signals contain a great deal of frame-to-frame redundancy because picture areas are scanned in every frame whether they have changed or not. That portion of the signal describing stationary images need not be retransmitted in every frame if adequate memory is provided at the receiver. The signal describing moving images must be transmitted, of course, but it requires progressively less fidelity as the motion increases. Several techniques are described for obtaining efficient transmission by taking into account the similarity in the signal from frame to frame. Basic to most of these techniques is the need to separate the signal into segments that have changed significantly since the previous frame and ones that have not changed."
"The theoretical minimum channel capacity required to transmit a given source at a given average distortion level is discussed. The limitations and applications of the theory are reviewed with particular emphasis on the use of the results for guiding practical system design and for bounding system performance. Applications are oriented toward video sources."
"Picture coding by first dividing the picture into sub-pictures and then performing a linear transformation on each sub-picture cud quantizing and coding the resulting coefficients is introduced from a heuristic point of view. Various transformation, quantization, and coding strategies are discussed. A survey of all known applications of these techniques to monochromatic image coding is presented along with a summary of the dependence of performance on the basic system parameters and some conclusions."
"Image processing of spacecraft images has been carried on at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory since 1964. The most recent advances in removal of geometric distortion and residual image effects along with various types of mapping projections are covered. The recent applications of image processing to the areas of bio-medicine, forensic sciences, and astronomy are discussed. These treatments are of a tutorial nature and should serve as a guide to more complete discussions on the subjects."
"A specific relationship between some of the current knowledge and thought concerning human vision and the problem of controlling subjective distortion in processed images are reviewed."
"This is a review of techniques for digtal restoration of images. Optical and other analog processors are not discussed. Restoration is considered from the point of view of space-domain as well as of spatial-frequency-domain descriptions of images. Consideration is restricted to degradations arising from noise and spatially invariant blurring. However, many of the space-domain methods apply, with minor modifications, to spatially varying blur as well. Some examples of restoration are included to illustrate the methods discussed. Included also is a section on methods whose potential has not yet been exploited for image restoration."
"A description of motion degradation in linear incoherent optical systems is presented. Given a mechanical description of the motion, an equivalent linear space-variant system containing all the motion effects is derived, and detailed examples of common types of variant and invariant motion are included. Following a review of restoration techniques for motion blur, a method for image restoration applicable to a large class of space-variant systems is presented. This method is based on the decomposition of the degradation into geometrical coordinate distortions and a space-invariant operation. A computer simulation of space-variant restoration is included."
"A technique is introduced for inverse filtering of linear shift-variant imaging systems. The technique requires that the linear system be decomposed into a distortion of the input plane followed by a shift-invariant operation and terminated by a distortion of the output plane. Such a representation is motivated by the fact that the coma aberration may be represented in this way. The paper includes computer-generated examples of the inversion of a coma-like system with and without additive observation noise as well as one example of the inversion of a system specified by an arbitrary distortion."
"Recursive linear and nonlinear estimation concepts are applied to the problem of image enhancement, whereby procedures for the derivation of the estimators are developed. These procedures are applicable to enhancement of images characterized statistically by their mean and correlation function. Design of an approximate time invariant and a time varying estimator is discussed and the implications of vector scanning are investigated. Feasibility of the approach is illustrated by means of examples, and the computational advantages are presented."
"A dynamic model for pictorial data that can be represented by a random field of an exponential autocorrelation function is developed. A partial difference equation describes the dynamic model and is used to realize a two-dimensional recursive filter that gives a Bayesian-estimate of the pictorial data from a noisy observation of the data. It is assumed that the noise is additive, white, and uncorrelated with the signal. Practical application of the estimation technique is illustrated by applying the results to enhance several pictures. A comparison of this technique and its one-dimensional counterpart (Kalman filter) is made, and generalization of the estimation technique to other autoregressive sources is considered."
"Two practical questions in developing an image enhancement computer program are considered: the data structure for the matrix of image samples, and computing the FFT of a large matrix. Experience in developing such programs is discussed, and characteristics of an enhancement program developed for the CDC 6600/7600 computers are described."
"Three computational algorithms for performing spatial frequency filtering are compared and tradeoffs developed. Although each method is defined by a convolution relation, the convolution computations are different. Equal filter point-spread functions are assumed to effect the comparison. If the filter point-spread function is nonzero only over a small area, then the computation tradeoff is simply the well-known comparison between direct convolution and the fast Fourier trsnsform (FFT). If the filter point-spread function is nonzero over a large area, then a recursive filter is competitive with the FFT. Core memory requirements for this case are smallest with the recursive filter. Experimental examples are given to illustrate the subjective evaluation problem."
"This paper is the result of editorial license in the effect that it is designed to augment the invited papers for enhancement and restoration in this issue. Unfortunately this editor found the genesis of a special issue to be a very dynamic process, and as such this paper has experienced many contortions. However, it is hoped that a few topics not covered earlier, but which warrant some discussion in a digital image enhancement issue, can find a home (albeit brief and uneasy) in this editorial. The topics discussed below include some heuristic techniques which might be useful to the image enhancement objective, some superresolution and positive restoration techniques (still of esoteric interest), some comments on experimental methods, and a bibliography restricted to digital techniques for image restoration and/or enhancement."
"It is well-known that no permanent distribution of free charge can exist in a conductor. A common development of a \"relaxation time\" concludes that a charge distribution imposed in a conductor will decay exponentially with a time constant ε/σ. This development utilizes Ohm's law, J = σE, with σ constant, which is inappropriate for a variable charge density. The resulting relaxation time implies charge decay in a time which is too short by orders of magnitude."
"By using the body as a monopole antenna the admittance and radiation efficiency have been measured in the frequency range 30-70 MHz. It is concluded that there are no resonance effects. The efficiency is about -2 dB at the higher frequencies."

"The necessary conditions for maximum power transfer to the outputs of a multiport are discussed. The condition Z = Z0*is sufficient. A solution to this problem is not generally unique, because the matrix Z must satisfy the matrix equation Z(Z0+ Z0*)-1E0= - Z0(Z0+ Z0*)-1E0+ E0. When the power transfer is maximum, only the total power of the equivalent sources is equally divided between the \"passive\" multiport and the ports."

"Injection-locked oscillators are increasingly being used as FM amplifiers. When the injection signal is large, as commonly used for FM amplifications, however, the first-order theory previously developed is inadequate. An alternative theory to determine the stability of locking with large signal injection is presented."
"A new RC-amplifier resonator has the Q invariance shown possible by Geffe, and in addition it is ω0invariant (resonant frequency independent of amplifier gain) and requires 4Q2times less amplifier bandwidth. The independence of ω0and Q makes it easy to design tunable, variable-Q filters with noninteracting controls."
"Using n differential-input operational amplifiers, two active RC circuits realizing the general nth-order low-pass transfer functions are presented. These realizations are achieved to within a constant multiplier greater or smaller than unity, respectively."
"A simple low-frequency technique for the measurement of small delay times using an operational amplifier as an integrator is described. It is shown that the frequency capability of the operational amplifier is relatively unimportant and that it should be possible to use this technique for the measurement of the transit times of transistors well into the microwave range."
"The theoretical limit for the selectivity of lumped passive RC null networks is extended by allowing realizations which exhibit transmission gains."
"To show the feasibility of a path-length modulator in the highest frequency band of a waveguide transmission system, two models have been successfully constructed and tested in the 100-110-GHz range. Combined with the results previously obtained in the 50-60-GHz range, the above results indicate that the path-length modulator can be built satisfactorily anywhere in the entire frequency band of the waveguide transmission system presently under consideration."

"The critical n0L product of semiconductor plates with negative longitudinal ac mobility and finite thickness is investigated theoretically as a function of the sample dimensions and the degree of dielectric loading. In case of a small sample thickness-to-length ratio the stability range is found to be strongly reduced due to higher order characteristic oscillations."

"An exact solution of the equation describing the dynamics of the current generation in the avalanche region of the Read diode is presented. The avalanche current is composed of a transient component and a steady-state component. For ac diode excitation the latter one contains a large number of harmonics. A brief study, in which the space-charge effect is neglected, illustrates the usefulness of the presented solution. A threshold frequency is defined which characterizes the avalanche current transients and specifies the range of validity of the resuits obtained by commonly used simplified approaches."

"Static differential negative resistance due to the geometrical effect of a bulk element is discussed and the experimental results with an n-GaAs element of concave geometry are presented. It is shown that the static negative resistance appears as a result of the development of a stationary high-field domain in the expanding part of the element."
"A high-speed image scnnner using acoustic surface waves with tapped electrodes connected to the Si photodiode array is proposed. Reading of optical numerical characters was demonstrated with 7 bit at a scanning rate of 1 MHz. High speed of up to several tens of megahertz is promising by properly selecting the shape of electrodes and photodiodes."
"A computationally fast algorithm that yields an approximation to the amplitude A of a quadrature pair, AX and AY, is given by A'=AX + a ċ AY ≃A (=√AX2+ AY2) where a = 0.2673, AX is the larger magnitude of the pair, and AY the smaller. When the phase angle of pairs is uniformly distributed over the range (0, 2π), this algorithm yields the exact mean with the maximum deviation of 0.1039A. Thus this algorithm gives more accurate estimates than those obtained by Robertson's algorithm, which uses a of 0.5 and yields an error of 8.7 percent in the estimation of mean with the maximum deviation of 0.1180A."

"A constrained least mean-squares algorithm has been derived which is capable of adjusting an array of sensors in real time to respond to a signal coming from a desired direction while discriminating against noises coming from other directions. Analysis and computer simulations confirm that the algorithm is able to iteratively adapt variable weights on the taps of the sensor array to minimize noise power in the array output. A set of linear equality constraints on the weights maintains a chosen frequency characteristic for the array in the direction of interest. The array problem would be a classical constrained least-mean-squares problem except that the signal and noise statistics are assumed unknown a priori. A geometrical presentation shows that the algorithm is able to maintain the constraints and prevent the accumulation of quantization errors in a digital implementation."
"Maxwell's original work on electromagnetic theory is reviewed. All the general equations prominently displayed by the scientist in his two important works have been cast in modern notation with particular emphasis on the connotation. The relationship between two integral forms of the Faraday-Maxwell and the Ampère-Maxwell laws has been examined in detail, all within the framework of Maxwell's theory, and using the conventional concepts of space and time. An example is given to show the exact nature of the integral form of the Faraday-Maxwell equation based on the Special Theory of Relativity. Some typical ambiguities found in many presentations of Maxwell's theory are pointed out and two unconventional presentations are commented on."
"This paper discusses various aspects of diffraction and focusing for waves in anisotropic crystals, and the concepts are applicable to electromagnetic, ultrasonic bulk, or ultrasonic surface waves in homogeneous but arbitrarily anisotropic crystals. A numerical technique based on an angular spectrum of plane waves representation is shown to produce theoretical intensity profiles in good agreement with acoustooptic probe measurements of the diffraction field of a slit-type ultrasonic transducer launching quasi-longitudinal and quasi-shear waves in quartz along on axis of extreme anisotropy where the wave normal and the direction of energy flow are separated by angles greater than 20°. A theoretical study of two-dimensional focusing structures for use in anisotropic crystals reveals that a launching transducer fabricated in the shape of the relevant group-velocity surface can be far superior in producing a well-defined focus to a structure having the shape of a circular arc. The computation techniques can be applied to obtain the diffraction field of any arbitrary aperture function and the examples described, theoretical and experimental, concern acoustic waves in crystals demonstrating extreme elastic anisotropies, in fact much more extreme than would be encountered in analogous cases of optical diffraction. Because of current relevance to device research, emphasis in the latter sections of the paper is placed on ultrasonic surface waves."
"When digital signal processing operations are implemented on a computer or with special-purpose hardware, errors and constraints due to finite word length are unavoidable. The main categories of finite register length effects are errors due to A/D conversion, errors due to roundoffs in the arithmetic, constraints on signal levels imposed by the need to prevent overflow, and quantization of system coefficients. The effects of finite register length on implementations of linear recursive difference equation digital filters, and the fast Fourier transform (FFT), are discussed in some detail. For these algorithms, the differing quantization effects of fixed point, floating point, and block floating point arithmetic are examined and compared. The paper is intended primarily as a tutorial review of a subject which has received considerable attention over the past few years. The groundwork is set through a discussion of the relationship between the binary representation of numbers and truncation or rounding, and a formulation of a statistical model for arithmetic roundoff. The analyses presented here are intended to illustrate techniques of working with particular models. Results of previous work are discussed and summarized when appropriate. Some examples are presented to indicate how the results developed for simple digital filters and the FFT can be applied to the analysis of more complicated systems which use these algorithms as building blocks."
"A pulsed metallic-plasma generator is described which utilizes a vacuum arc as the plasma source. The arc is initiated on the surface of a consumable cathode which can be any electrically conductive material. Ignition is accomplished by using a current pulse to vaporize a portion of a conductive film on the surface of an insulator separating the cathode from the ignition electrode. The film is regenerated during the ensuing arc. Over 108ignition cycles have been accomplished by using four 0.125-in (0.318-cm) diameter zinc cathodes operating in parallel and high-density aluminum-oxide insulators. A plasma consisting of cathode material is emitted at the rate of about 10-7kg for each coulomb of charge emitted. The plasma is ejected in the form of a high-velocity highly directional conical plume through a ring-shaped anode. One or more magnetic field coils may be used to control the impedance and the direction of the plume. The normal pulsed operating parameters for the generator are a few hundred volts and a few hundred amperes with pulsewidths ranging from 50 to 500 µs and repetition frequencies up to 300 pulses per second (pps). Among the applications being investigated for the generator are metal deposition, vacuum pumping, electric propulsion, and high-power dc arc interruption."

The electrooptical processor can furnish continuously and unambiguously, in the form of an optical image, the distribution of radio emission present in the entire effective scan sector of an array without the necessity of electronic steering."

"The principles of ray optics and, in more detail, some selected applications of ray techniques to electromagnetics are reviewed briefly. It is shown how a systematic use of matrix representation for the wavefront curvature and for its transformations simplify the handling of arbitrary pencils of rays and, consequently, the field computations. The same methods apply to complex rays which give a means of describing the effects of reflections and refractions on Gaussian beams. The relations of ray optics to other disciplines are also briefly discussed."
"Theorems concerning electromagnetic fields in linear nonconducting bianisotropic media are investigated. After establishing their symmetry properties, the constitutive relations are examined under time reversal and spatial inversion transformations. Conditions under which the image method and the reciprocity relationships can be applied are discussed. Dyadic Green's functions and duality relations are also derived. With a postulated Lagrangian density, Maxwell's equations are obtained from Hamilton's principle, and energy momentum tensors are obtained from Noether's theorem. Introducing a quantum postulate in addition to the Maxwell's equations, electromagnetic fields in bianisotropic media are quantized."
"Circuit requirements, as well as practical realizations, are discussed for different types of electronic wristwatches, namely, the spring-balance, tuning-fork, and quartz-crystal-controlled movements. Particular emphasis is placed on the oscillator, frequency divider, and motor-drive circuits for quartz watches. Bipolar integrated circuits are well adapted for oscillators and motor-drive circuits producing high current pulses (1 mA). Bipolar frequency dividers with adequate power consumption are possible up to approximately 32 kHz. Complementary MOS circuits offer the important advantages of low consumption and high density of integration. This technology presently appears to be a good solution for advanced watch designs using higher frequency quartz and electronic display systems. The discussion includes a general view of the evolution in this area. For this purpose references are given."
"A steady improvement in electronic computers through nearly two decades has been made possible by continued progress in miniaturization. An obvious question is, What will eventually limit the reduction in size of electronic components? An attempt is made to formulate a quantitative view of some of the phenomena that may limit the extension of present technologies to ever smaller dimensions. Specifically treated are the problems of removing heat from small structures, of the effect of the high resistance of small conductors, and of electromigration. It is concluded that of these the resistive and electromigration effects represent the most significant limits on size, and that they will prevent the dimensions of conductors from being reduced below a few hundred angstrom units."
"Radiation damage is produced in a crystalline target whenever a moving ion transfers sufficient energy to a target atom to displace it from its lattice site. For conditions of practical importance in ion implantation, the radiation damage produced by the injected ions is severe, and the crystal must be carefully Annealed if the chemical effects of the implanted ions are to dominate the residual damage. The purpose of this paper is to review work that has been performed over the past several years in an effort to understand implantation-produced damage and its annealing characteristics, especially in silicon. The subject is developed as follows. A qualitative description of the damage produced by an implanted ion is presented in Section I, followed by a partial inventory of the basic defects that are found in ion-implanted silicon (Section II). The structure of individual damage clusters produced by both heavy and light ions is then described in Section III, where theoretical predictions are compared to a variety of experimental data. This is followed with a section on the depth distribution of defects and damage clusters (Section IV); and the paper is then concluded with a section on the annealing characteristics of implantation-produced damage (Section V). The development is organized to give primary emphasis to those facts and ideas that are essential for applications of ion implantation in the fabrication of MOS and junction devices in silicon. A future paper will review the state of the art in compound semiconductors."

"The bottleneck in extracting data from photographs of the high-energy reactions of subnuclear particles has been opened by a factor of ten in the last decade. Four types of film processors have become operational and they have added to the natural excitement of the field by providing ample events to answer questions about the behavior of subnuclear particles. The method of extraction of track-chamber data by specialists is presented; hardware and software are reviewed. Bubble chambers provide the biggest challenge. Higher energy regions and new optical track chambers indicate further challenges for event-recognition systems."
"The electroencephalogram (EEG), the blood pressure wave, and the electrocardiogram (ECG), produce patterns that the eye of the physician has empirically correlated with important aspects of health. Digital computer techniques for the recognition of these patterns are made particularly difficult by the realities of pattern context sensitivity, frequent signal artifact, real-time operation, finite storage limitations, and reasonable cost. Evaluations of these techniques are handicapped by the absence of absolute standards, the wide signal variability associated with pathologic states, and the sheer mechanics of comparison with human analysis. Computer analysis of the EEG has been directed toward monitoring sleep and certain pathologic states, leaving the more difficult problem of diagnosis to the trained neurologist. Automatic pattern recognition of the blood pressure wave has been implemented with straightforward techniques for diagnostic use in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and for monitoring in the intensive care unit. Computer analysis of the ECG has been directed toward morphological and rhythm diagnosis, having great potential utility in clinical heart stations, and toward rhythm monitoring, a most practical application arising in coronary intensive care units. Promising systems are emerging, but years of evaluation and adjustment will be necessary to meet the need for both accuracy and economy."
"A deceptively simple kind of optical pattern recognition deals with print and script. What seemed at one time to be a fairly easy problem area in automated reading of line-like patterns has turned out to be difficult and expensive. The evolution and present state of the art of machine recognition of print and script is examined. On-hand systems relieve large amounts of human drudgery, and both theory and engineering design have advanced greatly in response to pressures caused by our paper explosion. But major problems of cost and effectiveness still exist."
"The United States space program is in the throes of a major shift in emphasis from exploration of the moon and nearby planets to the application of remote sensing technology toward increased scientific understanding and economic exploitation of the earth itself. Over one hundred potential applications have already been identified. Since data from the unmanned Earth Resources Technology Satellites and the manned Earth Resources Observation Satellites are not yet available, the experimentation required to realize the ambitious goals of these projects is carried out through approximation of the expected characteristics of the data by means of images derived from weather satellite vidicon and spin-scan cameras, Gemini and Apollo photographs, and the comprehensive sensor complement of the NASA earth resources observation aircraft. The extensive and varied work currently underway is reviewed in terms of the special purpose scan and display equipment and efficient data manipulation routines required for high-resolution images; the essential role of interactive processing; the application of supervised classification methods to crop and timber forecasts, geological exploration, and hydrological surveys; the need for nonsupervised classification techniques for video compaction and for more efficient utilization of ground-control samples; and the outstanding problem of mapping accurately the collected data on a standard coordinate system. An attempt is made to identify among the welter of \"promising\" results areas of tangible achievement as well as likely bottlenecks, and to assess the contribution to be expected of digital image-processing methods in both operational and experimental utilization of the forthcoming torrent of data."
"Starting with the era of learning machines, reasons are presented for the current emergence of graphics-oriented interactive pattern analysis and classification systems (IPACS) as a general approach to practical pattern-recognition problems. A number of representative systems and their application to a wide variety of patterns are surveyed. Various aspects of alternative hardware and software implementations are commented upon and computational algorithms and mappings relevant to interactive analysis and classification of patterns are discussed."
"Since the computer technology utilized often places limitations on the performance of a particular pattern-recognition task, it is important to compare the state-of-the-art and future trends in both the digital and the analog-computer fields. Electronic, acoustical, and optical analog computers for use in pattern recognition are discussed and their performance compared with that of both general-purpose and special-purpose digital computers. It is shown that the analog computer offers workers using low-precision high-speed one-dimensional or two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis a significant advantage in hardware performance (equivalent bits per second per dollar) over the digital computer in certain limited but important areas. These areas include fingerprint identification, word recognition, chromosome spread detection, earth-resources and land-use analysis, and broad-band radar signal processing. A trend analysis is presented which indicates that the advantages of analog computation will probably be overcome in the next few decades by the rapid performance advances being made in digital-computer hardware."

"Computer-communication systems appear essential to meeting many needs in our society resulting from greater interdependence and complexity of operation and from rising expectations. There are, in principle, different ways of utilizing them for the same purposes, with radically different social consequences. The choice, which amounts in effect to a social decision, is, in practice, severely restricted by the computer hardware and software and by the communication facilities that happen to be available at the time. The paper discusses some of the pressures that lead to more widespread use of computers in the operation of society and illustrates how specific characteristics of computer-communication systems may influence social trends and, in particular, individual freedom."
"The rapid growth of computer communications in recent years has brought with it a number of difficult and controversial regulatory and economic problems. As the government agency responsible for the regulation of interstate common-carrier communications, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been faced with many of these issues. This paper attempts to focus, in a tutorial fashion, upon four areas in the computer-communications field in which the influence of the FCC has been particularly significant. An overview of the regulatory process is given as background, after which we discuss the regulation of commercial computer-communications services, the interconnection of subscriber equipment to the telephone network, the creation of specialized communications carriers and of domestic satellite systems, and finally a number of data communications pricing problems which have arisen as a result of these developments."
"The rapid development of several different kinds of terminals and the greater ease that they offer for the use of real-time on-line systems are having a major impact on the computer industry and on computer applications. Trends that influence the increasing utilization of terminals are identified. The major subsets of the terminal market include keyboard/printer terminals, CRT terminals, \"smart\" terminals, remote-batch terminals, real-time data acquisition and control terminals, transaction and point-of-sale terminals, and several miscellaneous types of less frequently used terminals. Applications, characteristics, and some design considerations are discussed for each of these types of terminals. The important relationship between terminal capability and communications requirements is analyzed. To the extent that stored program capability in the terminal permits part of the task to be performed locally, communication of data between terminal and central communication can be reduced with a consequent reduction in communication costs and increase in overall system reliability."
"The rapidly rising need for computer communications has been met for the most part by utilization of the ever expanding network of voice-bandwidth channels. Transmission of digital signals over these analog channels involves a modem for modulation and demodulation of a voice-frequency carrier. The usual forms of amplitude, frequency, and phase modulations are described together with their basic characteristics, such as efficiency of bandwidth utilization. The principles of signal shaping and filtering for optimum signal-to-noise performance and minimization of intersymbol interference are discussed. Also covered are methods of synchronization, carrier recovery, effects of channel impairments, and the application of automatic equalization. The choice among modem designs is shown to be influenced by bit speed requirement, permissible error rate, type of channel, receiver startup characteristic, and tradeoff between modem and line costs. The functions of the usual transmission and control leads between a data modem and a data terminal are described, and examples are given of leased private-line and switched telecommunications network applications. A current look at the physical aspects of voice-band modems is given and future trends are considered."
"In this paper the nature of errors on telephone data communications channels and the basic techniques for dealing with these errors are discussed. Results of measurements recently taken on dialed connections are reviewed, and it is observed that conventional random-error- or burst-error-correcting codes cannot assure reliable communication on these channels. More generally, it is shown qualitatively that automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) systems are inherently better suited to the task than forward-error-control (FEC) systems. The throughput, or effective data rate, of ARQ systems is discussed, and two basic types of ARQ systems, stop-and-wait and continuous, are compared. It is concluded that with the more common stop-and-wait system, the throughput is unsatisfactory in applications involving high transmission rates and/or long propagation delays. A brief summary of error-correcting codes suitable for use on telephone channels (when a return channel is not available for ARQ) is included. Finally, hybrid schemes where FEC systems are embedded within ARQ systems are briefly discussed."
"An exposition of the basic principles underlying data communication line control procedures is presented. Two specific line controls are then described, with special attention given to their embodiments of these principles."
"Obtaining a cost-effective teleprocessing network is postulated on efficient utilization of the communication links and processing equipment. A variety of line-sharing devices and procedures are commonly used for this purpose. The functional, economic, and application aspects of frequency-division multiplexing (FDM), synchronous time-division multiplexing (STDM), asynchronous time-division multiplexing (ATDM), message switching concentration (MSC), and line (or circuit) switching techniques are discussed. The motivations for line sharing stem from economies of scale in the cost of bandwidth and from the traffic smoothing effect which such devices produce when serving a large terminal population characterized by unscheduled requests for service. The discussion of these techniques includes a detailed contrast between multiplexing and concentration, two terms which are often (and unfortunately) used synonymously. It is shown that FDM and STDM are examples of conventional multiplexing, whereas message switching and line switching usually illustrate concentration. ATDM is shown to be a hybrid line-sharing scheme embodying certain features of both concepts. Thus it is often referred to as statistical multiplexing. The first part of the paper is devoted to a functional explanation of the various concepts referenced above. The balance of the paper is concerned with applications and systems-design considerations involving multiplexing and concentration techniques. The application section focuses on important economic factors pertaining to the selection and use of the various methods. The role of line-sharing devices in contemporary common-carrier and end-user networks is also considered. The economic and technical aspects of these contrasting application environments are emphasized and illustrate the multiplicity of uses for line-sharing devices. The concluding portion of the paper includes a discussion of system-design considerations. This section illustrates precisely how the decision to use multiplexers or concentrators in a typical computer-communication network is implemented. Various techniques for geographically positioning multiplexers and concentrators to minimize total costs are presented. The use of one of these procedures is demonstrated using a typical design problem as a case study."
"A review is given of the use of small digital computers for the processing of data received over communication lines. A detailed discussion is presented of the hardware and software requirements of front-end processors, network processors, remote data concentrators, and message switching systems. Finally, the desirable features common to all communications processors are analyzed. Examples of actual applications are given, so that a realistic basis can be established for the determination of the features which should be included in the design of new communication processors."
"A tutorial introduction to the function and construction of communications software in modern teleprocessing systems is presented, Communication functions include network control, message preprocessing and queuing, and error recovery. These functions are provided by the communication subsystem, which includes components of the supervisory system, special-purpose software, and cooperating peripheral processors. The construction of communication subsystems is described, including aspects of both software and hardware, in the context of a multiprogramming and multiprocessing environment. The application of distributed-function processing, virtual memory, and segmentation techniques to the design of these subsystems is discussed."
"This paper describes the U. S. telecommunications network with particular emphasis on aspects that are of importance to data- and computer-oriented services. The major portion of this network is owned and operated by the AT&T Company and the associated operating units of the Bell System as well as the independent branch of the industry. The services which the telephone network offers for data today depend in large part on transmission and switching systems which have evolved over the past decades primarily for voice transmission. An understanding of the history of the growth of the network and its facilities is useful background for the description of the current data services given later in this paper. After the current data services have been outlined, plans for AT&T's new Digital Data System, which utilizes a network of digital carriers for data transmission, will be described."
"Developments in the plans for providing a comprehensive set of dedicated and switched digital services are reviewed. Descriptions are given of the considerations which influence the decisions on the technical solutions to be used to modernize the transmission plant. The description covers long-distance transmission, local distribution, multipoint systems, store-and-forward switching, access from unequipped customers, and circuit switching."
"The Datran system is designed to serve the specific needs of the data communications user. Data communications terminals almost universally employ a digital format; therefore, an early consideration was the use of digital transmission in lieu of the analog transmission employed by most conventional common-carrier systems. The location of the potential users was examined, this having an important bearing on the transmission media selected. Growth expectancy for future years establishes the base upon which to plan the initial system capacity, the hierarchy of system subassemblies for economical modular growth, and phased construction. The employment of digital channel derivation equipment provides a high channel capacity for a given channel bandwidth as compared to analog transmission and permits the use of highly reliable integrated components at a significant reduction in channel end costs. Time-division multiplexing (TDM) switching with a stored program controller provides reliability and flexibility to meet the changing needs of the data communications user and affords significant savings in space, power, and implementation costs of conventional space-division switches."
"This short paper, which serves as an introduction to the four papers that follow it, comments on the plans for international data communications in Europe. It points out that plans for public data networks, while understandably varying from country, to country, have a promising degree of compatibility and commonality."
"The principles of new switched data networks planned in France are explained together with a short survey of the present state of the art. Basic techniques, offered services, compatibility with telephone, envelope concept, synchronization, and international compatibility are covered. The general ideas underlying the outline of its implementation are given but many technical details are still under study both in the French Post, Telegraph, and Telephone (PTT) Administration and in international bodies such as the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT). Such studies, made by various administrations in Europe, should lead to new possibilities by sharing many features which are presently afforded within private networks, but interchange of information between potential users and administrations should throw light on the extent with which many services should be offered."
"The Electronic Data Switching system (EDS) and its introduction into the network of the Federal German Post Office are presented. The great demands of future data transmission will be unable to be met by conventional techniques. Therefore, special networks for data traffic are being discussed in several countries. This paper deals with the plans of the Deutsche Bundespost (Federal German Post Office) to establish a data network by making use of the newly developed EDS system. Furthermore, it describes the individual components of the network, such as the connection of the subscriber and the techniques for transmission, concentrating, and switching. The new network will offer a great number of operational and technical facilities which cannot be provided using conventional techniques. Starting from the present international agreements, the most important operational facilities of the data network are described, and an outlook is given on future synchronous modes of operation with the EDS system."
"At the Central Administration of Swedish Telecommunications, a study of a national public data network has been completed. The network is aimed at accommodating subscriber data-transmission speeds up to 9600 bits/s. The study shows that the network shall be of the synchronous type utilizing circuit-switching techniques with a connection time on the order of 100-200 ms. It shall provide means for accommodating both synchronous and asynchronous subscriber terminal equipment. In the former case, the information flow to and from the subscriber shall be transmitted within a fixed format synchronized by the network. In the latter case the asynchronous data flow shall be converted to a synchronous data flow at a concentrator. Concentrators shall be connected to exchanges via 64-kbit/s time-division multiplexing (TDM) data channels, whereas exchange interconnections shall be via TDM data channels with speeds up to 2.048 Mbits/s. A public data network gives possibilities for: introducing new services; standardizing operational and maintenance network routines; standardizing subscriber procedures; traffic with other public data networks; simplifying customer network buildup; integration with other types of telecommunications. A trial network will be built up in order to test principles and hardware for the public data network."
"Due to the long lifetime of telecommunication equipment, the introduction of new services such as data transmission requires careful long-range planning. Some of the considerations influencing this planning, as seen from a research laboratory in a small country, are presented in this paper. The conclusion is that data communication would best be integrated with a future digital telephone network. Apart from economic advantages, this would open the possibility to design a general-purpose audio-visual terminal for man-to-man and man-machine communication, as a modern replacement for the telephone set."
"Modeling, analysis, and design problems and methodologies for centralized and distributed computer-communication networks are discussed. The basic problem is to specify the location and capacity of each communication link within the network. The design objective is to provide a low-cost network which satisfies constraints on response time, throughput, reliability, and other parameters.

"The development of resource-sharing networks can facilitate the provision of a wide range of economic and reliable computer services. Computer-communication networks allow the sharing of specialized computer resources such as data bases, programs, and hardware. Such a network consists of both the computer resources and a communications system interconnecting them and allowing their full utilization to be achieved. In addition, a resource-sharing network provides the means whereby increased cooperation and interaction can be achieved between individuals. An introduction to computer-to-computer networks and resource sharing is provided and some aspects of distributed computation are discussed."
"Four examples of currently operating computer-communication networks are described in this tutorial paper. They include the TYMNET network, the GE Information Services network, the NASDAQ over-the-counter stock-quotation system, and the Computer Sciences Infonet. These networks all use programmable concentrators for combining a multiplicity of terminals. Included in the discussion for each network is a description of the overall network structure, the handling and transmission of messages, communication requirements, routing and reliability consideration where applicable, operating data and design specifications where available, and unique design features in the area of computer communications."
"The historical development of airlines reservations systems is traced. Characteristics are defined which are those of any real-time, conversational, highly interactive system. The structure of the system is described--agent terminal area, communications facilities, and central site. Lessons learned in the design, development, testing, implementation, and tuning of two generations of systems are discussed. These discussions include initial system design, simulations and systems measurement tools, systems stability and reliability, serial processing, parallel- or multiprocessors, split front-end back-end processing, storage hierarchy, standard and special communications disciplines, and flexibility versus performance. Unlike batch processing the real-time system cannot simply take more run time for a job that has been underestimated. It may well not be able to perform the job at all. Design of these systems is as much an art based on experience as a science and is an iterative process. Systems now being installed have capacities of 180 messages/s, accommodate 10 000 terminals which have access to a 10 billion-byte data base, and provide response times of less than 3 s."
"A technique for improving the convergence of moment-method solutions through the use of a priori knowledge is presented. The idea is that known good approximations such as physical-optics current may be subtracted from the unknown total current with the result that the residual difference current, which is now the quantity to be determined, will converge more rapidly. Use of this method as applied to plane-wave scattering from conducting strips is given as an example."

"A sampling FM demodulator of large bandwidth, consisting of a swept filter and an oscilloscope, is described. The sampled FM function is reconstructed and displayed on an oscilloscope. For a detection bandwidth of 100 MHz and a spectral resolution of 3 MHz (3 percent) the temporal resolution is as high as dv/dt = 1014s-2= 100 MHz/µs in the case of a periodic modulation signal (e.g., flow oscillations). Measurements at an SNR as low as -40 dB, referred to the detection bandwidth, are still possible. Transient FM's can be investigated at a reduced temporal resolution of dv/dt = 3 MHz/µs. The system transfer characteristic is linear to better than 0.5 percent over the whole range and is not affected by the random AM of the Doppler signal. A theoretical analysis and experimental investigations of the system and its application are given."
"The average stress tensor, power-flow density, momentum density, and energy density for electromagnetic waves in a linear stationary anisotropic medium with space and time dispersion are clarified with the help of the second-order nonlinear terms in the equation of motion for polarization. The wave fields are connected with the medium-mass motion through the nonlinear terms; the net force between the fields and the medium mass plays a crucial role in interpreting the stress tensor and the wave momentum. Asymmetry in the space-space part of the energy-momentum tensor, which is quadratic in the field fluctuations, is ascribed to anisotropic restoring forces of the polarizations; asymmetry in the space-time part is attributed to nonvanishing average forces between the fields and the medium-mass motion."
"A versatile solid-state microwave amplifier has evolved from a combination of transistor mechanisms and the transferred-electron effect. The prototype device, called a \"traveling-wave transistor,\" employs a 2-µm layer of n-type GaAs grown epitaxially on a semi-insulating substrate. A transistor-like input launches a traveling space-charge wave that grows exponentially as it moves along the surface to a relatively distant output. There it is converted back into an electromagnetic wave. The long distance between input and output minimizes the feedback capacitance that often limits gain and bandwidth in high-frequency devices. Twelve experimental units show broad-band net gain in X band, with 10-30-dB built-in isolation. One unit exhibits instantaneous net gain from 6.7 to 15.3 GHz; another yields 28 dB at 9.2 GHz. All devices are good for linear microwave signal processing: voltage-controlled phase modulation at constant net gain, or voltage-controlled gain modulation at constant phase. Different bias conditions make possible threshold-sensitive saturated-amplitude amplification of pulses or sinusoids for logic or digital functions."
"Motivated by recent developments in acoustic surface waves, a new approach is presented for the systematic analysis and description of acoustic wave phenomena in isotropic solids. This approach employs certain microwave network techniques developed in the context of electromagnetic waveguides. Acoustic wave structures are viewed as being composed of constituent waveguide regions coupled by junctions or ending in terminations; the waveguide regions are described in terms of equivalent transmission lines and the junctions or terminations by lumped equivalent networks. These transmission lines and equivalent networks contain electrical symbols and are cast into pictorial forms familiar in electrical engineering, but they represent purely acoustical quantities and effects. A rigorous transmission-line formalism is presented for acoustic wave propagation in uniform isotropic regions, which takes account of the translational invariance, reflection symmetry, and power orthogonality of the modal fields. This formalism is much more than a rephrasing of acoustic wave phenomena in terms appealing to electrical engineers; it forms the basis for a rigorous and practical procedure for solving complicated acoustic wave problems, and it yields pictorial insight into wave interactions. Despite its recent development, the method has already been applied successfully to several problems of current interest."
"Rigorous equivalent networks are presented in catalog form for a large variety of planar acoustic interfaces between two media. Although these networks are phrased in electrical terms, involving voltage and current and lumped electrical elements, there is nothing electrical in them. The circuits are purely acoustic in content but electrical in form. These networks are consistent with the microwave network approach described in the companion paper [1], which views an overall structure in terms of uniform regions characterized by modal transmission lines and junction regions represented by lumped equivalent networks. The class of junction regions treated here, namely, planar interfaces between different isotropic media, is a very important one since such interfaces occur as basic constituents in many complicated structures which arise in applications as diverse as ultrasonic surface waves and seismology. In acoustics, a fairly involved coupling of waves can occur at these interfaces; in electromagnetics, by contrast, only simple effects arise and the description becomes trivial."
"The energy and power requirements of a class of on-the-road electric vehicles are developed, and acceleration and speed characteristics of such vehicles in urban traffic are discussed. Curves of average speed under different conditions of traffic are presented, as are curves of average power required during acceleration, average power required during cruising, and peak power required. A dc drive system for propulsion of such a vehicle and an ac drive system appropriate for such an application are described. The two kinds of system are then compared, on an economic as well as a technical basis. A procedure for designing an electric vehicle is outlined, pertinent fields in which research and development are needed are listed, and a reference list on electric vehicles is included."
"A theoretical treatment is presented of some of the nonlinear properties of the IMPATT or Read avalanche diode, a negative-resistance semiconductor device that is now coming into wide-spread use for microwave oscillators and power amplifiers. Based upon the somewhat idealized Read model, this theory presents a qualitatively meaningful explanation of certain \"parametric\" effects that are often troublesome to the designers of amplifier and oscillator networks. First, an analytic treatment is given for frequency-conversion effects that appear when the device is strongly driven by one continuous signal, and simultaneously perturbed by a weak signal at another frequency or by noise. From this theory, stability criteria are derived for spurious oscillations of the \"parametric\" type which frequently appear in these devices under large-signal conditions. The noise-generation mechanism is reviewed, and it is shown that the noise is enhanced by strong signals and the spectral distribution is modified by frequency conversion. Some measurements of noise and frequency-conversion gain are presented which indicate substantial qualitative agreement with the theory."
"A technique is described for employing recursive digital moving-target-indicator (MTI) filters in phased array radars without the undesirable transient effects normally encountered in these filters."
"The geometrical theory of diffraction by a curved wire is used to calculate the backscattered field from a circular loop of wire at oblique incidence. The scalar cases of hard and soft wires and the electro-magnetic cases of horizontal and vertical polarization are treated. Graphs of the back-scattered amplitude versus angle of incidence are given for ka = 1, 2, . . ., 9 where k is the propagation constant and a is the loop radius."
"The sampling theorem states that any strictly band-limited signal can be exactly reconstructed from its sample values. This situation is generalized in two directions: signals are considered which are not strictly band-limited and it is supposed that the samples are subject to a certain distortion before being used for signal reconstruction."
"McIntyre has predicted that avalanche noise is strongly dependent on the ionization coefficients of the carriers initiating the avalanche process. Carriers with lower ionization coefficient produce higher avalanche noise. The experimental results described here confirm the theoretical prediction that in silicon, where the ionization coefficient of holes is an order of magnitude smaller than the ionization coefficient of electrons, the avalanche noise generated by the hole current can be as much as two orders of magnitude larger than the avalanche noise generated by electron current."
"A surface-acoustic-wave convolver can correlate a signal waveform by using an appropriate reference only if the signal arrives within a small time range related to the propagation delay in the device. It is shown here that the complete correlation function can be obtained for arbitrary signal timing if the reference waveform is made repetitive."
"The fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm has had widespread influence in many areas of computation since its \"rediscovery\" by Cooley and Tukey [1]. An efficient and accurate method for interpolation of functions based on the FFT is presented. As an application, the generation of the characteristic polynomial in the \"generalized eigenvalue problem\" [2] is considered."

"The physical parameters necessary to achieve high breakdown voltages in planar diodes with metal junction overlay and annular guard rings are considered. The experimental data are derived from p-ν-n structures with ν resistivity greater than 300 Ω . cm and the primary parameters considered are the extent of junction overlay metallization, the effect of lateral junction curvature, the nature of the annular field terminator and its spacing from the overlay, the dielectric thickness beneath the overlay metallization, and the use of auxiliary dielectric material to obviate arcing and desensitize the structure to ambient effects. By appropriate manipulation of these parameters, diode chips with 10-2-cm2junction area were fabricated to leakages less than 1 µA at 1500 V."
"It has been found that a harmonic analysis of the usual power-law transfer characteristic of the JFET does not yield equations which accurately predict the third-harmonic distortion products for short-gate structures. However, if field-dependent mobility in the drain-source channel is taken into consideration in the equations for the drain current, a transfer characteristic is obtained of the form3Z_{D}(1-e^{-r})/ \\Gamma^{2}, where ZDis the normalized channel height and Γ is the field factor. Equations for the distortion products M2and M3, which are derived from this type of characteristic, accurately predict M2and M3for actual devices as a function of physical parameters. Lower limits on the values of M2and M3which can be achieved in a practical JFET are presented."
"An investigation of impact ionization in the high field domains of GaAs Gunn effect devices has been carried out. A method of measuring the number of excess electrons generated per domain transit was developed, based on the measurement of the increase in the valley current from one domain transit to the next while impact ionization is occurring in the domain. This method was used to experimentally determine the carrier generation per domain transit\\Delta n/n_{0}as a function of excess domain potential VDfor three material carrier concentrations. These results are compared to a theoretical calculation of\\Delta n/n_{0}based upon an approximate solution of the continuity equation and invariant domain calculations. The experimental and theoretical results agree to within 2 percent forn_{0} = 3 \\times 10^{14}cm-3and 6 percent forn_{0} = 4 \\times 10^{14}cm-3."
"The usefulness of computer simulation in the empirical design of a simple Gunn diode oscillator was investigated with encouraging results. The optimum design of a 5-GHz oscillator is discussed in detail. The results do not support Copeland'sN/fscaling criterion. It is also shown that a doping profile favoring dipole space-charge formation is not necessarily at a disadvantage when compared with domain-suppressed design."
"A large-signal computer simulation was made for several simplified nonuniform doping profiles that correspond to those of practicalX-band Gunn diode. Maximum available dc-to-RF conversion efficiency was searched for each profile by varying the oscillation frequency and the magnitude of the RF terminal voltage while the dc bias was fixed. The result showed that a higher-resistance cathode-side region degrades the efficiency mainly through decrease of the amplitude of the RF current, while a higher resistance anode-side region degrades the efficiency much more by delaying the phase of the domain nucleation. An improvement of the efficiency by about 20 percent was found to be possible by introducing a low-resistance region near the anode to deform the RF current waveform. Computations were also made for several nonuniform profiles that were observed experimentally. Calculated and experimental results were compared, and reasonable agreement between the two was found, though there were some cases in which the agreement was not obtained due to nonideal properties of electrode boundaries."
"The device described permits threshold acceleration detection in a wide range from a few ten's of g's up to maybe 100 000 g's. It is a threshold sensing device with an extremely high on-to-off resistance ratio. The device consists of a flexible metal beam and an associated contact pad, which is activated by the force of the beam's inertial mass when being accelerated in a direction normal to the contact plane. The mechanical and electrical operation of the accelerometer is analyzed and expressions are given for the relationship between beam deflection, acceleration detection level, and various required beam dimensions. A batch fabrication procedure is demonstrated and acceleration test results up to 8000 g's are reported for multiple ganged accelerometers."
"The temperature drop between a transistor junction and the base of a silicon chip is dependent upon the power to be dissipated as well as the geometry of the device. This problem in three-dimensional heat conduction is analytically solved for boundary conditions which approximate a set of operating conditions. Nondimensional curves and examples summarizing typical solutions have been included to illustrate problem solving techniques."
"A new n-channel silicon MOS transistor is described that can be fabricated with channel lengths of less than 1 µ by using a double-diffusion process similar to that used in bipolar transistor fabrication. The dimensional tolerances are not tighter than those used in the processing of conventional MOS transistors. This device (called D-MOST) shows gain in the GHz range and a noise figure comparable to that of microwave transistors. The fmaxis 10 GHz and the noise figure is 4.0 dB at 1 GHz. A brief theory of the D-MOST is followed by the design considerations for a discrete microwave device. Results from s-parameter measurements in the range of 0.1-2.5 GHz are presented along with graphs showing the gains and the stability factor. A simple equivalent circuit is derived from the measurements. Applications of the D-MOST are described."
"High-temperature multilevel interconnection systems are discussed from a materials fabrication, yield, and circuit performance point of view. Refractory metal interconnections are compared to diffused Si planar runs and heavily doped polycrystalline Si films. Circuit configurations and their relative importance for these material-circuit performance considerations are considered. All of the high-temperature refractory systems will have higher yield and better passivation properties than many low-temperature systems. Metallic interconnections are always best from a circuit performance point of view. The relative difference between the high-temperature systems considered depends on circuit configuration. In particular, high-temperature refractory metal (Mo, W) interconnections which are a natural by-product of the self-registered refractory metal gate MOS technology (RMOS) are superior for memory circuits where long address lines are used."
"Theoretical device simulations and experimental results are presented to show that the origin of an empirical relationship between the bias voltage and transit frequency of CW longitudinal Gunn-effect devices lies in a combination of space-charge propagation effects and thermal effects. The bias current-voltage relationship is considerably altered by the particular details of the device doping profile through average accumulation or depletion effects, as well as by the temperature."
"A study is made of the suitability of the interaction between a thin, solid, spiraling electron beam of 5-15-kV energy and a microwave cavity, for the purpose of generating watts of CW millimeter-wave power. The effect of finite energy spread in the electron beam is considered both theoretically and experimentally. Measured results are given for a prototype device operating at 9.4 GHz. Power outputs of 5 W and electronic efficiencies near 2 percent have been obtained. The data agree well with the theory, subject to some ambiguity in the energy-distribution parameters. The performance is strongly limited by the energy spread in the beam."
"The conical cavity has been modified for use in electron beam devices. In this new cavity resonator a short radial line section couples the beam hole with the conical region providing a suitable interaction gap. Operated in a higher order TM0p0mode the cavity size is large compared to wavelength making it attractive for millimeter or submillimeter applications. In this mode, both Q0and Rshuntare large. For analysis, the modified conical cavity can be considered as a composite consisting of a circular waveguide at cutoff, a radial waveguide, and a shorted \"quasi-wedge\" guide. Resonant frequencies are found by impedance matching at a transverse plane in the cavity. UnloadedQand Rshuntare found by calculating total energy stored and power loss along with an equivalent voltage across the gap. An experimental cavity was tested. This cavity was scaled forXand Ku bands and operated in TM0p0modes from p=5 to p=9. Measured results agreed well with theory. At the p=9 mode, the radial dimension of the cavity was 4.2 λ. Design curves are presented for the modified conical cavity without beam hole."
"The most severe and fundamental performance limitation of the PPM focused TWT has been excessive thermal heating of the RF propagating structure due to some fractional interception of the electron beam. The quality of beam focusing has largely been determined by the characteristics of permanent magnets in the Alnico series. With the introduction of the cobalt-rare earth alloys, a breakthrough in the performance of PPM focused TWTs can be expected. A samarium cobalt focused TWT yielding an output power of 2 kW at 10 percent duty is described. Utilizing a conventional helix slow-wave circuit, the tube covers a multioctave frequency range from 3.5 to 10.6 GHz. Successful operation has been achieved into a load VSWR of 10:1. The magnets are fabricated from powdered cobalt-rare earth alloys by a process sequence that includes powder preparation, magnetic alignment, pressing, sintering, and magnetizing. Energy products in excess of 15×106gauss-oersteds (MGOe) have consistently been achieved for use on this tube."
"A compact model for bipolar transistors (integral charge control model) which includes many high-level effects has recently been developed. This model has been shown to give much more accurate results than the conventional Ebers-Moll model. However, avalanche effects have not been included previously. Here a simple expression is developed for the avalanche current generated in the collector junction of a transistor. Avalanche current calculated from this expression agrees very well with the results of exact numerical calculations, which solve the Poisson equation and continuity equations for a realistic structure. With this simple expression, avalanche effects can be incorporated into the integral charge control model with the addition of three model parameters. Output characteristics have been calculated with such a modified integral charge control model and compare very well with measured results demonstrating the accuracy of the avalanche modeling."
"A photoconductor-electroluminescent type infrared image converter panel has been studied through the application of doped CdSe photoconductive powder layers of different thickness to the earlier type of image converter and through temperature operation. The spectral sensitivity extended from 0.7 to 1.2 µm with sensitivity peak at 0.9 µm and the minimum detectable input power density reached approximately 2×10-10W/cm2for 0.9 µm at 0°C. Projected infrared images are converted to visible electroluminescent images with a resolution of 3 to 8 TV lines/mm and a response time of an order of 1 to 10-2s, depending upon the photoconductor thickness and the operating temperature. The converter panel may be used as a night vision panel with an additional infrared source. This paper describes a preparation of doped CdSe photoconductor suitable for a photoconductor-electroluminescent device, some of its properties, and the effect of the photoconductor thickness and of the operating temperature on the performance of the solid-state infrared image converter. Converted visible images using experimental panels are also shown."
"If a collector in a beam-type tube captures all the electrons at almost zero velocity, the tube efficiency will approach unity. Such a collector might be called a soft-landing collector. This paper describes the principle, design theory, preliminary experimentation, and application of a new type collector in which an almost complete soft landing can be realized. The experimental TWT equipped with this collector achieved an efficiency improvement from 19 to 46 percent."
"A ten-stage electrostatic depressed collector, designed with the aid of an analog computer, was tested on a 1-kW CW 750-MHz klystron. Excellent correlation was achieved between computed and measured performance under varying conditions of RF drive. At full RF power output approximately 60 percent of the spent beam energy was recovered by use of the depressed collector. The net power conversion efficiency of the tube was raised from its undepressed value of 54.3 percent to approximately 70.9 percent. At one-half full power output, a collector efficiency of 70 percent was measured. At zero RF power output collector efficiency was 80 percent. To achieve these results it was necessary to install a small focusing coil between the final drift tube and the collector. No spurious oscillations or instabilities were detected when collector depression was employed, nor was electron backstreaming increased significantly. Intentional short circuiting of adjacent collector electrode pairs was shown to cause only minor degradation in collector performance."

"The difference in thermal expansion causes compression in SiO2thermally grown on Si wafers. Unsupported windows of SiO2buckle if the oxide thickness/window width ratio (t/w) is too small. This correspondence presents the experimentally determined t/w ratio for stable films."
"The CW performance of GaAs transferred electron oscillators (TEO) is described. The TEO were fabricated from n+-n-n+epitaxial structures of GaAs grown from the vapor phase. The devices consisted of single mesas, 5-6 mil in diameter, on plated silver heat sinks. Fifteen devices were fabricated from three separate wafers and the results were very uniform. The dc to RF efficiency varied between 4 and 5.7 percent for the 15 devices packaged and tested. The best results were 350 and 390 mW of RF power with a conversion efficiency of 5.4 and 5.7 percent, respectively, at approximately 17.5 GHz from single 5.5-mil mesas. These data represent new highs in performance from single-mesa TEO at this frequency. The results indicate that vapor epitaxial growth procedures combined with a device fabrication scheme based on plated heat sink technology can yield reproducible TEO with RF powers greater than 250 mW at efficiencies greater than 5 percent. The results indicate also that the plated heat sink approach will be useful for other devices, such as IMPATTS, in which thermal considerations limit device performance."
"The difficulty in obtaining CW oscillations in GaAs planar Gunn diodes has been found to be due to distortion of the field distribution by a field-enhanced trapping effect. A tapered active region is proposed to compensate for the effect due to the trapping. By adopting the geometry, coherent CW Gunn oscillations have been obtained successfully with reasonable reproducibility."
"Recent experimental work on current instabilities and related properties of n-type germanium in high electric fields shows several kinds of instabilities. The purpose of this paper is to show that the differences can be explained by assuming different boundary conditions at the cathode. The method of analysis follows that of Conwell."

 "A method is presented that allows deep level density and energy of impurities in semiconductors to be routinely determined from simpleC-Vmeasurements of Schottky barriers. The method is particularly useful for material having levels with very long time constants that are not accessible by noise spectra measurements. The technique is illustrated by measurements of epitaxial n-GaAs which show a donor level at 0.83 eV below the conduction band."
"The standard expression for the off-axis fields in terms of the axial values and their differentials is examined. It is shown that if terms higher than the second are used, the accuracy becomes worse instead of better, unless the input data are mathematically perfect. It is not possible to remedy this by smoothing experimental data with a polynomial curve-fitting routine. Alternative expressions of the fields in terms of Legendre polynomials and of elliptic integrals are considered. It is shown that the elliptic integral method is the most convenient in practical cases, and a fast computer routine is given for the required K and E. In this method, the fields are defined by the parameters of a set of current loops, and the problem of finding these parameters is discussed. No general solution can be given, but a considerable class of cases is reduced to an explicit solution of a cubic equation by Cardan's method. It is shown that hybrid methods can also be used; the data is first represented by a set of current loops. A precise set of axial values is calculated from these loops, and the differential routine can then be used with acceptable accuracy, including terms up to the sixth order."
"The optical gain and spectral response of heterojunction phototransistors with wide-gap emitters have been examined theoretically in idealized cases. The optical gain is found to be closely related to the current gain in the common-emitter configuration β of a heterojunction transistor. Because of Kroemer's factor, the injection efficiency of the emitter junction is very high, resulting in a high β or a large optical gain. However, β or the optical gain is limited by the base transport efficiency when the injection efficiency is extremely high. From the analyses, the optical gains and spectral responses of an n.GaAs-p. Ge-n.Ge heterojunction phototransistor and n-p-n homojunction phototransistors of GaAs and of Ge are numerically computed. It becomes evident that the heterojunction phototransistor has a higher optical gain and a wider spectral response (\\sim5 \\times 10^{5}at wavelengths ranging from 0.9 to 1.5 µm) than either of the homojunction phototransistors."
"Measured noise temperatures for argon discharges at pressures from 1 to 40 mmHg in tubes with 0.63-cm inner radius are presented. In general, the results agree with theoretical electron temperatures, but disagree with previously published data for similar pressure-radius products. It is suggested that similarity rules should be applied with caution. Large audio-frequency disturbances were found to originate in the anode region at all pressures; variations in the plasma impedance were synchronized with these disturbances."
"This analysis of noise behavior is based on an equivalent circuit for the junction field-effect transistor (FET) that was previously published [10]. Since all noise sources in this equivalent circuit are uncorrelated and all significant parasitic elements are already considered, one may apply an easy and direct calculation for the noise factor, which is carried out for the common source, common gate, and common drain configurations. As a result, the constant noise factor contours are represented as circles in the plane of the complex source admittance Y8. This plot of circles is valid above 1/f noise up to moderately high frequencies, and is arrived at by a frequency-dependent normalization of the axis. It is shown that the plot is fully characterized by two frequency-dependent values: the optimum source admittanceY_{8} {opt}and the minimum noise factor Fmin, both being derived from the small-signal equivalent circuit of the FET and the bias condition. The results are in agreement with the commonly held opinion that the noise factor does not differ very much for the three basic configurations [9]. Finally, the theoretical results are verified by measurements at 30 and 60 MHz."
"An experimental investigation has clarified the nature of both fundamental and harmonic extraction from p+-n-n+avalanche diodes operated in the trapped-plasma mode. A standard coaxial cavity was found to be suitable for low-order (n\\leq5) harmonic generation. Calculations revealed that the circuit behaved as a bandpass filter which allowed power to be extracted at a particular output harmonic while \"reactively\" terminating the diode at other harmonics. Measurements were made of external current anddV/dtwaveforms for illustrative cases of fundamental and low-order harmonic extraction. IntegrateddV/dtwaveforms exhibited overvoltages which increased with increasing peak displacement currents. In general, the duration of the plasma-removal period of high current increased with increasing overvoltage. Carroll's [16] suggested dichotomy of voltage waveforms into independent reactive and resistive components was found to be appropriate for optimum first and second harmonic extraction. For third, fourth, and fifth harmonic extraction, however, it was observed that optimum efficiency was associated with significant changes in the physical states of the diode. Fourier analysis of the integrateddV/dtwaveforms for low-order harmonic extraction revealed that maximum voltage amplitudes occurred at the harmonic being extracted. Combination ridge waveguide coaxial cavities were used for high-order harmonic extraction inXandKband. A far-infrared interferometer detected components in the power spectrum from theK-band cavity at frequencies up to 40 GHz. It was found empirically that, to first order, the optimum observed extraction efficiency was equal to 50 percent/ (harmonic number)."
"A new bipolar integrated circuit structure has been fabricated that compares favorably to the MOS structure in terms of fabrication simplicity and performance. The new structure is basically a modified isolated lateral transistor and requires only three photolithographic masking operations up to and including first level of metalization. The fabrication of the structure is as follows: a shallow nonselective p-type base region is diffused into a lightly doped p-type substrate; n+emitter and collector regions are then simultaneously and selectively diffused into and through the p-type base region thus forming a lateral n-p-n transistor. The second and third masks define the contact holes and the metalization pattern, respectively. Lateral isolation of the structure is obtained by encircling the emitter and base regions with the collector region. Vertical isolation is achieved by the large collector-depletion region that extends beneath the emitter and base regions. Since the substrate is lightly doped a low collector voltage will adequately isolate the emitter and base regions from adjacent devices. The new technology permits the fabrication of transistors, resistors, and crossunders. Transistors with 2-to 3-µm spacings occupy 500 µm2of silicon area and have the following characteristics:\\beta = 35, peakf_{t} = 0.1GHz at 0.5 mA, BV(SUSTAIN) = 3 to 5 V,t_{r} = 20ns,t_{f} = 120ns,t_{s} = 20ns. Resistors with values as high as 40 kΩ have been fabricated within 600 µm2. Active nonlinear loads with effective resistance up to 200 kΩ have been fabricated. TTL gates have been made with power-delay products of 3.6 pJ, and propagation delays of 34 ns."
"Economy of integrated circuit fabrication in the presence of quasi-randomly distributed spot defects is described. The distribution of the defects is represented in terms of density and modeled as follows : 1) they are randomly distributed within a limited area; 2) the density in a wafer changes concentrically; and 3) the density is normally distributed from wafer to wafer with uniform deviation throughout a wafer. The yield degradation phenomenon due to such defects has been analyzed using a computer simulation technique. The effect of density variations in a wafer and between wafers has been mainly investigated. An extensive numerical study leads to the following conclusions. 1) The deviation of the yield versus chip-area relation from the simple exponential law is influenced more greatly by the nonuniform defect distribution in a wafer than by the density variation between wafers. 2) The increase of average yield due to the density variation between wafers is sometimes offset by the decrease of the accuracy in yield prediction. Process stabilization is essential for the economical production of a few large-scale chips."
"The effects of insulator thickness fluctuations on the charge storage characteristics of MNOS direct tunneling devices were investigated, using capacitor structures carefully fabricated by depositing Si3N4layers on thermally grown SiO2films. The oxide films were thin enough (∼27 Å) for the electron transfer due to electrical pulsing to occur via direct tunneling through them (the SiO2films). Both the Si3N4and SiO2layers were prepared deliberately with a thickness gradient across the silicon substrates, and the thickness of each dielectric was ellipsometrically profiled to within ±1 percent accuracy. In this way the effect of insulator thickness deviations from nominal values could be experimentally evaluated under virtually identical processing conditions. Experimental results in these capacitor specimens indicate that other things being equal, a small thickness fluctuation causes a significant flat-band potential spread (or an equivalent threshold voltage spread in actual MNOSFET structures) in the pulsed devices. In the range of practical interest for charge storage devices, this spread can be substantial if the thickness deviations exceed ±1 Å for the SiO2films or, equivalently, ±40 Å for the Si3N4films. For a typical Al-Si3N4(400 Å)-SiO2(20-25 Å)-Si structure, for example, a ±2 Å fluctuation can result in a 2- to 4-V spread of the Si flat-band potential after charging, depending on the pulse height used. In the microsecond range of switching time, such threshold spreads will reduce the so- called flat-band hysteresis window from 6 to 2 V typically-which is detrimental to device performance. A simple analysis is given to show that the thickness fluctuation effect in MNOSFET devices can be predicted semi-empirically, using the charging characteristics of a device having the nominal insulator thicknesses."
"The analysis of the meander-line type of traveling-wave deflection system shows that the deficiency in the dispersion characteristics is due to the interaction of the electromagnetic field on a section of a finger with that on other fingers. Insertion of a shielding plate between two neighboring sections of the fingers reduces mutual interactions. The meander line with the shielding plate is called the trough-type traveling-wave deflection system. The analysis shows that uniform characteristics of the dispersion and the admittance with respect to the frequency are expected in the trough-type traveling-wave deflection system. Loading by the dielectric material of the space among electrodes serves to decrease the phase velocity and to increase the deflection sensitivity. In the experimental CRT in which the trough-type traveling-wave deflection system is used, a uniform sensitivity is confirmed experimentally in the frequency range from dc to above 4 GHz and the deflection of 6 mm by 10-mW input is measured."
"There are two contributions to the drain-source leakage current in MOS field-effect transistors for gate voltages below the extrapolated threshold voltage (Vtx) : 1) reverse-bias drain junction leakage current, and 2) a surface channel current that flows when the surface is weakly inverted. Nearly six orders of magnitude of drain-source current from the background limit imposed by the drain junction leakage to the lower limits of detection of most curve tracers (0.05 µA) are controlled by gate-source voltages below the extrapolated threshold voltage. It is shown that this current flows only for gate voltages above the intrinsic voltage Vi, the gate voltage at which the silicon surface becomes intrinsic. For gate voltages between Viand Vtxthe surface is weakly inverted with the resulting channel conductivity being responsible for the drain-source current \"tails\" observed for gate voltages below Vtx. The importance of the intrinsic voltage in designing low-leakage CMOS and standard PMOS circuitry is discussed."
"The design of low-noise IMPATT diodes has been aided by theories describing the noise generation under small-signal conditions. A major deficiency in this procedure has existed in that there is no apparent connection between the small-signal behavior and the great increases in the noise observed in large-signal operation. As a remedy a theory has been developed for the noise generation at arbitrary signal levels by using a Read diode model. The theory is based on a linearization technique for calculating the spectrum of homogeneous noise with linear damping resulting in a separation of the large-signal and noise problems. The open-circuit noise voltage increases strongly at high signal levels due to nonlinear parametric interactions and gives rise to a rapid increase in the noise measure as a function of the generated microwave power. Operating parameters are derived that optimize the power-noise ratio. A long intrinsic response time is found to be beneficial in achieving high power as well as low noise. Other factors affecting the design and choice of material for IMPATT diodes are discussed. An important feature of the presented theory is that a complete design optimization with respect to the power-noise characteristics can be carried out provided reliable information exists about the ionization rates and the drift velocities. A simpler alternative is to obtain the physical quantities governing the power-noise behavior from small-signal admittance and noise measurements. Good agreement has been obtained with experimental power-noise measurements by this method. As an application of this procedure a state of the art comparison is given for GaAs, Ge, and Si diodes at 6 GHz."
"A thin solid-state X-ray panel of sandwich-type structure using photoconductive (PC) and semiconducting electroluminescent (EL) powder layers has been developed. The PC layer and the semiconducting EL layer are connected electrically in series. Both ac and dc voltages are applied across the combination. The X-ray sensitivity of the converter depends on the dc voltage drop across the PC powder layer and on input X-ray intensity. Gamma and input latitude of the converter performance are widely controllable by adjusting the dc voltage applied across the panel. The ac supplies excitation for the EL phosphor. The light output intensity at a low X-ray intensity level is substantially improved without deteriorating the picture resolution. For X-ray intensity of 30 mR/min, 80 kV peak, the converter produces light output about 800 times as bright as a conventional fluoroscope screen does, and Mo wire of 200-µm diameter is observed. However, seconds are required for image buildup and cutoff. Converted X-ray images using an experimental converter are also shown."
"Expressions for the time average energy flow are derived for a linear physical system with an arbitrary number of interacting waves. The system is assumed to be temporally and spatially dispersive and to include losses. Waves constant in time but growing or decaying in space with arbitrarily large factors are considered. The results are used to discuss the energy flow components in a traveling-wave tube and in a piezoelectric semiconductor device."
"The creation of interface states and the trapping of charge in the oxide during avalanche breakdown of the emitter-base (e-b) junction of planar transistors was studied. Two types of n-p-n transistors, differing in the amount of boron in the base region, were investigated. The creation of interface states was largest in the transistors with a higher concentration of boron in the base region, probably due to a higher density of avalanche plasma near the Si-SiO2interface. The amount of negative charge trapped in the oxide during breakdown with a positive voltage applied to a field plate above the e-b junction was found to be related to the magnitude of the current through the oxide during breakdown. This current is obviously due to hot electrons injected into the oxide. A fraction of these electrons is trapped with about the same efficiency in both types of transistors."
"The oscillation mechanism of the avalanching region of the IMPATT diode is clarified by referring to the cavity resonator and feedback theories. When the avalanche takes place, the microwave electric field and the particle currents grow spacially. But the spacial growth does not directly mean the self-oscillation, as there exists the reflection loss at the region edges. When the gain due to the avalanche exceeds the reflection loss, the self-oscillation can take place. The preceding phenomena are analyzed by the conception of the open-loop transfer gain in feedback theory."
"A high-purity n-type indium antimonide sample mounted in a reentrant cavity and cooled to 4.2°K was operated as a millimeter-wave detector. The scheme utilizes a downconversion process and free-carrier absorption is the mechanism responsible for the detection process. Power applied at the millimeter-wave frequency causes a change in the material conductivity which in turn causes a change in theX-band power absorption; cavity perturbation techniques are used to analyze the scheme. The detector was operated successfully at frequencies between 35 and 150 GHz with no long wavelength or short wavelength cutoff observed. The scheme offers a fast highly sensitive and rugged detector with low conversion loss."
"Voltage variable capacitors have been fabricated using ion implantation and a PtSi Schottky barrier to obtain a high degree of control over the doping in a hyperabrupt diode structure. Three methods for obtaining the desired doping in the hyperabrupt region have been investigated, including diffusion from a low energy predeposition and higher energy implantations with no diffusion. TheC-Vcharacteristics for two different profiles, made using diffusion to drive in an ion predeposition, agree well with theoretical calculations if a Gaussian diffusion profile peaked at the surface is assumed(D = 2.38 \\times 10^{-13}cm2/s for phosphorus at 1100°C in an oxygen ambient). It has been found that the device parameter spread of about 7 percent is dominated by nonuniformities in the donor concentration of the epitaxial layer. Parameter variations due to sources other than the epitaxial layer doping are about 3 percent. Low-dose channeling implantations have been made to tailor the profile such that the sensitivity-(dC/C)(V/dV) is nearly constant"
"A theoretical low-frequency noise model for the epitaxial-channel surface field-effect structure is presented where random modulation of the channel conductance arises from fluctuation of charges trapped at the oxide trap states near the Si-SiO2interface. In this model, charge fluctuation in the oxide traps arises from carrier tunneling between the fast interface surface states and the oxide trap states. A second fluctuation, at higher frequencies, arises from the random thermal emission and capture of electrons and holes at the fast interface states through the thermal or Shockley-Read-Hall process. Different oxide trap densities were introduced into the interface region of the metal-oxide-silicon field-effect structures using a carefully controlled and reproducible oxygen heat treatment technique. Energy distributions of the oxide trap densities are obtained from capacitance measurements. Humps are observed between the flat band and the onset of strong surface inversion (lower half of the bandgap) in both the noise power and the oxide trap density versus gate voltage (or surface band bending) plots. Theoretical noise power calculations using the experimental oxide trap density profile from the capacitance-voltage data agree very well with the experimental noise humps in both magnitudes and fine structures. It is shown that the frequency spectra of noise depend strongly on the oxide trap density profile in the oxide. It is suggested that the oxide traps are due to the excess oxygen at the SiO2-Si interface."
"In evaluating the electron drift velocity at Si avalanche, the electron distribution is obtained by solving the Boltzmann transport equation in the maximum anisotropy truncation (MAT) approximation of Baraff. Improvements are made to the MAT procedure so that the symmetrical part of the distribution function can be obtained in a straightforward manner. The temperature dependence of electron drift velocity is studied by including both optical phonon emission and absorption rather than emission alone. The calculated electron drift velocity varies from1 \\times 10^{7}to2.9 \\times 10^{7}cm/s at Si avalanche."
"Results are presented to support the contention that the memory properties of MNOS and MNS devices are due to crystalline areas in the nitride. The memory effect was found to disappear when the crystalline areas were removed by ion implantation techniques."
"The pressure and frequency dependences of threshold voltage and delay time in chalcogenide glasses have been analyzed by means of a previously developed thermal model. Good agreements with experimental observations confirm further the speculation of thermally assisted switching in semiconducting glasses. In addition, a brief discussion on several aspects of the postswitching phenomena, using the same approach, has also been given."

"Results of an investigation into the triggering of linear xenon flashlamps are presented, with particular reference to xenon flashlamps in laser applications. Measurements are described which give information on the arc formation process, trigger voltage thresholds, peak trigger currents, lamp energy output stability, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) for both series and parallel triggering. Particular attention is given to the performance obtained with both the correct and the incorrect polarities for the two types of triggering. The investigation makes extensive use of a high-speed streak camera and a wideband (100 MHz) continuous sweep spectrum analyzer, as well as more conventional instrumentation. It was found that: 1) the triggering process is extremely fast (≤50 ns) for both methods, but that parallel triggering produces trigger currents which are 100 times smaller than series; 2) the trigger current rather than the main energy, discharge current is the dominant EMI source; 3) the measured RF spectra show the corresponding EMI superiority of parallel over series; and 4) the two methods are equivalent in regard to the effect on lamp efficiency and stability."
"The threshold voltage of \"normally off\" Si-MESFET's for simple dc-coupled circuits is defined and computed with a two-dimensional device model, taking into account carrier velocity saturation and diffusion. The influence of the main parameters, gate length, conducting-layer thickness, and doping is investigated outside the range of Shockley's equations. A threshold voltage of a MESFET with a 1-µm gate lengthU_{T} = 0.2V±10 percent requires a conducting-layer thickness toleranced =0.15µm±3 percent."
"The effects of a nonuniform magnetic field on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channel flow between two parallel plates of infinite extent are investigated. Influence of the induced magnetic field, such that the magnetic Reynolds number is less than unity but greater than zero, is included. The goal is to use the MHD effects to reduce the amount of heat transfer from the fluid to the channel walls. Expressions for distortion in the magnetic and flow fields are obtained. A solution is then obtained using the perturbation theory in the expansion of the field components in a double-power series in RmandI. The pressure gradient along the channel wall is examined. A criterion is developed under which Rmmust be taken into account in determining the heat transfer between the fluid and the channel walls."
"An iterative error-minimizing multiparameter computer technique is used to establish values for a six-parameter model of a metal-GaAs barrier based on measurements of temperature, current and the voltage split resulting from rectification at the contact. The most important feature of the technique is that it is not necessary to make assumptions regarding contact area, effective electron mass, and barrier heights. Rather, these parameters emerge from the computation as best-fitting computed values. The agreement between the computed contact area and the known physical electrode area is taken as an indicator of the validity of the procedure and of the consistency of the experimental data. Thermionic-field emission theory is proved quantitatively correct using this technique. Also, this technique constitutes a new method of establishing the value of the effective electron mass. For GaAs m* = 0.0677."
"In this brief review paper analytical results concerning the low-frequency (LF) amplifier noise performance of FET's are presented. The effects of interaction between the device basic noise sources, the small-signal model parameters, and the signal source admittance parameters are clearly indicated. The noise performance is found to be essentially determined by the effective surface-state density and the gate insulator thickness product (N_{ss}t_{ox}) in the case of MOSFET's, whereas in the case of JFET's, this is determined by the bulk density of impurity and/or defect generation-recombination (g-r) centers within the depletion region and the half-channel height squared product (N_{TT}a^{2}). Although an increase in the gate electrode area can reduce the equivalent gate noise resistance, this does not improve the noise performance of the device. Quantitative results based on typical device parameters are graphically presented with proper indications as to the upper limit of the LF range, the excess minimum noise figure, and the frequency range within which the noise figure remains below 3 dB level for specified source resistance values. The effects of gate leakage current on the noise performance of JFET's are included in these results."
"Properties of current pulses in low-conductivity planar bulk GaAs containing Cu and Fe were investigated, and the generation mechanism of the pulses are discussed. Both the amplitude and period of the current pulses depend upon the applied voltage. The pulse is strongly influenced by the illumination of specimens with light of a tungsten lamp. The period of the current pulses cannot be related to the transit time of the electrons between the two electrodes. The phenomenon can be understood qualitatively by periodic excitation and trapping processes of electrons in deep impurity levels."
"Multichannel junction-gate field-effect transistors and their advantages were introduced in 1964 under the name Gridistor. This included both vertical and horizontal channel structures. They were developed in order to combine in the same device the advantages of field-effect and bipolar transistors. The horizontal channel structure had performance which was quite useful in the power VHF band, but it was clear that for the higher frequency and power region the vertical channel structure would be basically more suitable. However, to develop this structure for the microwave power region an exhaustive investigation had to be undertaken with a view toward eliminating its drawbacks, namely the relatively high grid resistance and also differential drain conductance. The first problem was solved by modifying the grid geometry and increasing the grid bulk impurity concentration, and the second by providing an appropriate gradation of the source and drain layer resistivities. Thus, with the usual technology and moderate grid fineness, but with optimized grid geometry, an operating frequency above 1 GHz was attained, fmaxbeing ∼5 GHz, with a frequency-power product of ∼5 GHz. W for a single-chip Gridistor. The features of the devices produced are discussed and a complete set of experimental results is provided. Finally, new developments now being initiated with the expectation of attaining in the near future an operating frequency of 8 GHz in the power region of 1 to 2 W are outlined. An anticipated structure, which will approach the ultimate limits of the Gridistor, is also discussed. This paper deals only with the experimental part of the problems concerning the Gridistor."
"The growth of a space charge in bulk GaAs with a uniform doping profile but with a highly and three-dimensionally non-uniform electric field has been analyzed by introducing a concept of a \"carrier current tube.\" From this analysis it has been shown how the behavior (i.e., growth or decay) of a small space charge depends upon the magnitude of an initial space charge, the nonuniformity of the field, and the dielectric relaxation time and that a space charge grows where the electric field changes along the carrier current even if no initial space charge exists. The \"lateral spreading velocity\" of a dipole domain has been estimated (its value is the order of 108cm/s) and its dependence upon the magnitude of an initial domain has been made clear. Furthermore, computer simulation have been performed for bulk GaAs devices with two-dimensional structure, such as a planar electrode, a nonuniform doping profile, and an imperfect cathode notch. The process of two-dimensional dipole domain formation in these devices has been made clear."
"A thin wire inside a bulk semiconductor can concentrate the current density and the magnetic field strength to intensities that are significant for the Hall effect. Also, the self-magnetic field of the Hall currents can add to this intensification, particularly when there is axial symmetry and a toroidal configuration. The impedanceZiacross the ends of the wire is modified if a currentIflows between the semiconductor and the wire:|Zi| \\simeq \\omega / \\sigma . K_{H}. I[(b/a)^{k} -1]wherek = \\micro .\\sigma . K_{H}.I/(2.\\pi)andaandbare the inner and outer radii of a cylinder. A more complete analysis of the cylindrical field problem reveals that well-known results for skin effect are also modified by the current. The new solution is expressed by high-order Thompson functions, which include the ber and bei functions of skin effect as a special case. For values ofkgreater than 2, the solution can have a negative real wave impedance. Experiments are described for estimating changes in the Hall currents by counting flux jumps in a superconducting wire which is embedded in bulk bismuth. The Hall currents are magnified by the factor 5. In the course of the experiments, a pulse position modulator is realized. Other possible devices are realizable, notably an amplifier and a simple, rugged flip-flop."

 "A new technique that applies the inherent sensitivity and speed of response properties of photoemitters to electrophotography without the need for electronic focusing or deflection is described. An array of very fine photoemitter coated metal pins is sealed into a vacuum envelope and is used to form, on a dielectric surfaces a latent electrostatic charge pattern in response to an optical image. The resulting charge pattern is developed by standard toner application techniques. Experimental images have been formed and fixed on several types of dielectrics with arrays of 6000 1-mil-diameter photoemitters."
"A new system of electrophotography--the Canon NP process--is discussed. A photosensitive member comprising an insulating layer, a photoconductive layer, and a conductive layer is used in this process. The procedure for the formation of latent images consists of three steps: 1) primary charging, 2) image exposure with ac corona discharging, and 3) blanket exposure. The principle of image formation can be explained by a simple RC equivalent circuit representing the insulating layer, the photoconductive layer, and the air gap, etc. The influence of the thickness of the insulating layer on image quality can be represented by the response function of the NP plate. Sharpness and resolution calculated from the response function agree with the measured values. The NP plate has higher sensitivity than the conventional plate. This is explained by the fact that the electrostatic contrast required for development is obtained by a smaller amount of charge and that photoconductive layers of low resistance can be used. Since the NP process utilizes the injecting and rectifying properties of the photoreceptor, CdS or Se-Te alloys that are well known as one carrier photoreceptors can be used."
"With a photosensitive plate having a dielectric overcoating, an electrophotographic process available for repeated operation is developed. This process consists of three steps, utilizing the effect of photopolarization. An important feature is to allow the employment of higher photoconductive layers. As a result, high photosensitivity and high electrostatic contrast in electrophotography are achieved with this process. Factors determining the sensitivity are the rate of dark depolarization and light polarization and, in addition, the corona charging rate. This process may make possible applications in fields where only a slight exposure is allowed. What occurs in each step of this process is investigated analytically and experimentally."
"The light-induced discharge characteristics of xero-graphic photoreceptors are studied both theoretically and experimentally, using amorphous films of Se and PVK poly(N-vinyl carbazole). In addition to the dependence of the discharge rate on quantum efficiency, trapping, and transit-time effects, several new variables are considered theoretically, including the electric-field dependence and the sublinear light-intensity dependence of the carrier generation mechanism. This new theory provides the capability of computing the discharge characteristics of model xero-graphic photoreceptors. Parameters such as quantum efficiency, mobility, thickness, and dielectric constant can be varied in the calculation and their effect on the discharge characteristic can be studied. Applications of the results to the study of practical xero-graphic photoreceptors are also presented."
"The relevant physical processes involved in the photodischarge of an electrophotographic plate consisting of a homogeneous photoconducting layer are reviewed in light of recent investigations. Typical examples of this type of photoreceptor are amorphous Se and poly-N-vinylcarbazol complexed with trinitro-fluorenone. The essential behavior of this type of photoreceptor can now be quantitatively described in terms of the basic properties of the photoconductor. This description views the photodischarge process as consisting of the photoinjection of free carriers and their transport across the layer. The photoinjection process is determined by the photogeneration of free carriers and their recombination. The transport of the free carriers is characterized by their drift mobility and trapping. To be suitable for the electrophotographic application it is essential that the density of deep traps whose trapping times are long compared to the process time be low. In such materials it is seen that the photoinjection efficiency determines the sensitivity of the layer in the electrophotographic process."
"The optical exposure required to actuate a photoconductivity-controlled device is shown to be determined by the electric field across the photoconductor and not by the sensitivity of the photoconductor, providing the photoconductive gain is above unity. The exposure is approximately 6 × 105KEphotons/cm2for a field ofE V/cm and a dielectric constantK. Hence, devices that work at low fields are obviously to be preferred. In order to take advantage of the low field, it is necessary that the photoconductor be able to pass space-charge-limited currents at the same low field. Special trap distributions can lead to optical exposures somewhat lower than the above value."
"The potential of the phototransistor or \"hook\" structure for realizing gain in the electrophotographic process is considered. By considering the phototransistor to be an emission-limited device, it can be shown that gain in excess of unity can only be produced in the external circuit. The charge necessary to produce the image is accumulated on an external capacitor whose size limits the gain to the ratio between the external and device capacitances. The predictions of this analysis are supported by experiments using a commercial phototransistor in simple circuits that simulate electrophotographic plates."
"The potential of the charge transfer imaging process for producing gain is considered under dynamic exposure conditions. A photoconductor with an ohmic or injecting contact to ground is assumed to be in virtual contact with a dielectric layer. The dielectric collects the charge transferred from the photoconductor under the influence of simultaneous exposure and application of high voltage. From simple arguments it can be demonstrated that the duration of the high voltage pulse is critical in optimizing the gain in the charge contrast. The qualitative results of the simple arguments are supported by detailed numerical calculations which demonstrate that a maximum gain ofC_{ext}/2eC_{pc}\\simeq 0.184 C_{ext}/C_{pc}can be developed at a time approximately equal to(C_{ext}+C_{pc})/C_{pc}times the carrier transit time of the photoconductor. The results of the calculations are supported by experiments."
"A formal approach to the theory of electrophotography is introduced in which imaging systems are defined and classified according to the dominant physical interactions responsible for the imaging process. The usefulness of the approach lies in the fact that it provides a powerful means of comparative analysis as well as ideal standards against which the performance of real systems can be compared. Application of the theory to charged pigment electro-photography, defined as that branch of electrophotography which exploits the electric field-monopole interaction to drive development, naturally leads to two broad subclasses: charged pigment xerography (CPX), in which development is achieved through the interaction of uniformly charged pigment with a varying electric field; and photoactive pigment electrophotography (PAPE), in which development is achieved through the interaction of a uniform electric field with a varying charge on the pigment. A comparative study of the two systems reveals that the inherent noisiness of adhesion severely limits their sensitivity when it must be coped with directly. Under these circumstances, it is further seen that fluctuations in charge on the pigment leads (via the electrostatic image force) to a limitation of the force available for driving development in CPX only. Since the same limitation does not arise in PAPE, any system of the latter type may have a sensitivity two orders of magnitude higher than its corresponding CPX system, providing the two are equivalent in every other respect (equal resolving power and latent image forming efficiency)."
"Centrifuge measurements and electrostatic charge measurements have shown that the force of adhesion of xerographic toner particles to carrier beads can be described by an electrostatic model. In this model the triboelectric charge on the toner particle is attracted by its countercharge residing on the bead surface and during the process of electrostatic development this force of attraction between toner and carrier must be overcome by a competing process. In this paper it is suggested that the applied field lowers the Coulomb barrier that normally constrains the toner to the bead surface, so that under the combined effects of the mechanical impulse and the applied electric field, the less tightly held particles are stripped from the carrier bead surface. A calculation has been made on the potential function adjacent to the bead surface in the presence of an electric field, and an equation is derived for toner detachment. Measurements have been made on xerographic toner of the efficiency of toner release for various drop heights, with field applied, and without field. The results are somewhat difficult to interpret because of the wide distribution in toner mass and charge. Nonetheless, a comparison can be made between theory and experiment, and there is reasonable agreement."
"Some experiments by ordinary turntable methods have been made on the charging of ZnO-resin layers by negative, positive, and combined negative and positive (N-P) corona ions. Some mechanisms and theories of corona charging were clarified from the analyses of various experimental data such as theQ-Vcharacteristic curves of samples, theV-Icharacteristic curves of corona chargers and samples, and the variations of corona current and surface potential during the process of corona charging. Experiments on image reversal by the (N-P) corona-charging process were also tried, and some reversal images of fairly good quality were obtained by this method."
"Thin layers of zinc oxide, prepared by oxidizing zinc selenide were used to examine a previously proposed model for the spectral sensitization of photoconduction. When the sensitizing dyes were adsorbed in low densities, the chemical interactions between the dyes and zinc oxide seemed to repopulate the surface-trapped electrons and the population determined the sensitizing efficiency. When dyes were densely adsorbed, however, the trapping effect by dye molecules appeared to be large enough to smear the primary chemical interactions with zinc oxide. In dyes of a similar chemical structure, the sensitizing efficiency was related to the saturation value for dye adsorption. The light intensity dependence of photocurrent was observed to be varied by the adsorption density of dyes, reflecting the influence of trapping."
"A formulation for the toner deposition time constantWwas derived and the effect of each of the variables appearing in it or the toner deposition equation was studied by computer simulation. The simulations were performed using toners containing 10 and 20 particle sizes over a range of size frequency distributions. It was found that the effect of each variable was quite dependent upon the values of the other variables. The variables were: depletion-rate constantKtimeT, capacitanceC, electrode spacingG, toner particle concentrationN, particle diameterPD, charge per particleCP, and three choices of thickness of the diffuse double layer:WC--very diffuse-coupled with the charge per particle varying with the diameter of the particle,WB--normal-coupled with the charge per particle varying with the surface area of the particle, andWA-- tightly bound-coupled with the charge per particle varying with the volume of the particle. When the variables were such that the maximum in the distribution function for the deposited toner particles was at the lower end of the particle size range, increase in the depletion-rate constant shifted the maximum toward the upper end of the particle size range when theKTproduct became greater than 0.1 and decreased the rate of deposition. However, when the variables were such that the maximum in the distribution function for the deposited toner particles was at the upper end of the particle size range, increase inKmerely decreased the rate of deposition without affecting particle size distribution. In general, large values ofK, small values ofN, short time periods, large values ofC, and large values ofGtended to push the distribution of the deposited toner toward the upper end of the particle size range. Large values ofN, large values ofT(restricted toKT < 1), and small values ofC,G, andKtended to push the distribution maximum toward the lower end of the particle size range. The variablesK,N, andPDstrongly affected the magnitude ofWwhileTdid not affect the magnitude ofWunlessKT>0.1. For a given particle size range, the ratio ofWfor the smallest particle toWfor the largest particle was invariant with respect to the magnitude ofW. The range ofWfor a given particle size range was much less for the very diffuse layer (charge was a linear function of the diameter) than for the normal layer (charge was a linear function of the surface area) and even less than for the tightly bound layer (charge was a linear function of the volume). Change in particle size range affected the ratio ofWfor the smallest to largest particle in the range. Size frequency distributions with a maximum at some particle size or sizes tended to control the distribution of deposited particles at short deposition times (t<1 \\micro s), but could not control the distribution of deposited particles at long deposition times (t > 1ms). The choice of diffuse double layer and coupled charge dependency had very large effects on the magnitude ofWand the effect of some of the variables onW. The input-output tests showed that for a density range of 0 to 1.5, the response of the photoconductor in the present model was unsatisfactory and that a better simulation of latent image formation is required."
"A variety of processes has been used to develop latent xerographic images. In most cases development results from the interaction between the electric field of the latent image and charged, pigmented toner particles. An understanding of the physics of these processes requires consideration of electrostatic, triboelectric, mechanical, and aero or fluid dynamic effects. Compared with photography, xerography is a high contrast system. This is ideal for document copying, which has been the main application of xerography. This review includes discussions of published results on the physics and performance of a number of development processes. The processes selected for discussion are those that are of commercial importance or illustrate the range of phenomena that can be used for development."
"The history of deformation due to electrostatic forces, from the first experimental observation of the phenomenon to the latest materials and processes for recording optical images, is briefly outlined. The newer light sensitive systems are described in some detail This background is followed by a section on theory which covers electrical fields in nonhomogeneous media, critical electrical field for deformation, effect of photoresponse on electrostatic pressure, deformation rate, photon efficiency, spectral response, and resolution. Thereafter, an experimental method of generating the analog ofD-logEcurves for sensitometric measurements is presented and the effects of recording and medium variables on these sensitometric curves are discussed. Excellent agreement between theory and experiment is shown for the effect of initial surface potential and photoresponse on photographic speed. Experimentally measured spectral response and resolution are also included. The photographic properties of \"photovoltaic\" films are treated separately from the photoconductive ones because behavior is somewhat different and experimental work has been much more limited. Finally, current and potential applications are described in terms of the advantages and disadvantages which accompany photosensitive deformable films and recording processes."
"A review is given of the progress in electrophotographic science and technology in Western Europe during the years 1967 to early 1971. University research work is mainly directed towards two areas: 1) the electrical and physical properties of photoconductors, such as selenium, chalcogenides, oxides, and organic materials; and 2) the sensitization of these photoconductors. Industrial research teams report on the preparation of electrophotographic layers on development and on image evaluation. A bibliography including scientific papers and patents published on this subject during said period completes this review."
"A review of the latest investigations carried out in Bulgaria, East Germany, Poland, and the U.S.S.R. is presented. The discharge mechanisms both in dark and under illumination are being analyzed for two types of electrophotographic layers--with a binder and without it. In both cases, the discharge mechanism does not only depend on the layer type, its structure and technology, but also on the conditions of charging and discharging. It is shown that the photo-discharge mechanisms of selenium electrophotographic layers and of zinc oxide layers with binder differ in principle. The characteristics of As-Se electrophotographic layers and electrophotographic process with an effective quantum yield exceeding unity have been considered. Some works investigating the prospects of application of organic photoconductors in electrophotography have been reviewed. Information on the electrophotographic copiers and electrophotography for medical purposes is also provided."
"Major contributions from Japanese investigators in the field of electrophotography are reviewed. Scientific research into understanding photoelectric behavior of zinc oxide and other electrophotographic materials, efforts for developing new electrophotographic systems (e.g., electroplate marking), and analysis and improvement of electrophotographic processes are among the topics included."
"Herein is reported a newly developed high-speed facsimile receiver for use over a wide-band transmission line of up to 48 kHz. The main feature of this equipment is low cost and high speed obtained by mechanical scanning. Good quality electrostatic recording has been achieved at a speed of up to 4000 line scans per minute. The circle-to-line converting multistylus made by printed circuit technology is used for the recording head. A single torsional spring-type rotating wire brush is driven directly by a high-frequency multipole hysteresis motor; thus good contact and smooth operation are obtained with light pressure at high scanning speed."
"Japanese newspapers have been very active in the development of electronically delivered hard copies. The Asahi Shimbun (newspaper publishing company), in collaboration with the Tokyo Shibaura Electric Co., Ltd., has developed an experimental model, the \"AT-2\" Telenewspaper Receiver, and also the model \"AT-3.\" These telenewspaper receivers are primarily aimed at saving time in the printing, transport, and delivery of ordinary newspapers. From the requirement for makeup of edited newspaper proof and for the dimension of receivers, a reception copy size of about 70 percent of ordinary newspapers was adopted. In order to open the way to practical use in private homes, the receiver must satisfy several special requirements. The significant specifications of machines that could meet the requirements of the home facsimile are discussed."
"This paper describes two types of electroprinting tubes, one of which has been applied to television facsimile. The electrostatic printing tube and fiber-optics printing tube have a resolution of 8 lines/mm and 15 lines/mm, and a writing speed of 200 m/s and 1700 m/s, respectively. The electron scanning method utilizing the fiber-optics printing tube showed good results in experimental television facsimile."
"An electrostatic printing process called VIDEOGRAPH makes use of a special cathode-ray tube for the generation of latent electrostatic images. Television-like signals produce these images on the surface of dielectrically coated paper by means of a special face plate. This face plate contains a large array of finely spaced electrical conductors which permit the transfer of the electrostatic image produced by the electron beam from the vacuum side of the face plate to the dielectric paper in contact with the atmospheric side of the face plate. These images may be developed and fixed in much the same manner as other electrostatic images. Equipment based on the VIDEOGRAPH process has been principally applied to the production of magazine address labels. The developed equipment produces address labels from digital input data at rates up to 14 000 lines per minute. This results in over 1 000 000 labels per 8 hour operational periods. Other equipments include facsimile, digital line printer, and high-speed point plotters. Printers using the process tend to be quiet in operation, have relatively few reciprocating parts, and provide relatively troublefree high-speed operations. The output is limited to a single copy and, to achieve high resolution, rather expensive precision circuits are required."
"Mechanical typewriting translators have been widely used for monitoring of Kanji (Chinese character) teleprinter system in newspaper companies despite their substantial disadvantages such as slow typing speed, poor stability, difficult maintenance, and mechanical noise. These disadvantages were completely solved by our electrostatic Kanji teleprinter (Fig. 1) which features high printing speed, reliability, and stability of operation."
"This paper describes the empirically observed characteristics of electrographic printing in which electrostatic charge patterns are deposited onto a dielectric surface via a contacting electrode and subsequently made visible by toning. The process exhibits a threshold effect that may be used in simplifying the addressing circuitry. An equivalent circuit of the electrode and dielectric coated-paper combination that incorporates the threshold effect is presented. Typical printers using this electrographic process are described, and some requirements of the drive circuitry necessary for such printers are discussed."
"Several basically different nonimpact printing processes have been developed in the last several years using modulated or deflected ink jets. This review paper describes these processes, which are also applicable to the accurate dispensing of fluids, particle sorting, the generation of uniform droplets for research purposes, and other applications."
"A simple, new electrolytic printing method for alphanumeric characters is described. The paper employed may be an ordinary cellulose paper that is locally sensitized by means of a suitable wetting device that distributes the recording solution onto the paper just before recording. The wetting mechanism of the paper has been fully examined by taking into account the effects of evaporation and the paper capillarity. The action of the gravitational field on the deposited liquid film has been also examined. The semifluid friction mechanism that allows the very high sliding speed of the wetting device onto the paper has been also examined. A closer examination of all these phenomena has guided the practical realization of a suitable wetting device. This wetting device can be employed in conjunction with a printing head constituted in a preferential form by a vertical row of a given number of pairs of electrodes, each electrode of the pair being on a line in the direction of the printing head travel. In this way, good spot definition is obtained even at very high printing speed, provided that the electrolytic recording solution satisfies some conditions. The problem of the electrical interaction between switched pairs of electrodes has been fully examined, and suitable means for obtaining constant color intensity have been described. We have shown that the general problem of the formulation of the electrolytic recording solution may be handled in a remarkable way by using the electrochemical equilibrium diagrams. In a similar way one can treat the related problem of the corrosion of inert electrodes after very long runs. Finally, different kinds of printing heads have been described."

 "A small, dedicated computer has been interfaced to a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for the purpose of generating, registering, and fabricating microelectronic device and circuit patterns with submicron dimensions. A preliminary registration accuracy of ±0.1 µm over a (950-µm)2pattern field has been demonstrated."
"The main advantages of electron-beam methods for the fabrication of microcircuits are: 1) improvement in resolution; and 2) ease of automation. A computer-controlled electron-beam machine has been developed from a high-resolution scanning electron microscope and has incorporated several important features for use in microfabrication, such as an LaB6gun to improve brightness and stability, and a special electron collection system based on channel multipliers, which is particularly suitable for use with large flat specimens. The control system is based on a small general-purpose computer with a flexible data input facility which can be made compatible with the output of most computer-aided mask design facilities. The input data is based upon rectangular shapes but additional nonrectangular shapes can also be handled. Several of the important technical areas of the machine have been evaluated, e.g., resolution, speed of operation, area of coverage, etc. It has been found that speed of operation and area of coverage are both related to the beam diameter used and the effect of this rather complicated interrelationship has been studied. The machine has been used to generate patterns on mask and wafers and results indicate that it has direct application to microcircuit manufacturing and one immediate use would be to develop it into a mask maker where it could produce a complete set of standard size masks (1x) in one working day."
"In modern microelectronics, complicated structures with very small dimensions must be fabricated on active-device materials. This task has been traditionally accomplished by photolithographic techniques, but electron-beam exposure of resist materials has recently been explored [1]-[3]. Submicron electron devices have been fabricated in several laboratories, often featuring a flying-spot scanner to generate the pattern being exposed [4]-[7]. Paper tape drives have been used for repetitive patterns [8], and computer control of the electron beam has been reported also [1], [9]. The electron resist that has shown the highest resolution to date appears to be poly-(methyl methacrylate) (PMM). We have used this material in a resist form for microelectronic device fabrication, and in bulk form to determine energy dissipation profiles. The exposure is performed with a computer-controlled scanning electron microscope (CCSEM). In this paper, we describe the electron beam system briefly, discuss the processes involved in resist exposure and development, describe our exposure procedures using the CCSEM, and show results of fabricated devices and energy dissipation studies."
"Computer-aided design techniques are now used extensively for the production of masks in the microelectronic industries. In these methods the microcircuit patterns are broken down into simpler component parts, such as rectangles, whose co-ordinates are punched onto paper tape. A logic system has been developed to control an electron probe from coordinates read in on paper tape. Successive rectangles specified on the tape are scanned by the probe on the specimen, exposing an electron-sensitive material. A microcircuit pattern is thus built up from these basic rectangular elements. The use of an electron probe allows the generation of patterns with submicron dimensions within a reasonable time. The system outlined above has been used to produce microcircuit patterns using two techniques. In one, electron-sensitive resist is used to define a pattern etched in underlying material; in the other, metallic patterns are deposited directly by the decomposition of a metallic compound."
"High-resolution electron-beam microfabrication requires long process times when using a single scanning beam to expose large-area integrated circuits. Exposure times for a 2-in wafer by a scanning beam system are typically between 30 min to 3 h, depending on the area and complexity of the circuit. This paper describes an electron projection system that projects the whole electron image of the integrated circuit mask onto the wafer at once, enabling exposure times of 1 s or less to be attained. The system incorporates a photocathode patterned into an integrated circuit mask. The pattern is projected and focused onto the wafer using axial magnetic and electrostatic fields. Described herein are factors affecting photocathode life and exposure times. A technique for automatic alignment of the mask to the wafer is also described which has achieved 0.25-µ alignment accuracies."
"The dynamics of electrons between the source and drain of a microwave field-effect transistor (FET) have been studied using a Monte Carlo method. The spatial dependence as well as the time dependence of the average electron velocity is presented. It is shown that in silicon the relaxation time is short enough not to influence the figure of merit of the transistor. However, in direct gap polar semiconductors (e.g., GaAs), the electrons can have a velocity well above their saturation value for an appreciable length of time and, consequently, over a distance nonnegligible compared to the length of the active region of a high frequency FET. This could improve the figure of merit of the FET."
"The presence of the electron beam in a TWT introduces additional internal reflexions that are not present in the cold tube, at the output, at the input, and at the attenuator. These additional reflexions, that we denote \"electronic reflexions,\"increase the gain ripple. The electronic reflexions are hard to measure and therefore have to be calculated. In the present paper, equations are derived for them as functions of Pierce's TWT parameters. A conclusion is that the electronic reflexions often exceed the cold reflexions that can be obtained in practice. The electronic reflexions in TWT's with a backward fundamental coupled-cavity structure are almost an order of magnitude larger than those in helix TWT's."
"An electronically variable microwave delay line uses an extended low-velocity drift region between the input and output helices in a TWT configuration. In this paper, theoretical limits on the maximum delay obtainable from such delay lines are calculated. For a given velocity dispersion, the insertion loss is predicted to rise sharply to prohibitively high values at a critical electron-drift velocity. This sets a practical upper limit to the delay obtainable from such devices; detailed calculations of this maximum delay as a function of the beam parameters (size, current, shape, velocity distribution) are presented. Important factors in the generation of velocity dispersion in the beam and experimental results are discussed in a companion paper [7]."
"A voltage-variable delay line with octave bandwidth in L band and a delay range of 500 ns has been developed. This entailed the development of a low energy spread electron beam as the signal carrier. The physical causes of velocity dispersion are discussed, and the expected form of the velocity distribution function is derived. Detailed design considerations and experimental results on several L-band tubes are presented. In particular, the theoretical prediction of a sharp rise in attenuation at a particular delay was confirmed experimentally."
"Proton bombardment has been used to make a semi-insulated gate gallium-arsenide field-effect transistor. This technique combines the simplicity of the metal semiconductor FET technique, the advantage of operating the device using positive as well as negative bias on the gate, and the possible use of higher conductivity material for the channel, which may result in a higher transconductance and a higher saturated current density."
"The noise behavior of the GaAs Schottky-barrier gate field-effect transistor has been investigated theoretically and experimentally. It has been found that an additional noise source has to be taken into account in GaAs FET's biased in the pinchoff region: the intervalley scattering noise. This noise source has been investigated and a new transistor noise model is proposed. Measured and calculated noise figures show good agreement in the frequency range 2-10 GHz. It is shown that the influence of the intervalley scattering noise can be reduced by reducing the channel thickness, and that such devices show excellent gain and noise properties in the X band."
"Some MOS transistor models for computer-aided design, each having a given accuracy and complexity, are presented. These models apply before saturation and in the saturation region. Before saturation, the proposed theory takes into account the behavior of mobility versus gate-channel and drain-source biases. In the saturation region the effect of mobile carriers on the drain-channel space-charge layer in an approximate two-dimensional analysis is taken into account. This model has been checked for dc characteristicsI_{D} (V_{DS})and different channel lengths, dynamic resistances in the saturation region, transfer characteristics of various inverters, and dynamic response of these circuits. The accuracy is within 5 percent."
"GaAs vapor-grown n-p-n-p structures have been prepared from which two-terminal negative-resistance Shockley diodes and three-terminal semiconductor controlled rectifiers (SCR's) have been fabricated. For basewidths between 1 and 5 µm, these devices have a breakover voltage between 5 and 20 V, a forward voltage of about 1.2 V, and switching times on the order of 1 to 10 ns. Uniform near-bandgap electroluminescence with external quantum efficiencies up to about 0.2 percent is obtained at room temperature. The SCR's fabricated from the vapor-grown structures exhibit classical latching behavior upon application of a gating pulse to either of the interior layers."
"Emitter and collector series (extrinsic) resistances can be evaluated by measuring the open-circuited (floating) junction voltage as the other junction is forward biased. Evaluation can be carried out on either a point-by-point basis or with the aid of a curve tracer. Specific results are indicated for a 2N4400 transistor and an experimental transistor."
"Studies of the effects of the encapsulation on Gunn device performance have been carried out. Results are compared with those of Howes [1], and certain apparent discrepancies are explained."
  "K-band Read diodes were fabricated with a combination of epitaxial deposition and diffusion process. The diode produced 250 mW at 19.6 GHz with an efficiency of 5.3 percent and two chips mounted diode delivered 410 mW at 17.6 GHz."
"It is found that an aluminum conductor can fail due to a thermal stress caused by periodically applying rectangular power pulses to semiconducting devices that generate heat internally. The mean time to failure due to this process is calculated. The agreement between the calculated values and the experimental data is good."
"We point out that the area under the measured doping profile curve from the junction to the depth reached at breakdown affords an unambiguous test for \"bulk\" (as opposed to edge or surface) avalanche breakdown in a p-n or Schottky junction."

"Expressions are derived for the probabilityP_{n,m}that a pulse initiated bynelectrons (or holes) in a uniformly multiplying semiconductor diode will result in a total number of electrons (or holes)m, to give a gainm/n, and for the probabilityQ_{n,m}that the gain will bem/nor greater. It is shown that the distributions are far from Gaussian. The gain distributionP_{1,m}for a single photoelectron, for example, is shown to have a maximum value form = 1for any value of the average gainM=m/n. The derivations are valid for any electric field distribution and assume only that the hole ionization coefficient\\beta(E) can be approximated by the relation\\beta(E) =k\\alpha(E), where\\alpha(E)is the electron ionization coefficient andkis a constant. A method of determining an effective value ofk, for cases where\\beta=k\\alphais not a good approximation, is presented. The results can be used to calculate the average gain and the mean square deviation from the average, giving results in agreement with previously published relations [1], [2]. The implications of this theory on the use of avalanche diodes for low-level photodetection are discussed. It is shown that in the near infrared, cooled avalanche photodiodes can compare favorably with the best available photomultiplier when used either in a photon-counting mode, or for the reliable detection of low-level laser pulses."
"Experimental measurements of the gain distribution and noise spectral density of silicon avalanche photodiodes are presented and compared with McIntyre's theories [7], [8]. Excellent agreement is obtained using keff, the effective ratio of the hole and electron ionization coefficients, as the only adjustable parameter."
"A compact bipolar transistor model [integral charge-control model (ICM)] has recently been developed that intrinsically includes many high-level effects (for example, conductivity modulation, base push-out effect, Early effect, and impact ionization). This paper presents a detailed characterization of a high-frequency silicon bipolar transistor using the ICM, with sufficient accuracy to allow calculation of intermodulation distortion. A set of electrical measurements for extracting ICM model parameters is described, and the method of extraction is discussed in detail. Finally, calculated values of second- and third-order distortion produced signals are compared with measured values and are found to be in good agreement, which demonstrates the accuracy of the ICM."
"A number of specific examples of a certain class of electrostatic deflection yokes, here called pattern yokes, have been described in the literature by Gray [1] and Schlesinger [2]. In this paper a theoretical procedure is presented that permits the determination of the potential distribution as well as the deflecting properties of these yokes. The method is illustrated on Schlesinger's curved-arrow pattern yoke and a modification of that yoke. The general nature of the deflecting, distorting, and defocusing properties of such yokes is discussed."
"The purpose of this paper is to analyze and characterize in some detail a 100-GHz double-drift IMPATT oscillator. The small-signal and large-signal behavior of the diode has been analyzed using a semiconductor-analysis computer program. It is suggested that previously reported experimental results have been achieved with the aid of second-harmonic tuning and that 150-GHz single-frequency operation is possible with the present diode structure."
"In order to evaluate the quality of a microwave device and to design a suitable circuit for it, the device must be characterized in terms of an equivalent circuit. At low microwave frequencies L through X bands, devices can be characterized in a relatively simple manner in conjunction with a coaxial transmission line network analyzer. At higher frequencies, such as millimeter-wave frequencies, however, the characterization must be carried out in a waveguide. This paper presents a technique for characterizing an IMPATT diode mounted in a waveguide and the associated circuit parasitics at millimeter-wave frequencies. The passive and active device parameters and the circuit parasitics, which have increased effects particularly at millimeter-wave frequencies, are evaluated by means of a computer-aided iterative curve-fitting method from the measured variation of the input impedance (VSWR) as a function of position of a movable short placed behind the device. The accuracy of the technique and the computer program are first checked by comparing the characteristics of anX-band IMPATT diode measured by the present technique and those measured by the network analyzer method. The characterization of a millimeter-wave IMPATT diode is then presented. A technique to achieve the stabilization required for the measurement of active parameters of the diode is also described. Comparison of the performance of an IMPATT diode amplifier calculated from the measured diode characteristics with the experimentally observed amplifier performance is then presented. It is shown that the device characterization technique can effectively be used for the analysis and design of a millimeter-wave circuit in which the device is used."
"Temperature and electric field profiles are considered for TRAPATT structures in the nonoscillatory state. Two specific device structures (1 and 6 GHz) are compared and their geometrical limitations on diamond heat sinks are shown to be similar. The effects of space charge and large temperature drops across the active layer are also considered."
"This paper describes the use of phosphosilicate glass (PSG) films as an effective mask against zinc and tin diffusions in gallium arsenide. It is shown that films with a high phosphorus pentoxide content (as much as 30 percent by weight) can be used to obtain adequate crack-free masks against these dopants. Effective masking was obtained for diffusion depths (unmasked regions) up to 10 µ."
"It is shown that the lumped circuit that has been used to date to represent a Gunn diode with a steadily propagating domain cannot and does not properly account for the transient, and therefore, high-frequency behavior of a Gunn diode. We have derived the nodal equations that must be obeyed by any circuit that is to represent a Gunn diode with a steadily propagating domain under all conditions --small signal and large signal, sinusoidal steady state, and transient. The validity of the new circuit and the fact that the conventional circuit would give erroneous results under transient conditions have been checked by transient experiments on the computer simulated Gunn diode. It is also shown that the domain differential capacitance is approximately half of what is given by zero diffusion theory, a result first predicted by Kuru, Robson, and Kino, and the discrepency is accounted for by the nonzero width of the accumulation layer, and incomplete depletion in the depletion layer."
"The analytic theory of continued fractions is used to find the zeros of a complex polynomial representing a wave interaction dispersion equation. This method reveals new insight in studying these problems and may be programmed for the digital computer."
"A qualitative and quantitative theory of the MOS transistor in saturation is developed, taking into account the fact that the carrier concentration in the drain region is not negligible. With reference to the behavior in saturation, an injection level is defined. This level is directly related to two parameters: the drain saturation field EDSand the effective depth of the drain region xD. A division of the current domain in low, medium, and high levels is proposed. For low injection levels (for which the saturation field is smaller than the critical field), an iterative procedure for the calculation of the drain saturation conductance is given. A method for determining the channel configuration is presented. Inconsistencies in the pinchoff concept are revealed by the calculation of this configuration and by the analysis of the validity domain of the equations based on gradual approximation."
"This paper presents a method of computer simulation useful for analysis of an axially symmetrical magnetic circuit with exciting coils, magnetic poles, and permanent magnets. The vector magnetic potential is obtained by the use of the well-known successive over-relaxation method, so that devices having magnetic hysteresis characteristics can be analyzed easily and accurately. In this program, the magnetization intensity distribution within the magnet is taken into account. The new computer programming system is applied to a magnetic shielding hollow sphere, a bar magnet, a ring magnet, and a periodic permanent-magnet structure for traveling-wave tubes, and the flux distribution for these magnetic circuits is shown. The results are seen to be in good agreement with theoretical and experimental values."
"The free charge-transfer characteristics of charge-coupled devices (CCD's) are analyzed in terms of the charge motion due to thermal diffusion, self-induced drift, and fringing field drift. The charge-coupled structures considered have separations between the gates equal to the thickness of the channel oxide. The effect of each of the above mechanisms on charge transfer is first considered separately, and a new method is presented for the calculation of the self-induced field. Then the results of a computer simulation of the charge-transfer process that simultaneously considers all three charge-motion mechanisms is presented for three-phase CCD's with gate lengths of 4 and 10 µ. The analysis shows that while the majority of the charge is transferred by means of the self-induced drift that follows a hyperbolic time dependence, the last few percent of the charge decays exponentially under the influence of the fringing field drift or thermal diffusion, depending on the design of the structure. The analysis shows that in CCD's made on relatively high resistivity substrates, the transfer by fringing-field drift can be very fast, such that transfer efficiencies of 99.99 percent are expected at 5- to 10- MHz bit rates for 10-µ gate lengths and at up to 100 MHz for 4-µ gate lengths."
"An approximate two-dimensional numerical analysis has been developed for studying double- (or triple-) diffused transistors. The program supplies dc and hf terminal characteristics (e.g., hfe, rbb, fT, IB, VBE) over a wide range of operating collector currents and voltages for a given set of physical device parameters (mask dimensions, impurity profile, etc.). The approach is based on obtaining a set of differential equations describing current flow in the longitudinal (emitter-collector) direction and a separate differential equation describing current flow in the lateral direction. The assumption is made of space-charge or space-charge-neutral regions with current- and voltage-dependent boundaries. The equations are valid for arbitrary injection levels and automatically include such high-level effects as conductivity modulation, base widening, and emitter current crowding. Both theoretical and experimental results are given for transistors with fTvalues between 100 MHz and 3 GHz. The validity of the approach is confirmed and some areas requiring further study are outlined. The technique described is felt to be particularly attractive for the design and optimization of high-power microwave devices, due to the small computer execution time and memory requirements."
"The purpose of this paper is to show that switching delay times of a few microseconds can be obtained in VO2coplanar threshold devices. The investigation of the influence of different parameters (pulse height and pulse width, pulse rate, ambient temperature) on the delay time and the recovery time underlines the features of the thermal switching phenomenon: decrease in the delay time when voltage and temperature increase, increase in the recovery time with overvoltage, and decrease in the maximum repetition rate with overvoltage. The experimental results are similar to those published on other threshold devices."
"The properties of thin oxide MNOS structures are studied. An analytical theory for the switching time constant is derived and curves of the switching time constant versus the nitride field are computed. These curves are useful in the design of MNOS-memory transistors. The theory is compared with experiments. The normal current in the thin oxide MNOS structures is assumed to be a modified Fowler-Nordheim current. At small oxide thicknesses and low nitride field, an additional current is shown to exist that is attributed to direct tunneling into traps in the nitride. The discharge of MNOS structures is briefly discussed and is shown to be due to a direct tunneling of charge carriers from traps in the nitride into the semiconductor."
"Based on the results of a large-signal computer simulation, a trapped plasma mode of oscillation is described in an n+-n-n+ silicon structure. The mechanism is similar to TRAPATT in many ways, but relies upon space-charge injection of majority carriers rather than a depletion region for the necessary initial electric field profile. A necessary design criteria ofN_{d}L < 10^{12}cm-2is established."
"Lasing has been observed in CdS crystals in air at atmospheric pressure and at room temperature. The crystals were pumped with pulsed 20-kV electrons through a vacuum-tight, electron-permeable nickel film. Voltage threshold for lasing is reached for a 13-kV electron beam incident on the film and is about the same for the crystals in vacuum or air. Laser life at 20 kV is also the same for the two environments--about 106pulses of 50-ns duration."
"Empirical data are presented showing that the effect of aluminum in the annealing of fast states in MOS structures is dependent on the linewidth of the aluminum. The density of fast states under 0.2-mil-wide aluminum is found to be essentially the same as that in regions not covered by aluminum."

"Some of the possibilities and problems of high-density integration and packaging of light-emitting diode displays are explored, using a new electrothermal characterization of light-emitting diodes. After a brief discussion of thermal effects in spontaneous light-emitting diodes, the characterization is derived. It reveals a peak in luminance with increasing electric power due to self heating. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of the characterization for gallium arsenide phosphide monolithic displays. Finally, the characterization is used to evaluate some projected high power-density applications. These particularly involve dense diode arrays and the use of higher levels of integration, together with magnification by projection of an image onto a screen, to reduce the cost per element associated with processed chip area. Self heating is found to cause a strong dependence of the luminance on the number of elements powered in a dense array, and to limit severely the achievable magnification even with improved packaging."
"The IGFET bucket brigade in integrated circuit form is a particularly simple structure for implementing dynamic charge transfer shift registers. Experimental and analytical studies show that incomplete charge transfer is an important limitation of register performance leading to signal degradation. This sets an upper limit to the clock frequency and to the number of stages in the register. The effects leading to incomplete charge transfer include: 1) the finite rate at which charge moves from one capacitor to the next through the IGFET transconductance; 2) the reduction in transfer rate (due to IGFET output conductance) when part of the charge has already been transferred to the drain; and 3) the loss of charge to interface states. The relative importance of these effects depends on device structure, clock frequency, clock voltage amplitude, and waveform. Under most operating conditions the IGFET output conductance contribution is most important, and the best results were obtained with a structure that minimized the effect. Experimental data show that p-channel registers in 31-bit strings can be operated satisfactorily to clock frequencies in excess of 5 MHz, and that by appropriate register design significantly better performance should be possible."
"Redistribution of boron and phosphorous impurities in silicon resulting from two consecutive oxidation steps is calculated by using either the method of Green's function or by separating the redistribution after the first oxidation into a constant and error function term. An approximate but analytical solution for redistribution after the second oxidation is then obtainable. Employing a variety of oxidation parameters normally used in several MOS-transistor fabrication processes, the impurity profiles at the end of the second (gate) oxidation process is calculated for each case for both boron- and phosphorous-doped substrates. These profiles compare well with those obtained experimentally fromC-Vmeasurements made on Schottky-barrier diodes deposited on silicon wafers that underwent the same oxidation processes."
"A nonpulse MOS-C τ0measurement procedure, based upon the capacitance-voltage characteristics derived in response to a linear voltage sweep initiated and maintained under inversion biases, is described, analyzed, and illustrated. The most significant advantages of the procedure are interpretational and instrumentational simplicity. For typical dopings and oxide thicknesses, the conveniently measured lifetime range covers 0.1 µs ≲ τ0≲ 10 µs. About a decade improvement in the limits on the conveniently measured lifetime range can be achieved by employing relatively thin (0.1 µ) or relatively thick (1 µ) oxides."
"A new experimental technique, based on local temperature-induced changes in optical absorption, is used to study second breakdown in avalanching reverse-biased silicon-on-sapphire diodes. The technique allows spatial resolution down to 1 µm and temperature resolution of a few degrees Celsius. Further, used stroboscopically, the technique allows time resolution on the order of nanoseconds. The technique, in conjunction with special constant-current bias circuits and light-emission studies, has been used to elucidate the physical mechanisms underlying second breakdown in avalanching diodes. It is found that second breakdown occurs when the thermally generated leakage current becomes large enough at some localized region of the junction to quench the avalanche there. Under pulse biases, the product of the average pulse power times the square root of the delay timeτDwas essentially constant forτDas short as 1½ ns. However, the junction temperature atτDincreased asτDdecreased, and for very shortτDthe heating was highly nonuniform."
"Measurements of the amplitude and the phase of the current density in a Brillouin beam modulated at large signal levels were made at 1940 MHz and at harmonics of 1940 MHz as a function of the amplitude of the modulating signal. In addition to a surface current similar to that reported for small-signal Brillouin beams, current existed along the axis of the beam that was very large and often 180° out of phase with the surface current. Thus, at some axial positions, a cavity surrounding the beam would detect practically none of the current in the beam. At some drive levels above the point where electron overtaking occurred, it is shown that the RF current in the beam disappeared completely in both the radial and axial directions after the beam drifted approximately one plasma wavelength from the modulating cavity. Explanations based on measurements of the velocity distribution of the current are given for the unusual behavior of the current in the Brillouin beam. The distribution of the second and third harmonic currents in the beam were similar to the fundamental current distribution. One of the implications of this result is that it is probably not possible to use the second harmonic current in klystrons utilizing Brillouin beams for efficiency enhancement."
"A new procedure has been developed for fabricating small-area silicon avalanche diodes directly on a plated copper heat sink. The process incorporates multilayer vapor-phase epitaxially grown silicon and a preferential electrochemical etching technique to fabricate thin uniform silicon films; 6 µ thick films on 2-cm diameter wafers have been obtained reproducibly with little difficulty. Inverted mesa diodes 30-40 µ in diameter have been formed by etching through the unmasked area of the thinned silicon wafer. Implementation of this technology has resulted in single drift region p+-n-n+diodes that generate over ¼ W CW power with 6-percent efficiency at 60 GHz."
"The sensitivity of a parametric upconverter for the detection of 10.6-µm radiation was measured. 10.6-µm radiation was mixed with the 1.06 µm beam of an Nd :YAG laser in properly oriented single-crystal proustite. The upconverted output at 0.967 µm was then detected by an S-1 photomultiplier tube. NEP of 1.1×10-9W . s½was measured."

"A detailed analysis of MOSTV-Istatic characteristics is given, showing clearly the effect of mobility variation along the channel. In this analysis, the widely used formulas for the mobility field dependence are considered and compared. The analysis follows two approaches. In the first approach, a critical field εc, is defined beyond which the mobility is no longer constant. Since the drift field increases towards the drain, theV-Iplane is divided into three regions by two loci representing the two extreme cases of whether the drift field at the drain or its value at the source is just equal to the critical value. The derived equations are plotted for different values of a parameterkthat gives flexibility on the way the mobility is expected to vary along the channel. In the second approach, the mobility formula is that proposed by Trofimenkoff and Caughey, and is valid for any value of the drift field. It gives one current equation with the restriction that it is only valid up to a certain drain voltage below pinchoff. The results in both cases show clear tendency of current saturation before pinchoff, as well as substantial overall reduction in the current levels and mutual conductance. This trend is more pronounced in short channel MOST's."
"The MOSTV-Istatic characteristics were investigated in Part I [1], taking the mobility µ only as variable with the drift field. In this part, the analysis is extended to include the simultaneous variations of the mobility µ and the bulk charge QBalong the channel. From the mobility point of view, the analysis follows that of Part I with the two approaches of piecewise and continuous mobility variations. However, in this case the resulting equations are only solvable numerically, and the computed results are plotted. The results show that effects due to the additional variation in QBalong the channel are in the same sense and enhance those due to variation in mobility alone. Also, higher doping and greater oxide thickness show themselves in a way as though the mobility were approaching the limit of velocity saturation. The overall effects show more reduction in current levels as well as output and mutual conductances, and increased tendency of earlier saturation. As far as these effects are concerned, the results favor a MOST of small oxide thickness and long channel. However, since a long channel impairs the gain and high-frequency characteristics, the results given in this paper help to show how a compromise may be obtained."
"Radioactive ignitors using tritium as the active material are shown to be a reliable electron priming source for the RF discharge gap in plasma limiters when cascaded with a diode limiter. This result is based on ion-chamber studies of priming current strength, electron distributions, and thermodynamic and chemical stability of titanium-tritide electron sources immersed in low-pressure gases. The results ofX-band measurements of the statistical distribution of output spike leakage amplitudes for overvolted discharge gaps and the threshold of breakdown of the RF gap in tuned plasma limiters containing titanium-tritide ignitors followed by a diode limiter show operating parameters equivalent to keep-alive plasma limiters. Experiments with the tritiated passive priming source substituted for the conventional dc keep-alive discharge show a greatly increased operating life in receiver protectors and gaseous TR's and the improvement of other important electrical parameters such as noise, reliability, and external driving power."
"The linear interactions between spin waves and (drifted) helicon waves in p-type ferromagnetic semiconductors are analyzed in terms of the spatial normal modes of the uncoupled system. The coupled mode equations are investigated in the region of phase synchronism between the negative-energy-carrying helicon mode and the positive-energy-carrying spin wave mode. If these modes are weakly coupled, a convective instability is indicated when the carrier plasma frequency ωpis less than the spin precession frequency ωo."
"Various JFET and MOSFET devices have been studied at LN and LHe temperatures. Transient and steady-state heating of the devices at 4.2 K is investigated and it is found that the active part of the device typically heats to a steady-state temperature of 40-60 K. A transient and steady-state heating model of the device is constructed and the results are found to be in good agreement with the measured temperatures and heating transients. Studies of the noise at the various ambient temperatures show that different physical phenomena are responsible for the noise. Low-frequency noise in JFET's seems to be of generation-recombination type. Thermal noise is prevalent in the frequency region between 100 kHz and 1 MHz. The noise in some of the MOSFET devices increases with decreased temperature and seems to be surface state or \"flicker\" noise, The noise in MOSFET devices is by factor 5-100 times larger than the noise in investigated JFET devices."
"The low-frequency noise in silicon JFET's was measured continuously for temperatures varying from 30 to 300 K. Distinct peaks in the noise were observed for all transistors tested, suggesting the presence of distinct trapping levels in the forbidden gap. An attempt to match theory with experiment indicates that one of the peaks can be explained by the presence of gold in the silicon as expected. However, a discrete trapping level cannot explain the second peak observed in the noise, as unrealistic capture cross sections for the traps would be required. It appears that the mechanism causing this second peak also contributes to the noise level at higher frequencies, and more work must be done to determine the exact nature of the processes involved. A third peak at lower temperatures cannot be explained with present theory. Possible causes of the noise appear to be dislocations in the crystal lattice, gold acceptors, and a splitting of the gold level due to strain."
"An analytical approximation of the multiplication factorMis derived for linear and abrupt junctions for the case of equal electron and hole ionization rates. The results are compared with the exact multiplication curve for different abrupt and linear GaAs junctions and the relative errors are plotted."
"Exact numerical solutions have been obtained for a forward-biased diffused-junction n+-p-p+silicon rectifier operating from low to high injection levels. The results indicate that under high-level injection conditions, there exists a quasi-neutral region (i.e., a region wherein the electron and hole concentrations are very nearly equal) in the device which is not confined to the lightly doped p-base region but stretches into the diffused n+region as the injection level increases. For the impurity profile and the Shockley-Read-Hall recombination model used, it is additionally found that the quasi-Fermi potentials for both electrons and holes are constant across a large portion of the diffused region adjoining the quasi-neutral or \"effective base\" region. The most significant finding, however, is that at the boundary between the effective base region and the diffused region, the hole current varies more or less directly as the carrier concentration, in contrast to the situation in a step-junction rectifier where the minority carrier current in the heavily doped regions varies as the square of the carrier concentration at the base edge. A simple analysis shows that this linear relationship can be related to the constant quasi-Fermi potentials across the diffused region. As a consequence of the aforementioned linear relationship, the injection efficiency of the diffused junction is roughly independent of the injection or current levels. It may be high or low depending on whether the concentration of recombination centers in the diffused region is small or large compared to that in the base region. This is unlike the situation in a step junction where the injection efficiency would be initially high and then degrade, as the current increases."
"A procedure is suggested by which dc and ac base gain parameters can be computed for general impurity distributions in the base. The procedure consists of solving the current equation as series in the recombination time (1/τ). The series expansion coefficients are computed for a Gaussian distribution up to first order, along with the resulting base alpha transport factor and the transit time. Mobility variation with impurity concentration is also taken into account. Explicit expressions for cutoff frequencies and excess phase shift (\\omega_{T}, \\omega_{\\alpha}, \\omega_{beta}, m) are developed using the coefficients of the series expansion up to the second order. Computation of these parameters for the case of an exponential distribution, with and without assumption of diffusion coefficient variation, results in new expressions and values."
"Analytical solutions for the forward characteristic of thyristors have been limited to abrupt and constant doping profiles. Average values for the mobilities and the carrier lifetime had to be assumed for each region of the device. Results will be presented here which are based on an exact numerical solution of the transport, continuity, and Poisson equations for the one-dimensional thyristor. Doping, mobility, and lifetime can be varied from point to point. Thyristor structures are much wider and higher doped than the devices treated numerically in the literature. The dependency of the forward characteristic on various device parameters was examined, and the important results were verified experimentally. For high current and a base width that is large compared to the diffusion length, the dependency of mobility on the carrier concentration leads to a base voltage drop significantly lower than that expected from analytical theory. Furthermore, it is shown that for this case the parameters of the highly doped side regions (doping, width, and lifetime) have much less influence than predicted from Herlet's [3] theory."
"The thermal resistance performance of and total material area required for various arrangements of three or more active devices in regular patterns are compared to the equivalent quantities for single mesa devices and annular devices of varying ratios of thickness to diameter. Triangular (trimesa), square (quadrimesa), centered-square (pentamesa), andN \\times Narrays of mesas are considered. A closed-form solution for the temperature distribution both inside and outside the periphery of each mesa allows consideration of thermal interaction among mesas. Results are presented in the form of plots useful for design."
"Theoretical solutions are given for the thermal spreading resistance of ring-geometry diodes. Numerical results are presented that are more complete than previous published data obtained from analog electrolytic tank measurements. Analytic expressions are given for the two limiting forms of ring geometry (a small ID to OD ratio, and an ID to OD ratio approaching unity)."
"Prethreshold measurements on long bulk n-InP oscillators with uniform internal electric fields yield values of the threshold electric field for negative differential mobility of 6800±600 V/cm. Individual oscillators have been operated in a circuit-controlled mode and were tuned from 0.25 to 1.0 GHz."
"Recently the input impedance of a differential amplifier was derived and discussed. This correspondence derives similar results using a different approach, namely, Blackman's impedance relation, and generalizes earlier observations. The results provide an alternative activeRCrealization of a bilinearRLimpedance. Various all-pass networks are also analyzed."
"Carrier removal and mobility degradation in epitaxially grown n-type GaAs, due to exposure to fast neutrons, is reported. The variations in carrier concentrations and mobilities are utilized to predict the transconductance degradation of GaAs JFET's as a function of neutron fluence. Experimental results up to a fluence of8 \\times 10^{15}n/cm2are reported and correlated with theory."
"Response times of light emission from a GaAs0.6P0.4electroluminescent diode have been measured for stepwise applications of voltage. Turn-on times decrease either with an increase of the steady-state level of current or with superposition of a dc bias voltage.

"Ruticons are solid-state cyclic image recording devices. They have a layered structure consisting of a conductive transparent substrate, a thin photoconductive layer a thin deformable elastomer layer, and a deformable electrode such as a conductive liquid, a conductive gas, or a thin flexible metal layer. When an electric field is placed between the conductive substrate and the deformable electrode the elastomer will deform into a surface relief pattern corresponding to the light-intensity distribution of an image focused on the photoconductor. Light modulated by the deformation of the elastomer surface can in turn be converted to an intensity distribution similar to the original image by means of simple optics. Ruticons are expected to find initial applications in image intensification, holographic recording, and optical buffer storage."
"Broad-band klystron operation is investigated using a large-signal digital computer simulation of electron bunching and output gap interaction. Electron bunching is examined as a function of beam voltage and perveance for a prototype series of klystrons. The development of a low energy \"spur\" of electrons is shown to limit efficiency at high perveance, particularly at the high band edge. The output gap interaction is computed in a broad fashion so that klystron performance can be evaluated for a variety of cold output cavity impedances. Application is made to a practical commercial klystron. Measured klystron efficiency is shown to agree well with computed efficiency over most of the frequency band. The limitations of using the \"merit figure\" concept for efficiency are discussed."
"Theory and experiments are presented for the pulsed MOS capacitor when carrier generation is constant. This condition obtains when quasi-neutral bulk-region generation dominates over that in the space-charge region or when generation is due to an external excitation mechanism. It is shown how the diffusion length, surface generation velocity, and external flux can be obtained from the pulsedC-iresponse. This extends the usefulness of the pulsed MOS-C to narrow-gap semiconductors, such as germanium, as well as to optical generation measurements."
"An analytical expression relating the short-circuit current of an n-p silicon solar cell under AM0 illumination to the minority carrier diffusion length of the base region has been derived and compared with previous and new experimental data. The dependence of the short-circuit current upon other solar cell parameters has also been determined analytically. Finally, in the course of systematically reducing the base-region minority-carrier diffusion length by using penetrating electron irradiation, the 1.0-MeV electron damage coefficient for several standard and new types of solar cells has been measured."
"A nonlinear lumped network model of semiconductor devices with consideration of recombination kinetics is developed. A distributed system, based on a set of recombination kinetic equations for the multiple energy level centers, in addition to continuity, current flow relationships, and Poisson's equation, is shown to be approximated by a lumped RC network. As an example of application, the forward characteristics of a gold-doped silicon diode are calculated. The calculated results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results within the range where the recombination current through gold centers is dominant."
"By optimizing selected characteristics, the performance of modern semiconductor devices and integrated circuits could be improved if it were possible to control the impurity profile in given regions of the material. However, present methods used for fabricating planar devices by diffusion techniques invariably produce profiles which are approximately either Gaussian or complementary error functions. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining a general impurity profile in semiconductor material compatible with the two-step diffusion process. The general boundary value problem for the two-step diffusion process is solved and the impurity concentration in the solid is determined as a function of the impurity concentration of the carrier gas in the diffusion tube. An optimization routine using linear programming techniques is developed which, for a given diffusion time, determines the necessary control function producing a best-fit approximation to the desired impurity profile. The optimum control functions governing the diffusion of boron in silicon for two examples are synthesized. The numerical results clearly indicate that a best-fit approximation to a given impurity profile can be realized by controlling the impurity concentration in the carrier gas during the gaseous phase of a two-step diffusion process."
"The admittance properties of a new type of semiconductor diode, the SIS (semiconductor-insulator-semiconductor) device, have been investigated experimentally. A fabrication technique is described which enables the necessary sandwich structure of two semiconductors (preferably single crystal), separated by a dielectric layer, to be obtained. The capacitance-voltage and conductance-voltage curves for a variety of SIS diodes are presented. The influence of surface states and oxide charge on the electrical characteristics is readily seen in the comparison of observed data with theoretical results for the corresponding ideal diodes. Addition of surface state, oxide charge, and other nonideal effects to the ideal SIS theory allows a good qualitative fit to be made to the experimentally observed data."
"Several tuning characteristics of waveguide-mounted transferred-electron diode oscillators, previously observed experimentally, are discussed, Frequency tuning, jumping, and saturation along with output power variation and jumping, are related to the mounting and device parameters. Two oscillation conditions relating to multifrequency resonant circuits and oscillator power output are cited to explain theoretically these observed characteristics, leading to accurate prediction of circuit behavior. This is accomplished through study of the terminal impedance of a new and improved equivalent circuit for a diode mount."
"The operation of a small area p-n junction diode above the breakdown voltage is analyzed. A new formulation in terms of ionization probability is used to derive the rate of turn-on of current in such structures. Two differential equations are given which may be used to compute the probability that a carrier swept into or generated within the space-charge region triggers avalanche breakdown. For a 27-V n+-p diode biased 1 V above breakdown, this probability is close to 0.5 for an electron entering from the p side, or 0.1 for a hole entering from n side. Experimental measurements are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions."
"The performance of microwave-biased millimeter-wave detectors using bulk InSb in the presence of a magnetic field is described. Broad-band transitions between the impurity and conduction bands together with free-carrier absorption are responsible for the detection mechanism. The performance of the device is examined as a function of the magnetic field, millimeter-wave signal, and microwave bias levels. The results show that the performance can be improved by proper choice of the magnetic field."
"Noise temperatures in argon discharges at 1-20 torr in 0.63-cm inner radius tubes are presented. The noise temperatures measured at 147 MHz were dependent upon the noise-extracting electrode arrangements; this dependence resulted from a radial noise temperature variation within the discharges. The radial variation is expected to cause a frequency dependence in the microwave region."
  "Vapor-grown p-n junctions of InxGa1-xAs have been prepared that emit near-bandgap infrared radiation at 1.06 µm with an external quantum efficiency in excess of 1 percent at room temperature. These diodes have an electroluminescence response time of 20 ns. In addition, InxGa1-xAs injection lasers have been fabricated with threshold current densities between 2000 and 3000 A/cm2at 80 K. The importance of internal absorption losses in determining the spectral distribution and the electroluminescence efficiency at room temperature is described."

"The three-aperture electrostatic lens was investigated in great detail. The potential along the axis was obtained using the relaxation technique. The cardinal points and coefficients of spherical and chromatic aberration were numerically calculated from the axial potential distribution using the classical Scherzer and Glaser formulas. The results are given for a range of lenses and for a series of voltage ratiosV_{1}/V_{2}where V1and V2are the potentials of the inner and outer electrodes, respectively. The ratio of the aperture radiiR_{2}/R_{1}is varied from 0.25 to 1 in steps of 0.25. The separation of the electrodesS/R_{1}is varied from 0.5 to 3 in steps of 0.5, and the thickness of the central electrodeT/R_{1}is varied from 0.25 to 2 in steps of 0.25. The influence of all these parameters on the cardinal points and aberration coefficients is discussed and comparison is made with published experimental and theoretical results."
"The differential amplification magnetic sensor (DAMS) comprises a rectangular Hall device and two transistors. These three elements are not only integrated as a monolithic IC, but are also made smaller by using the Hall region as the common base of the transistors, the collectors of which are used to isolate the Hall region from the substrate. Relations between electromagnetic characteristics of the DAMS and impurity atom density and effective thickness of the Hall region are analytically described, assuming a simplified model. Numerical calculation shows that a magnetic sensitivity of higher than 10 V/kG (with a load resistance of 10 kΩ) and a noise-equivalent magnetic flux density of less than 0.1 m/Hz1/2can be obtained when the effective thickness of the Hall region and its impurity atom density are well designed. Two types of test samples were fabricated. One, made by triple diffusion, had a Hall region with impurity atom density of 8 × 1018cm-3and effective thickness of 3.2 µm; the other, made by diffusion and epitaxial growth, had values of 2 × 1016cm-3and 3.3 µm, respectively. These prototypes were found to have magnetic sensitivities of 0.5 V/kG and 12 V/kG (with load resistances of 100 kΩ), respectively, when exposed to static magnetic fields. The constancy of the magnetic sensitivity is better than ten percent for magnetic flux densities below 2 kG."
"Experimental green-light-emitting GaP diodes are shown to be capable of adequately exposing Electrofax®paper with exposures of 400 µs. The diodes used were prepared from nitrogen-doped epitaxial junction material; the Electrofax paper was sensitized with a rose-bengal dye. Linear arrays of seven diodes spaced 250 µm apart have been constructed and used to print characters on a moving strip of Electrofax paper developed by a reversal liquid toner system. Measured image resolution is better than 40 elements/cm. Data are given on the electrical characteristics of a single diode and an array, and on the dependence of image density and dimensions on diode currents. The observed performance of the diodes indicates the feasibility of making a high-quality printer using light-emitting diodes (LED's) and Electrofax paper."
"A gallium phosphide monolithic numeric display with seven segments has been developed by a mesa-etching technique. Internal absorption of red emission is small so that optical isolation is very difficult in monolithic-type displays. This obstacle has been overcome by sufficiently deep mesa-etching in hot aqua regia, using a stable SiO2film as a mask. Luminance and optical isolation of segments are found to be largely dependent on the configuration of the rear contacts and have been much improved by the effective combination of a highly reflective contact and an absorbing contact. Completed devices with a digit size of 3.1 mm high and 1.7 mm wide are operated at only 10 mA per digit with a luminance of 100 fL. The ratio of the luminance of the excited and unexcited segments is as high as 85:1 in the dark."
"Recently developed electrochemical methods permit the optical mapping of large and small bipolar transistors in an integrated circuit for electrical leakage before metallization. In one methods the emitters of the leaky transistors are decorated by a deposit of amorphous silicon produced as a result of anodic dissolution of the n+silicon in that region. Other methods depend on the colors of the anodic oxide grown on the emitter and base regions of the leaky transistors. A close relationship has been established between the oxide growth on the emitter and the base regions and the defective electrical characteristics of the transistor."
"The capacitance-voltage relationships of abrupt reverse-biased p-n junctions have long been used to investigate semiconductor doping distributions. Such investigations usually employ accurate point by pointC-Vmeasurements or else RF harmonic generation to provide the required detailed connection between a small change in junction voltage and the associated quantity of charge flowing around the external circuit. The method described here differs in that a feedback loop is used in such a way as to provide a controlled motion of the low-field boundary of the depletion layer. This motion can be one of two kinds, either that of a constant amplitude modulation of the depletion layer width or else a motion corresponding to a constant amplitude modulation of the electric field. In the former case the information obtained corresponds to the carrier densityN(x), while in the latter it is its reciprocal. In practice this approach provides a number of advantages. Among these is the ability to mount the sample at the end of coaxial cables of essentially arbitrary length. This has allowed such applications as on-line profiling during accelerator implantations and profiling devices in cryostats to obtain information on free-carrier concentrations as a function of temperature. In the present paper the basis of the method and its implementation are outlined and some representative results are given."
"The microwave properties of punchthrough injection diodes exhibiting transit-time dependent negative resistances have been investigated experimentally in both the small- and large-signal regimes. The particular devices involved were p+-n-p+, M-n-p+, and p+-ν-n-p+silicon structures. Extensive small-signal admittance measurements indicated that the negative conductance of these devices arose predominantly from the transit-time delay of carriers with nearly saturated velocities. The observed minimum negativeQfactors and the variation of device susceptance with frequency were not, however, consistent with the most simple transit-time analysis. The temperature dependence of device admittance was principally attributable to the influence of the corresponding variation of carrier velocity versus electric field. The injection properties of the Shottky-barrier emitter in the M-n-p+structure made this device more temperature sensitive than the companion p+-n-p+structure. A comparison of device capabilities as free-running oscillators indicated that further increases in output power may result with increased n-region impurity concentrations. A large-signal effect was identified, which enabled significant power generation at frequencies less than the minimum frequency for small-signal negative resistance. Detailed measurements of device admittance and bias rectification versus RF voltage were obtained from tuned amplifier experiments. The largest Pf2product was achieved from a p+-ν-n-p+structure that produced 115 mW at 6.3 GHz."
"In order to ascertain the operating capabilities and drive requirements of the charge-coupled device (CCD), it has been analyzed as a sinusoidal traveling-wave device. From this model, it has been possible to show the drive requirements and the lower bound to power dissipated in the substrate of an operating CCD. Signal loss in the sinusoidal model is due solely to surface-state effects, and varies with the amount of charge being transported through the device. Signal attenuation in digital devices is significantly reduced by using ZERO's that carry at least 10 percent as much charge as the ONE's. Some numerical extracts from the calculations will help illustrate what one can expect from charge-coupled devices. These numbers apply to a CCD with a wavelength (bit length) of 72 µ and a channel width of 20 µ, being driven with a 10-V p-p sine wave at 10 MHz. The drive power, almost purely capacitative, is 27 µW/bit in the absence of a signal and 320 µW/bit carrying a charge of 10-12C. Due to the motion of this charge through the device, at least 2 µW/ active bit must be dissipated in the CCD substrate. Under these conditions, a uniform surface-state density of 1011states/cm2.eV will cause signal attenuation of 1.5 percent per bit with an alternating series of ONE's and empty ZERO's. If the ZERO's carry 0.2 10-12C, the signal attenuation drops to 1 percent per bit. The reactive power estimates described here are expected to accurately reflect actual device requirements, apart from parasitics. Surface-state attenuation, which is relatively insensitive to frequency, will be supplemented at high frequencies by diffusion-limited transfer."
"Experiments with a current-controlled bistable switching element using a CW Gunn diode are reported. Switching rates of the order of 10 MHz have been obtained. Switching is initiated by current pulses of short duration (5-10 ns). Rise times of the order of several nanoseconds could be obtained."
"Small-signal admittance and phasor diagrams for metal-semiconductor-metal microwave oscillator diodes (BARITT diodes) were calculated by taking previously neglected carrier diffusion and field dependence of carrier velocity into account. It was shown that the microwave performance greatly degrades with an increase of dc current density and of oscillation frequency."
"A new phototransducer using n-n ZnSe-Si isotype heterojunction photodiodes is presented. The phototransducer detects incident light signals of different wavelengths by proper adjustment of bias voltages across the heterojunction, and also discriminates between simultaneous light signals of different wavelengths."

"A new technique has been developed to measure the sheet resistivity of the silicon diode array target resistive overlay in a completed camera tube. The technique measures the sheet resistivity by determining the voltage profile on the oxide area surrounding the diode array area. The oxide voltage profile is set up by charge spreading out from the oxide to the diode array area. This \"charge spreading\" technique is believed to be accurate to within ±20 percent for sheet resistivities in the range of 1010-5 × 1015Ω/□. The sheet resistivity measurements are correlated with the resolution capabilities of the silicon diode array camera tube."
"A practical technique has been developed for controlling the field profile in a thin epitaxial layer of n-GaAs biased above the transferred-electron threshold. This employs a special cathode composed of an electron-injecting n+contact complemented by an electron-blocking (reverse-biased Schottky barrier) contact, which extends a selected distance past the n+contact. The situation is characterized theoretically, and potential profile measurements confirm that the desired profile can be obtained in this manner."
"Theoretical expressions are developed for the stability criterion and admittance of a thin coplanar GaAs reflection amplifier. The traveling-wave dispersion relation includes diffusion. The cathode boundary condition includes velocity modulation, injection, and distributed inhomogeneity effects. The admittance includes displacement currents running outside the semiconducting layer. The results show that the second to fifth harmonics may be more nearly unstable than the fundamental. Experiments on a coplanar epitaxial sample yield stable linear net gain at frequencies in the range 2 GHz-8 GHZ."
"Assuming a uniform carrier velocity, a unified small-signal description can approximate the behavior of divers transit-time diodes. Application is made to diodes with optimized conductive cathodes. A comparison of the \"diffusion\" noise behavior of saturated-and unsaturated-velocity diodes is made. For similar material parameters, the latter is better. However, using holes in silicon in the first instance, and electrons in gallium arsenide in the second, the saturated-velocity silicon device is superior."
"The resistance evaluation of very narrow diffused layers is described. A two-dimensional analysis of the diffused layer conductance has been made using a numerical technique. A substantial reduction of the effective sheet resistance is shown to occur when the width of a diffusion mask window is narrowed relative to the junction depth. This indicates that the conductance of such narrow layers is influenced predominantly by the lateral diffusion effect, and that the geometrical effect of diffusion mask on the vertical impurity penetration can be almost neglected. The experimental data are in good agreement with this result. Design curves are presented to determine the resistance accurately, which are useful for the design of high-value resistors in integrated circuits."
"The impurity profile of an epitaxial layer has been determined from the capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics of a diffused p-n junction. TheC-Vcharacteristics were corrected for peripheral and diffused layer effects. Peripheral capacitance corrections account for the lateral spread of the space-charge region, whose periphery is assumed to be cylindrical. Diffused layer corrections account for the penetration of the space-charge region into the diffused layer, assumed to be Gaussian. The importance of these corrections can be estimated from graphs that cover a wide range of practical diffusion conditions and junction diameters. The sensitivity of profiles to the assumed Gaussian diffusion are examined. Finally, the corrections are applied to an experimental junction and the results are presented from a computer printout. The Appendix includes graphs for determining the space-charge width of a Gaussian-diffused silicon junction, given the diffused layer sheet resistance, junction depth, and background concentration."
"The sensor is a gas-filled tube of the Geiger-Mueller type, in which an electron emitted from a photocathode is accelerated by an applied electric field to cause ionization of the fill gas. Although the operating principle is not new, this tube differs from others in that the cathode consists of a semitransparent layer of metal on the inside of the cylindrical tube envelope, which is applied by sputtering after filling and sealing. Used as a cathode during sputtering, the anode consists of a pin along the axis of the tube, providing the cylindrical symmetry for uniform wide-angle viewing. The performance of the tube is compared with that of a tube of the same external dimensions, but with more conventional parallel wire electrodes. The counting rate for the sputtered tube was a factor of 10 higher than the conventional tube, due to the larger sensitive cathode area, and uniform over 360° in a plane perpendicular to the tube axis, due to cylindrical symmetry. The counting rate for the sputtered tube was 2000/min in response to a flame 7 ft away burning natural gas at the rate of 138 cm3/min."
"A new optical receiving system is described, which can improve the SNR when a very wide range of high-frequency signals is to be detected. It uses an avalanche photodiode both as an optical detector and as an electronic mixer. A theory is presented whereby mixer conversion losses and noise performance can be calculated. The results of a number of calculations for typical diodes are presented. Measurements of conversion losses and SNR have been made at 70 MHz. The results are in broad agreement with theory. The advantages of the system are shown to lie in that frequency down conversion in the diode permits more advantageous matching to the following stage, and that the optimum value of current gain required is much reduced. A simple numerical example is quoted that illustrates that an SNR improvement of 13 dB is obtainable in a particular case."
"The frequency characteristic of the shot-noise reduction factor (R2) of the \"O\"-type diode is investigated by three methods: the first is a Monte Carlo calculation following the approach of Tien and Moshman and changing the pseudorandom numbers; the second is a computer simulation of the reduction of the modulated electrons at the potential minimum; and the third is the experimental measurement of shot-noise reduction using photoemission electrons produced by a mode-locked ruby laser. It is found by the Monte Carlo calculation that the original results of Tien and Moshman are not characteristic of the general situation, especially with regard to the peak at the plasma frequency of the potential minimum, and with regard to the dip commonly called the Tien dip. Calculations of the shot-noise reduction factor both by the Monte Carlo method and by the computer simulation approach show a rather smooth high-pass frequency characteristic. This result is verified by the photoemission experiments where the measurement accuracy has been enhanced through the use of mode locking."
"An electrostatic shield for complementary MOS integrated circuits was developed to minimize the adverse effects of stray electric fields created by the potentials in the metal interconnections. The process is compatible with silicon gate technology. n-doped polycrystalline silicon was used for all the gates and the shield. The effectiveness of the shield was demonstrated by constructing a special field plate over certain transistors. The threshold voltages obtained on a oriented silicon substrate ranged from 1.5 to 3 V for either channel. Integrated inverters performed satisfactorily from 3 to 15 V, limited at the low end by the threshold voltages and at the high end by the drain breakdown voltage of the n-channel transistors. The stability of the new structure with an n-doped silicon gate as measured by the shift inC-Vcurve under 200°C ± 20 V temperature-bias conditions was better than conventional aluminum gate or p-doped silicon gate devices, presumably due to the doping of gate oxide with phosphorous. The advantages of the new structure are: avoidance of field inversion, elimination of guard rings, and thinner and more stable oxides."
"Switching behavior of the step recovery diode (SRD) is studied through exact large-signal analysis. Two numerical methods are presented. One is suitable for steady-state and slow-transient calculations, while the other is based on a principle given by Scharfetter and Gummel, being appropriate for fast-transient calculation. Criteria for each method are described in terms of space and time intervals. A variety of doping profiles is generated by seven parameters, to determine the influence of each parameter on switching response. The normally defined transition time for current falloff from 90 to 10 percent consists of a physical transition phase and the phase of the CR time constant, which is defined as the product of junction capacitance and series resistance. The former is minimized by a narrow region of light doping, or by an abrupt profile, whereas the latter is minimized by a wide region of light doping, thus making a compromise necessary. Under the assumption of improved device fabrication technology, operation with low external impedance will allow total transition time to decrease to about one-half or one-third of today's standard sample. As was pointed out by Moll et al., a small amount of series inductance is desirable for fast transition."
"Numerical solutions of the basic semiconductor transport equations are used to analyze the ac behavior of a forward-biased diode."
"Ion implantation has been combined with silicon-gate technology for the fabrication of MOS integrated circuits that possess the principal advantages afforded by each technique. This process is essentially a standard silicon-gate process to which a single masking step and an ion-implantation step have been added in order to provide the depletion-mode devices."
"A method for the computation of electron trajectories in arbitrary static electromagnetic fields, which eliminates a major source of error, is given.

"The forward current characteristics of nickel-low-doped n-type gallium arsenide Schottky-barrier diodes are measured over the temperature range 90.5-434 K. The ideality factor and its temperature dependence is determined and found to decrease with increasing temperature according to the relationshipn(T) = 11.4T^{-1/2}+0.444 to within ±4 percent. This is in agreement with the theoretical analysis of Strikha, who predicted a temperature dependence law between T-1andT^{-1/2}. The barrier height is determined from both the saturation current and the capacitance methods. A modification is made to the forward current expression, which results in good agreement between the values of the barrier height obtained from both methods over a wide temperature range. The barrier height is found to decrease with increasing temperature at a rate of 5.8 × 10-4V/K. Comparison with the dependence of the energy gap on temperature in GaAs suggests that the observed change in the barrier height is equal to that of Eg."
"Small-signal behavior of unipolar currents injected in semiconductors or insulators is theoretically studied. The one-dimensional problem of plane-parallel electrodes is considered. Analysis neglects diffusion but takes into account carrier mobility field dependence, ionized impurities, and trapping. Arbitrary boundary conditions are assumed. The present theory describes the small-signal response by a set of four complex quantities recalling the Llewellyn-Peterson coefficients for vacuum tubes. The present paper represents a generalization of previous results obtained by Yoshimura in the following respects: new physical phenomena (hot carrier effects and trapping) are taken into account, and new applications of the derived coefficients are suggested. This paper also contains a brief comment on physical situations and devices that can be studied by the present theory, paying particular attention to high-frequency negative-resistance devices."
"We propose a new kind of cathode-ray tube, namely, the thermal-transmission cathode-ray tube (TTCRT). In the TTCRT the electron beam focused to a small spot is called upon to heat in sequence small elements of a matrix that constitutes the faceplate of the tube. A heat-sensitive or thermal paper passed across the screen and maintained in contact with it, and outside the tube, will record characters and dot patterns generated through suitable two-dimensional deflection of the electron beam. We give a description of the main parameters regulating the performance of the TTCRT."
"The neuristor has been the subject of much experimental work, but no completely successful realization has yet emerged. In this paper a line is examined based on the motion of a normal region in a superconducting film superimposed on a conducting film. The current distribution near a moving normal/superconducting boundary is discussed and three operating modes are defined as functions of the displacement velocity. For two modes this velocity is greater than 104m/s for a 10-7m film, increasing with thickness. These velocities are unsuitable for present day technology, so further discussion is limited to the lower velocity mode. It is shown that even in this velocity range it is possible for the current in the normal region to exhibit the asymmetrical distribution necessary for device operation. It is then shown that the thermal relaxation times are sufficiently short for the temperature distribution to follow changes in the pattern of Joule heat generation, and hence show the asymmetries of the current patterns. Discussion of the resultant temperature distribution shows that the thermal conductivity of the superconductor is likely to be too large by many orders of magnitude, so satisfactory operation cannot be achieved. Suitable thermal conductivities can be deduced, but are unlikely to be achieved with available materials."
"An analysis of charge transfer based on the \"charge-control\" approach has been made for charge-coupled devices (CCD's). A general closed-form equation for the charge transfer efficiency has been obtained that includes the major mechanisms of 1) charge-gradient induced drift, 2) thermal diffusion, 3) an external fringing field, and 4) charge loss due to traps or recombination. When the charge loss and fringing field terms are neglected, the results are in close agreement with the numerical solutions by Strain and Schryer. With the fringing field term included, the closed-form solution compares well with the numerical results by Heller, Chang, and Lo. The effect of charge loss on the transfer efficiency is studied and the temperature dependence of the efficiency, including the temperature dependent surface mobility, is discussed. The effect of a \"fat\" zero on the diminution of a digital one is discussed with and without charge loss to surface states. It is believed that the charge-control approach not only simplifies the mathematics involved, but also provides practical charge-coupled device and circuit design guides."
"A direct tunneling theory is formulated and applied to high-speed thin-oxide complementary metal-nitride-oxide-silicon (MNOS) memory transistors. Charge transport in the erase/write mode of operation is interpreted in terms of the device threshold voltage shift. The threshold voltage shift in the erase/write mode is related to the amplitude and time duration of the applied gate voltage over the full range of switching times. MNOS memory devices (X_{o}=25 \\Aring, X_{N} = 335 \\Aring) exhibit a\\Delta V_{th} = \\plusmn3V for an erase/writet_{p} = 100ns, which corresponds to an initial oxide field strengthE_{ox}= 1.2 \\times 10^{7}V/cm. The direct tunneling theory is applied to the charge retention or memory mode in which charge is transported to and from the Si-SiO2interface states. The rate of charge loss to interface states is influenced by electrical stress which alters the interface state characteristics. We discuss the fabrication of complementary high-speed MNOS memory transistors and the experimental test procedures to measure charge transport and storage in these devices."
"The correct form for the current-flow equation in semiconductors in the presence of density and temperature gradients, as well as electric fields, is derived from a perturbation solution of Boltzmann's equation. The conditions under which the various widely used approximate forms of the current-flow equation are valid are clearly discussed. A new term that occurs if the relaxation time depends on position is derived, and is shown to be comparable in magnitude to the other terms in the current-flow equation."
"A short highly variable VHF delay line is described, in which variability is achieved by changing the primary volume of electric field energy storage. It is fabricated using well-established planar integrated-circuit techniques."
"Space- and time-dependent perturbations of position-dependent stationary electric field profiles within negative differential mobility (NDM) elements are found as exact solutions of a linearized current density equation. The solutions, more general than those discussed previously, explicitly show the perturbation to be an accumulation of propagating disturbances. The solutions are used to demonstrate the nucleation of a cathode-adjacent high-field Gunn domain at current densities below the threshold current density for negative differential mobility."
"A qualitative agreement is obtained between the theoretical and experimentally observed gain characteristics of a structure of LiNbO3having a film of CdSe deposited on it. However, there is a large discrepancy between the values of the gain. It is argued that the presence of a depletion layer and traps at the LiNbO3-CdSe interface can account for the discrepancy."
"An accurate large-signal lumped model of a Read IMPATT diode and external circuit is developed. The equations in state-space form are solved on an 8K-word computer, allowing complete interaction between the operator and the machine. Results obtained agree closely with measurement."
"Results of computer analysis on the static negative resistance of a GaAs bulk element with a geometrical effect are presented. It is shown that a static negative resistance appears across an overcritically doped GaAs element with a geometry of expanding cross section toward the anode as a result of the development of a stationary high-field domain at the expanding part of the element. These results are in good agreement with the reported experimental results."

 "Negative electron affinity (NEA) electron emitters are presently being used in every general area requiring electron emitting devices, photocathodes, secondary electron emission dynodes, and cathodes simply for electron sources. NEA emitters are semiconductor devices whose surfaces have been treated so that the bottom of the conduction band in the bulk of the device lies at an energy higher than the vacuum energy. Thus, any electron present in the conduction band within a minority carrier diffusion length of the surface has a reasonable chance of escaping into vacuum with no further application of energy. The performance of the devices can be accurately described by conventional semiconductor theory, and the limitations are reasonably well understood as will be described. The properties of the emitted electron beams are somewhat different from those released from conventional electron emitting surfaces. These differences affect device performance and, in some cases, may lead to devices which otherwise would not be practical. The present state of the art will be described both with respect to commercial devices which are now available and also developments which are likely to result in devices for the near future."
"In order to enable optical systems to operate with a high degree of compactness and reliability it is necessary to combine large number of optical functions in small monolithic structures. A development, somewhat reminiscent of that that took place in Integrated Electronics, is now beginning to take place in optics. The initial challenge in this emerging field, known appropriately as \"Integrated Optics\", is to demonstrate the possibility of performing basic optical functions such as light generation, coupling, modulation, and guiding in Integrated Optical configurations. The talk will review the main theoretical and experimental developments to date in Integrated Optics. Specific topics to be discussed include: Material considerations, guiding mechanisms, modulation, coupling and mode losses. The fabrication and applications of periodic thin film structures will be discussed."
"The new generation of color TV-sets and other consumer electronic equipment are heavily influenced by solid state circuitry. This is shown by the rapid growth of the market. In Germany for example the market for consumer circuits will grow by approximately 30% next year. For more than 80% of all new consumer electronic sets IC's are playing an important role. (a) Complete systems of different solid state circuits are available for PAL and SECAM, RGB and color difference drive. Those systems covering nearly all parts of a TV-set from vision IF-stage to power stages are shown and explained. (b) Solid state circuits have promoted the module approach for TV-sets. This is shown by an example of one type of the TV-range. (c) A comparison between a color TV-system with solid state circuitry and discrete components is made and the technical and economic advantages are explained. A system of solid state circuitry for Hi-Fi-radio-sets is presented. It is demonstrated that with the introduction of IC's the system philosophy for radios has changed."
"Low 1/f noise direct coupled, dielectrically isolated linear integrated preamplifier circuits can be achieved through proper device and circuit design coupled with properly controlled fabrication technology. In accordance with theoretical considerations, PNP transistors were diffused in 100 orientation p-type dielectrically isolated material. Thin film resistors and aluminum metallization were utilized to complete the circuit. Rigorous control of heavy metal impurities in slice cleanup, diffusion furnaces, and metallization sources was maintained to improve noise performance. Adequate annealilng of the stressed dielectrically isolated structure was required. The post metallization annealing ambient was significant in reducing the 1/f noise resulting fr6m suface damage caused by the electron beam metallization source as well as other Process induced surface defects. The results of the various experiments will be discussed."
"A compatible complementary pnp transistor with usable breakdown voltage has been developed which allows a significant improvement in the slew rate of monolithic integrated circuit amplifiers with low to moderate standby power. Monolithic circuits with high speed npn's and lateral pnp's can be made with high slew rates, but only at the expense of standby power. As this power becomes too large to remove from the chip, the performance is limited. Compatible, complementary pnp's allow the node capacitances to be charged with high currents with low standby power, thus allowing a significant increase in circuit performance. The triple diffused vertical pnp's reported earlier are not acceptable in amplifiers because of the low collector-emitter breakdown of approximately 7.5 volts. A similar acceptable two epi process has been reported using diffusion, however, the process described herein provides much tighter control on device parameters."
"A generalized theory to produce the bistable switching and nonvolatile memory effect using the concept of two level energy transition phenomena is discussed. Possible processes for the electrical and optical switching of memory are classified and reviewed. Among these processes, we have concentrated our attention on a polarized memory effect using a change in the junction built-in field due to the dielectric polarization (or charge redistribution in the interface states or in the deep trap states)."
"This paper describes a method of integrating an npn bipolar transistor and ann-channel MOSFET on a silicon wafer. With conventional processes, such integration requires a large number of processing steps. The self-isolation process lends itself nicely to the integration of MOSFET with npn transistors and requires only three diffusions and one thin-oxide growth step. To fabricate a BIFET structure one starts with a p-substrate. The simultaneous diffusion of high-concentration arsenic with low-concentration phosphorus is followed by deposition of a 3µm, 2 ohm-cm layer of p-epitaxy, and then by high-temperature oxidation. Out-diffusion of phosphorus during this oxidation creates an isolated n/n+pocket, over which a base diffusion is made, followed by an n+arsenic emitter diffusion. During this n+diffusion, a source-drain diffusion for MOSFET is also formed over the p-epitaxy. The next step is to open a window for the gate and to grow 500 Å of oxide with phosphosilicate glass passivation. Finally contact holes are opened and metal is deposited."
"The short circuit admittance parameters for a silicon Schottky barrier field effect transistor fabricated on a high resistivity substrate are calculated from first principles ignoring the effects of minority carriers. The results of these calculations are valid to frequencies beyond the maximum frequency of oscillation of the device, which for the structure considered was about 18 GHz. The calculated admittance parameters are shown to be in good agreement with published experimental data. In order to describe the dynamic behavior of the device the static properties must first be obtained. The simultaneous solution of Poisson's equation and the continuity equation, both in two dimensions, gives the static charge and potential distribution in the device. The effects of a field dependent mobility are included in the continuity equation which is formulated in terms of the quasi-fermi level. Using the results of static two dimensional solutions, a one dimensional device model is developed which permits the dynamic device behavior to be described by a one dimensional linear ordinary differential equation. By solving this equation under appropriate boundary conditions the device y-parameters are found as functions of frequency. Calculated results will be compared with published experimental data and the sources of the deviations which exist will be discussed."
"The physical properties of double-diffused MOS transistors (DDMOST)' first reported by Tarui et al in 1969 have so far received only limited attention in the literature. While their potential for microwave operation has been demonstrated, the physical effects of a non-constant channel impurity density have not been discussed, nor has the problem of calculating the saturation characteristics been considered in any depth. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss these aspects of DDMOST operation and to relate them to experimentally determined device characteristics."
"The causes of noise in MOS structures have been the subject of intensive investigation in past years, and the introduction of charge-coupled devices has brought renewed interest to this area. Unfortunately, the exact nature of the mechanisms involved is still not fully understood. However, the recent development of new measurement techniques has given more insight into the physical mechanisms which cause the noise. The work discussed in this paper represents a two-part investigation of the low-frequency noise in IGFET's using these new techniques. Thermally stimulated currents (TSC) have been used to determine the spatial locations, energies and capture cross-sections of interface states and deep-seated traps present in completed devices. Noise spectra have been measured under many bias conditions with temperature varying continuously from 300° K to 30° K, and graphs of the equivalent noise voltage as a function of temperature with frequency as a parameter exhibit some unusual properties. In some cases, distinct peaks are observed in the noise, and the temperatures at which the peaks occur generally increase with increasing frequency. In other devices, these peaks are not observed."
"Several reports have been published on modeling the noise behavior of MOSFETs in the very-high and ultra-high frequency range. These devices showed considerable excess noise which is reflected in too high values of noise resistance Rncompared to the theoretical thermal noise limit. This report shows that at high enough frequencies the theoretical value of noise resistance (75Ω at 2 GHz) can be observed on a new kind of MOSFET called D-MOS. Measured minimum noise figures are 3.4 dB at 1 GHz and 5.1 dB at GHz for single gate devices. Noise resistance, minimum noise figure, optimum source admittance and available gain have been calculated as a function of frequency from 0.1 - 2.0 GHz for a single gate and a dual gate D-MOS structure. The results are compared to measurements, some of them made in other labs for correlation. The measurements lead to the conclusion that the thermal noise sources are sufficient to describe the noise behavior of D-MOS at high enough frequencies while at the lower frequencies the theoretical minimum noise figures could not be fully realized due to difficulties in the measurement techniques and possibly additional noise sources."
"The existing theories describing the MOS transistor operation in weak inversion do not take into account the influence of surface potential fluctuations, caused by oxide charge fluctuations. These theories explain the difference between the theoretical and experimental slope of the logeID-VGcurves by the capture of minority carriers by surface states. The density of surface states necessary to explain this difference lies between5 \\times 10^{10}and2 \\times 10^{11}cm-2V-1."
"The theory of distributed microwave transistor action described by A. J. Wahl has been tested by measurements made upon a microwave transistor embodying a single millimeter long emitter. The interesting effects predicted by Wahl for a transistor of this shape (high gain and stability at microwave frequencies) are expected to appear only in the presence of very low loss metallization. The required low loss metallization was in this case fabricated by sputter etching gold, using nickel as a sputter etching mask. The experimental devices measured had power gains and impedances which were in close agreement with those predicted using the theory of Wahl. In particular, power gains were obtained which were four times greater than would be expected from a conventional transistor having the same junction structure and area. This increased power gain is attributable to positive feedback due to wave reflections originating from the geometrical shape of the transistor and test circuit."
"When a transistor is large enough to span a length which is significant compared to an electrical quarter wavelength within the device, its operation can be treated as two coupled transmission lines. The approach used here is to solve the problem rigorously from first principles for the small signal linear case by treating it as a classical boundary value problem of TEM waves in one rectangular dimension on coupled lines which are uniform but have no other restrictions regarding transmission line parameters, coupling, symmetry, similarity, or terminations. The solution is given in terms of voltage and current everywhere in both lines and is extended to include the parasitic inductance and capacitance usually present in connecting the device into a circuit. Numerical examples show that electrical characteristics begin to deviate noticeably from those of the equivalent lumped device even at a relatively short electrical length. Computer simulation of a large distributed transistor indicates that if properly recognized and employed, distributed effects may lead to some advantageous characteristics such as in device impedance levels and stability. Other characteristics may prove to be disadvantageous or troublesome, as in large signal or class C operation. If unrecognized or ignored, distributed effects can result in highly unsatisfactory transistor operation, The general conclusion is that as microwave transistors increase in size and frequency capability, distributed effects will need to be taken increasingly into account."
"In microwave power transistors one of the most serious short-term failure modes is due to what is known as \"Current-Hogging\" effect. The emitter ballasting is the most effective way of minimizing this problem and is being practiced widely today. However, since the exact account of this effect requires a complex three dimensional thermal analysis coupled with minority carrier injection mechanism, which in turn is dependent on the external circuit, complete analysis of this phenomenon has not been carried out thus far."
"Several new designs of microwave power transistors have been reported in the past few years. However, the merits of each of the different designs have not been studied experimentally. This paper discusses results of an investigation in which transistors having an interdigitated emitter structure are compared directly with transistors utilizing the matrix emitter structure. In order to minimize the variations introduced in the device processing the matrix transistor and the interdigitated transistor were designed on the same 20 × 30 mils2bar. Both devices have the same base area of 3 × 8 mils2and the same emitter size of 1.25 microns, which is approaching the limit of the present contact photolithography technology. The above design parameters result in a packing density (defined as the ratio of emitter periphery to base area) of 5.0 for the interdigitated geometry and 6.5 for the matrix geometry."
"In order to effect an optimum trade-off of various device parameters to achieve ultra low noise figure at or above 4 GHZ, a much more accurate model based strictly on the measurable physical parameters is required. We have introduced a distributed equivalent circuit with distributed noise sources and current generators. All of the parameters including the current gain factor have been calculated from the first principle. Unlike all of the previous device models, the effect of multiplicity of the emitter finger is carefully taken into account in the present model."
"The design, fabrication and evaluation of microwave bipolar silicon transistors are described for pulsed operation at power-levels up to 5 watts and frequencies in the 3.0--5.0 GHz range. Typical power gains of 4-6 dB at 3.5 GHz with 25% efficiency have been achieved with \"mesh\" emitter geometries. Emitter line vcidths of 2 µm and metalization stripes of 2.5 µm are employed in the mesh cell design. Steep impurity profiles are used to minimize the high injection level effects of emitter neutral capacitance and base widening. The effects of phosphorous and arsenic emitter diffusion profiles on the microwave performance are contrasted. The technology trade offs are discussed such as material orientation, emitter diffusant, contact metalization, edge breakdown and passivation. The contact metalization is silicon-doped aluminum to provide low contact resistance and prevent silicon dissolution into the aluminum on contact formation. A deep oxide base isolation is used, in contrast with the conventional guard ring diffusion, to increase breakdown voltage, lower parasitic bonding pad capacitance, and minimize oxide steps to permit high photographic resolution across large areas. The evaluation of the microwave transistors is performed with a unique \"chip carrier\" to provide low base lead inductance to the ground plane. Ribbon bonds are used in place of the conventional wire bonds to reduce lead inductance. Transistor performance is discussed in terms of input and output matching, maximum available gain, gain compression, and efficiency."
"Computer designing techniques and novel processing were used to develop an experimental, high performance microwave transistor which is useful as a low-noise amplifier in both the S-band and the C-band. The transistor, L-216C, is a double diffused, NPN silicon transistor made by a special planar process without the aid of electron beam lithography or ion implantation. The transistor has a measured fmaxof 30 GHz, and it has achieved a noise figure of 3.0 dB at 4 GHz and 4.2 dB at 6 GHz. The maximum available gain at 4 GHz and 6 GHz are 11.5 dB and 8.0 dB respectively."
"We have recently applied the principle of the hollow dielectric waveguide laser to the CO2:N2:He system. The resulting lasers are very compact and give output powers of a few watts. The narrow bore capillary (1 mm dia.) used as the waveguide, allows CW operation at gas pressures up to\\sim1/2atmosphere. The increase in pressure broadened linewidth has resulted in 3 nanosecond pulses in a forced mode locked laser. Single frequency lasers with a large tuning range should also be possible. Many applications are possible in the fields of molecular spectroscopy, air pollution studies, and as a local oscillator in an optical receiver."
"A new technique has been used to obtain pulse-amplitude modulation of CO2laser radiation in a GaAs expitaxial thin film waveguide. This technique uses spatial perturbation of the guided-wave mode. The waveguide structure used in this experiment consists of a high-resistive (\\rho \\gsim 10^{0}ohm-cm) GaAs thin film expitaxially grown on a heavily doped (N \\simeq 1.6 \\times 10^{28} cm^{-3}) substrate. A large index difference between the active thin film and the substrate allows the establishment of a number of TE and TM modes in the guide one at a time. To reduce the propagation loss only the TEomode was excited and propagated through this guide. When a negative square-top voltage pulse was applied to the guide through a Schottky barrier electrode, a light pulse was detected. The amplitude of the light pulse increases linearly with increasing applied voltage pulse and/or the length of the electrode. A study of the mode profile reveals that the electric field interacts with the propagating mode and produces a distributed perturbation in the mode profile. Preliminary results indicate that about one percent amplitude modulation (peak light pulse/maximum dc signal) at high repetition rates can be obtained by applying peak voltage pulses of ∼20 volts."
"The attenuation of an optical guided wave can be ascribed mainly to two mechanisms: surface scattering and bulk absorption. Scattering losses have been an impediment in the development of active integrated optical devices. Measurements of attenuation coefficients at 6328Å in ZnO films grown epitaxially by chemical vapor deposition on sapphire substrate will be presented. After polishing the films, losses as low as ∼ 1 db/cm have been observed for low order modes."
"Distributed feedback lasing in a thin film optical mode has been produced by a periodic perturbation of the guide height. Using photoresist and ion milling techniques, gratings with a period of\\approx0.2\\microand a peak to peak height of\\approx0.1\\microhave been formed on fused silica substrates. The guiding medium was polyurethane doped with Rhodamine 6G and the laser was pumped by a N2laser."
"Laser oscillation has been observed on the guided modes of leaky, optical film waveguides by using a light amplifying dye dissolved in the film to provide the gain and backward diffraction from a spatially periodic modulation of the film's thickness (corrugation) to provide the feedback. One of the phenomena observed is laser oscillation on hybrid guided modes where the feedback is provided by backward intermode diffraction rather than intramode diffraction. Under certain conditions, polarized oscillation on a single waveguide mode is also observed. The technique used to analyze these phenomena will be discussed and comparisons will be made between theory and experiment. Calculated thresholds for laser oscillation in corrugated AlxGa1-xAs structures will also be presented."
"Optical waveguides were formed by increasing the index of refraction of a glass substrate by exchanging constituent glass ions in a small region near the surface. The glass refractive index is related to the density of the ions and to their polarizabilities. Tl+, K+, and Ag+ions were thermally diffused into the glass and resulted in a region of higher index. Index changes as high as .15 and waveguide thickness up to several microns were measured."
"A prototype microwave S-band amplifier utilizing Electron Beam Irradiated Diodes (EBID) has been built and evaluated. The amplifier consists of an electron beam forming and modulating structure, a high voltage accelerating region, a reverse bias silicon diode target section, and an output circuit. A helix was designed for optimum velocity modulation of the electron beam at a beam potential of 1 kv. The low beam velocity allows for a long interaction time in a relatively short helix. A subsequent post acceleration region provides a bombardment potential of 10 kv for the EBID diode. Hot test results of the EBID amplifier showed that the velocity modulation of the electron beam current was better than 80%."
"This paper describes the design and testing of developmental electron-bombarded semiconductor devices for high-power nanosecond risetime pulse amplification. Pulse amplifiers have been developed utilizing both density modulation and deflection modulation of the electron beam. Density modulation of the beam is achieved with a high-transconductance planar gridded-gun structure. The modulated beam then impinges on a reverse-biased semiconductor target. Deflected beam operation is obtained by passing the beam through a traveling-wave deflection structure suitable for operation over a very broad frequency range. The beam is thus deflected on or off a reverse-biased diode. Both the density modulated and deflection modulated devices have been developed and evaluated to determine their suitability of application. The design approach to each type of device is described with particular emphasis on beam-modulation techniques and the design of radiation-resistant semiconductor targets."
"The use of negative-electron-affinity materials as secondary emitters results in marked performance improvements in photomultiplier detectors. This paper treats the developmental type C31024 photomultiplier which utilizes five GaP(Cs) dynodes to provide gains of the order of5 \\times 10^{6}. The high secondary emission ratio (greater than 20) of the GaP(Cs) dynodes permits the electron-multiplier section of the device to resolve photoelectron inputs consisting ot 1, 2, 3 or 4 electrons as discrete events. The single-electron anode pulse rise time is 800 ps. Data are presented on time- and frequency- domain measurements and a comparison of measurement techniques is presented. Applications are discussed in the fields of laser-light detection and medical electronics."
"This paper describes the development and performance of an electron beam-semiconductor hybrid photo multiplier tube for gigahertz laser communications. The photomultiplier tube consists of a photocathode, with peak sensitivity at 0.53 µm corresponding to light from a Nd-YAG frequency doubled laser source, and a fast silicon diode in parallel proximity to the photocathode. The diode is mounted on a specially designed 50 ohm coaxial feedthrough at the base of the tube. The low-noise property of the detector is preserved by transferring the processed photocathode through the vacuum system into its final position in the tube. This technique is also necessary to prevent degradation of the diode characteristics during processing. The reverse biased silicon diode acts as the electron multiplier and collector. The bandwidth and S/N considerations for this hybrid photomultiplier tube will be presented. The solutions of the problems associated with the compatibility of the tube components with each other and with the tube processing techniques will be given."
"The tetrode switch tube is a video amplifier with a number of unique features which make it particularly attractive for series modulator service with linear beam devices. The paper will discuss the development of a linear beam tetrode designed for radar modulator service. The tube has a peak video output power of 14 megawatts producing -140 kV pulses at 100 amperes with a pulse duration of 25 microseconds and a duty factor of 0.5 percent. It consists of a gridded convergent linear beam electron gun and a mirror image 100% depressable collector."
"A new type of 25 KV glow regulator suitable for color television receiver applications has been developed. The output voltage varies less than 2% over a current range of 50 µa to 2 ma. The device also provides a novel fail-safe feature and a regulated focus voltage output. Glow discharge devices have been used extensively in the past as voltage regulators. They are characterized by simplicity, low cost, long life, stable characteristics and low dynamic impedance. Single tubes typically operate at 100 or 150 volts. Regulation of potentials in the kilovolt range has been performed by employing series chains of glow regulators, by corona discharge devices or by vacuum tube or transistor regulator circuits. In many applications, these approaches have not satisfactorily met cost, size, regulation, noise or x-radiation requirements."
"IGFET switched-capacitor memory cells form the heart of a fully decoded dynamic. 1024-word by 1-bit p-channel random access memory. With 10V drive circuitry, chip access time is measured to be 150 nsec and cycle time is 300 nsec. On-chip power dissipation at a 300 nsec cycle is 100 mW (100 mW per bit) and is correspondingly lower at lower speeds. Refresh power at 100°C is less than 1 µW/bit."
"Joint integration of n-channel MOSFETs and Schottky-Barrier diodes (SBD) requires only modest changes in the overall FET process but offers considerable improvements over all-FET circuits in power consumption, density and performance. To implement SBD's n+pockets are outdiffused through a p-type epitaxial layer and put in contact with the proper metal. MOS guard rings are utilized to relieve electrical field enhancement around the perimeter of the device."
"Various workers have predicted that the CCD should be a low-noise device. This paper will discuss measurements of noise in 32, 64 and 128 bit 2-phase silicon/aluminum gate CCD's which tend to confirm these low noise predictions. The various noise sources expected in CCD's (i.e.: Shot noise of signal and background charge, incomplete transfer noise, fast interface state noise, and output amplifier channel and reset noise) will be briefly discussed along with the spectral density anticipated for uncorrelated and correlated noise sources."
"From the viewpoint of the fabricator and user, a charge coupled device should be two-phase, have no requirement for narrow metal gaps, use only a single type of insulated gate structure, require little change in standard IGFET processing, and offer the same reliability that other circuits have. The Conductively Connected Charge Coupled Device (C4D) satisfies these requests."
"In order to provide a general-purpose dynamic shift register, and to demonstrate the LSI capabilities of the bucket-brigade class of MOS circuits, a 1024-bit bucket-brigade dynamic shift register chip has been designed and built. This chip is organized as four 256-bit registers with common clocking. It operates up to 1 MHz with a 10 V p-p clock swing. Digital regeneration has been included at 16-bit intervals to offset the degradation of incomplete charge transfer at high frequencies. The design has been based on the Al2O3-SiO2insulated gate FET technology, including the use of BIGFET's to supply the output currents required to interface with TTL circuits. The chip is 0.167 inches beam-tip to beam-tip, and the effective area of each bucket-brigade bit is 10.8 square mils using 10µ design rules and oversized cell size to provide wide operating margins. On a few test slices, the operating frequency has been extended from the normal 1 MHz to at least 1.5 MHz by the inclusion of an ion implant to control dynamic drain conductance."
"Electrical characteristics of shallow (∼ 3500 Å) arsenic-implanted junctions have been determined for a wide range of process conditions and have been compared with arsenic diffused junctions obtained using a doped oxide diffusion source. Process conditions examined included various pre-and post-implantation gettering cycles, anneal temperatures (600 to 900°C), dose (1\\times10^{15}to1\\times10^{16}ions/cm2), starting material (homogeneous, epl) and post-implantation surface passivation."
"The feasibility of fabricating visible-light emitting diodes (VLED's) by ion implantation has been investigated. Zn-ions at 20-40 kev energy were implanted into Te-doped GaAs06P0.4epitaxial layers on GaAs substrates with ion doses ranging from1 \\times 10^{14}to1 \\times 10^{16}ions/cm2. Details of the diode fabrication process will be given, together with the characteristics of the finished devices, as well as resistivity, mobility, and photoluminescence data of the implanted layers as a function of the annealing and implantation parameters."
"Non p diodes anti an n-channel depletion mode IGFET have been made on InSb using a proton bombardment technique. Extending the technique one step further has made it possible to fabricate a lateral npn transistor on8-9 \\times 10^{13}cm-3germanium doped InSb. Small signal betas of2\\frac{1}{2}have been obtained at collector currents of approximately 200 microamperes and a collector emitter voltage of about 0.2 volt. The base region is optically active. By increasing the base drive, the optical response can be increased by about a factor of three over the open base case before noise becomes significant."
"This paper describes the physical properties of arsenic and boron implanted silicon which have enabled bipolar transistors with hFEfrom 20 to > 1000 and with fTfrom 1.5 GHz to 7.7 GHz to be made. The process, which is capable of producing extremely uniform distributions of electrical parameters (e.g., hFE112 ± 1.2) is clearly extendable to a broad distribution of possible doping profiles and hence device characteristics."
"The advantages of the collector-diffusion-isolated (CDI) bipolar device structure compared to the standard-buried (SBC) structure are improved packing density and process simplicity. Disadvantages of CDI, which have limited its range of application, are low BVCBO, high CCB, and an unavailability of Schottky diodes. Additionally, the electrical properties and yield are first order functions of the control of the (1) intrinsic base doping (hFE, VBE), and (2) extrinsic base doping (resistors)."
"Because of its higher accuracy and reproducibility of impurity doping, ion implantation is favorable for constructing both the emitter and base junctions of transistors, especially narrow base structures like UHF or microwave transistors. It is also important in this case to minimize the emitter dip effect which appears in the double diffused transistors and often causes emitter-collector reach-through. To meet these requirements, a new process using double ion implantation has been developed for UHF power transistors designed for cable television, mobile radio transmitters, etc."
"A family of miniature 10 watt traveling wave tubes has recently been developed by Varian. These tubes have one fifth the volume of conventional traveling wave tubes and are small enough to fit inside X-band waveguide. The key to achieving the small size of these miniature tubes is the use of samarium cobalt focusing magnets. The high magnetic field which can be obtained from samarium cobalt allows the miniature tube to be designed at much higher current and lower voltage than conventional tubes, and in this way the length of the tube is reduced to about one half that of a conventional tube. The magnet diameter is reduced because of the high field strength of the magnets."
"The printed circuit TWT offers the promise of an order of magnitude reduction in tube manufacturing cost, as compared to conventional TWTs with comparable performance. The low cost of the printed circuit TWT is acheived by using a radically new approach. All the tube elements, including the electron beam forming electrodes, the microwave interaction structure, the collector, and all electrical and microwave connections are printed on a pair of ceramic sheets. The sheets themselves form the vacuum envelope of the tube."
"An experimental traveling-wave tube designed at X-Band frequencies is introduced. The developmental effort has been directed toward the realization of a highly efficient device, which is both lightweight and rugged and is commensurate with space-type applications. Moderate basic interaction efficiency is substantially increased to high overall conversion efficiency by suitable implementation of a single-stage depressed collector."
"Since the advent of Samarium-Cobalt magnets, traveling-wave tubes have entered a new phase in their development, which will secure first place for them in the power-frequency race for many years to come. The high fields which can be achieved (at reasonable cost) with rare-earth magnets permit the TWT designer to focus much higher currents through smaller helices than was possible in the past, Such dense beams can, however, impose extreme thermal loads on the fragile helix structure, when they are defocused by rf saturation and/or collector depression."
"The paper describes the solutions to the problems of obtaining satisfactory levels of power in the now available high-frequency (900 MHz) mobile, communication band. A major step was to redesign the coaxially structured beam power tube 8072, the low-frequency standard in the communication field, to use high-frequency, low-inductance, coaxial base in place of the pin connections. This change permitted a substantial increase in frequency and maintained the linearity of the tube transfer characteristics while assuring economic manufacturing capability."
"Two related traveling-wave tubes, both of which demonstrate in excess of 50 percent efficiency over the design bandwidth, are introduced. Low dielectric and conductive shield loading are combined with suitable velocity resynchronization techniques to provide effective beam-circuit wave interaction. Use is made of multi-stage depressed collectors to sort the electrons according to energy, thus recovering a portion of the spent electron beam energy. Both devices utilize suitable helix phase velocity tapering to provide high basic interaction efficiencies. An extension of the extremely favorable beam-circuit wave interaction occurring just prior to saturation leads directly to improved efficiency performance. The tubes operate at moderate values of velocity parameter and possess smooth and continuous transfer characteristics across extended bandwidths. The tubes are lightweight and rugged and are consistent with space applications. Focusing is achieved using periodic permanent magnets of samarium cobalt."
"A new electrostatic printing gas discharge tube called \"plasma printer\" tube is presented, which is flat in shape, simple in structure and has inherent scanning capability. The gas-filled envelope of the tube contains several rectilinear anodes, rows of cathodes opposite to them, originally devised coupling electrodes placed side by side with the cathodes, and a row of recording stylus electrodes connected with the coupling electrodes. With the aid of ionization coupling, the glow discharge in the tube is transferred sequentially along the rows of the cathodes by three-phase pulse inputs, causing voltage pulses to be fed to the coupling electrodes. Together with video signal voltages, the voltage pulses fed to the recording styli produce latent electrostatic images of dot patterns on electrostatic recording paper. After developing and fixing the latent images by ordinary techniques, recorded copies are obtained. This principle of operation makes the device almost free from mechanical wear and enables it to operate at comparatively low voltages without complicated circuits and troublesome adjustments."
"Incandescent alphanumeric displays using a 16-bar format are obtainable today. They employ 1 mil incandescent tungsten helices strung between support posts. This paper describes a new incandescent display device, fabricated by microelectronic thin film techniques. Such techniques allow high resolution dot-matrix displays to be produced, with all the cost advantages obtained from the employment of modern L.S.I. thin-film processing."
"Thermally induced optical storage and erasure (local and nonlocal) of scattering centers in thin films of smectic liquid crystals has been demonstrated. These new thermo-optic and electrothermo-optic effects provide the basis for what is believed to be the first practical application of smectic liquid crystals, an infrared laser addressed light valve for the recording, storage, and display of high resolution graphic images. Information is recorded in these light valves by an X-Y deflected, intensity modulated, infrared laser beam which locally heats visually transparent, infrared absorbing electrodes. The resultant temporary heating of the smectic liquid crystal creates light scattering centers which remain stored until erased. With a field applied between the electrodes, typically 35 volts at 1.5 kHz, the writing beam is transformed into an erasing beam thereby providing local erase."
"Applications of the electro-optic effect in nematic liquid crystals to information display devices are attractive because they are low power, passive, flat panel display devices having IC compatibility. Much of the interest in liquid crystal imaging is now particularly focused on X-Y addressed matrix displays. Accordingly, to develop simple low-cost matrix displays, 5 × 7 dot alphanumeric matrix display panels with 7 × 80 elements have been made and tested. A newly synthesized nematic liquid crystal, p-methoxy-p'- ethylazoxybenzene, was used in the panels as the major component. Cross-talk was found to be effectively suppressed by polishing the surfaces of the electrode glasses as well as by applying a blanking technique. A contrast ratio of 15 : 1 and response times from 200 ms to 1 sec was obtained between -20°C and 60°C at less than 17 V with a pulse duration of 10 ms."
"Two types of applications need cross-bar structures, alphanumeric displays and panels. When the total number or the density of electroluminescent points is high it is necessary to use monolithic crystals, containing for example, 5 × 7 or 8 × 8 integrated points. Although others have proposed devices, using localized liquid-phase epitaxy of GaAs or of red GaP, this paper presents a new planar structure, similar to Si bipolar integrated circuits. It is based on either GaAsP or GaAlAs, which are direct band gap materials, non-transparent to their own radiation, and thus allow localization of the photon emitting areas."
"Demonstrations of diffraction limited performance from a CW diffusion-type HF chemical laser are reported. A novel type of edge coupled non-confocal unstable resonator consisting of a convex mirror and a diffraction grating is used. The quality of the single wavelength beam produced is found to be superior to that of a conventional edge coupled multi-frequency unstable resonator in the sense that well defined side lobes corresponding to a coherent source are observed. It is hypothesized that the difference between the single line and multiple line results is due in part to the non-uniform gain distribution of the multi-line active medium of the CW chemical laser. A new technique of coupling power out of an unstable resonator different from the edge coupling previously suggested by Siegman is also applied. This consists of coupling power out directly through the diffraction grating zero order radiation. By this technique a large fraction of the total power is concentrated within the diffraction limited main lobe--a result difficult to achieve with the conventional annular coupling method. Peak power levels of the order of 100W have been achieved on the (P2(5)) line for flow conditions yielding approximately 1 kw in closed cavity measurements."
"A pulsed HF laser has been actively mode-locked at 40 MHz with a germanium acousto-optic Bragg cell (1) which provides the large modulation depth required to loss modulate the high gain SF6-H2-He gas discharge. The Bragg cell, aligned at Brewster's angle, exhibited low cavity insertion loss, while providing a large interaction volume for the laser radiation and the acoustic standing waves. The laser itself operates at 5 pps with a 1 meter longitudinally excited discharge with SF6-H2-He partial pressures of 1.5, 0.1, and 15 torr, respectively. Mode-locked laser emission on the 2-1 and 1-0 P-branch transitions near 2.7 microns occurred in a pulse train typically 50 µs long with a total energy of 58 microjoules. The 350 MHz inhomogeneously broadened line should yield an approximately 3 ns wide pulse; observed pulses had a Ge:Au detector limited width (FWHM) of 5 ns with a peak power of 10 watts. Details of the acoustic modulator, operating characteristics of the individual P-branch transitions and attempts at producing shorter pulses with a high-pressure, transversely excited discharge will be presented."
"The extremely complex species mixing phenomena that occur in flowing, continuous wave, chemical lasers have been investigated using a computer model. The model calculates the dynamics of the various species coupled with finite rate chemical reactions. Studies have been made of several laser designs in which fluorine is admitted into the laser cavity through an array of supersonic nozzles where it mixes and reacts with hydrogen entering from separate orifices. The chemical reactions produce HF in excited vibrational states and release significant amounts of heat. Of particular interest are the effects on mixing of lateral pressure gradients that result from the heat release and the presence of embedded shocks in the flow. The numerical procedure uses finite difference approximations to the full time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations in two space dimensions together with species transport equations and chemical kinetics. Comparisons between the calculational results and chemiluminescence photographs of the flow field show excellent agreement for the spatial distribution of HF in the cavity. The results help to explain experimental observations and suggest new directions for achieving optimum laser efficiency."
"Two classes of electrically initiated HF lasers (electron beam lasers and pin discharge lasers) are studied using separate models for discharge characteristics, chemical kinetics, and radiation dynamics. The amount of dissociated fluorine atoms produced initially is calculated by means of a model in which initiation energy is partitioned between ionization and dissociation (via excitation of low lying repulsive electronic states in various fluorides). Predicted dissociated F atom density is then inserted into an analytical chemical laser model and predicted laser outputs are compared with published experimental results. In this model, excited state densities are computed by means of a matrix procedure which is rigorous to the extent that radiation transients are those induced only by cavity and chemical kinetics--not those related to peculiarly quantum optical phenomena (such as rotation of polarization). Careful comparison of the output of an E-beam initiated amplifier with results from a comprehensive quantum optics computer code shows that the amplifier output faithfully reproduces the computed small signal gain profile, including the initial spike. After the turn-on spike the amplifier output peaks at a time given by pt_{max} = 8.2 \\times 10^{-9}sec atm. Correlation of this result with theory shows that collisional deactivation of HF by H atoms must be considered and is at least as fast as deactivation by F atoms."
"Experiments are described on a pulsed chemical laser operating on the reaction between hydrogen and fluorine at pressures above the second explosion limit. Using a stable resonator, pulse energies of more than 1 joule have been obtained, corresponding to an energy density of 10 joules/ liter, and a chemical efficiency of 1%. Short pulse flash lamps were used for triggering the reaction; the laser pulse extends considerably beyond the flash lamp duration, indicating the chain is proceeding. Detailed analysis of the spectral distribution of the output pulses indicates the possibility of a non-Boltzmann distribution among rotational states during the laser action. The laser energies obtained are compared with values calculated using a theoretical model of the reaction. The effect of rotational relaxation on the laser energy is discussed."
"Electron beams have been used previously to initiate hydrogen fluoride chemical laser action by dissociating fluorine containing compounds, and the results compared with flashlamp initiation. However, the comparison was qualitative in nature. In order to assess how useful electron beams are for initiating reactions by liberating fluorine atoms, it is necessary to know the yield of fluorine atoms per each ionizing collision of a primary electron. The object of the present investigation was to measure the yield for the case of 100 keV electrons injected into fluorine. The electron beam was a Simulation Physics Corporation machine producing a current density of 200 amp/cm2, for a time of 300 nanosecs, at an energy of 100 keV. The electrons were injected into mixtures of fluorine, hydrogen, and helium and also mixtures of fluorine, hydrogen chloride, and helium at a total pressure of one atmosphere. The resulting fluorine atom concentration was monitored using two techniques: ultraviolet absorption by fluorine molecules for the mixture containing hydrogen and absorption of a probe HF laser for the mixture containing hydrogen chloride. The data will be presented."
"New State-of-the-Art results are reported in average power and efficiency in high peak power GaAs transferred-electron devices operated at X-band in the LSA mode. Average power of .70W at 13% efficiency with 200W peak power was obtained at high duty cycle, and 16.5% efficiency with 500-600W peak power was obtained at very low duty cycle. These results double the average power, and raise the efficiency by one third, over previously reported results of pulsed X-band LSA devices. The properties of the devices are 10°/W thermal resistance,2.2 \\times 10^{15}/cm3electron concentration and 100 µm thickness in active layer and 1.2Ω low field resistance. Operating voltage is near 260V for low duty cycle operation, and near 170V for high duty cycle operation, both near 9 GHz oscillation frequency. The devices had a ratio of peak bias current to current at high bias voltage (unloaded, but oscillating in a resonator) of 2:1, corresponding: to 18.5% maximum available theoretical efficiency at low duty cycle. The second harmonic is resonated automatically in the circuit used, to obtain the high efficiency with no adjustment except bias voltage. The equivalent circuit parameter values at the fundamental frequency and the second harmonic, and the physical reason for the importance of each, will be given. The general applicability of these results, depending on device parameters, to pulsed and C.W. transit time GaAs transferred-electron devices will also be presented."
"In the past several years there has been a renewed interest in millimeter wave sources due to the advent of microwave solid state devices. IMPATT, both single and double drift, and Gunn effect, LSA as well as fundamental mode devices, have demonstrated capabilities for power generation at millimeter wavelengths. Until recently, however, the so-called \"fundamental mode' Gunn effect oscillator has not been able to compete with the power levels exhibited by these other devices."
"Experimental characterization of both planar and mesa type GaAs Schottky barrier Impatts has been performed. Small signal measurements have been made with an automatic network analyzer and processed with the aid of a computer to accurately determine diode package and chip parameters. Diffusion effects on the drifting carriers in the depletion region have been identified as a mechanism for reducing the negative conductance of GaAs Impatt diodes. Experimental results and theoretical computations will be presented to indicate the effect of carrier diffusion in GaAs as contrasted with silicon Impart diodes."
"A recently developed procedure, incorporating both preferential electrolytic etching for wafer thinning and electroplating for formation of a heat sink has been applied to the fabrication of Ka-band (26.5-40 GHz) GaAs IMPATTS. The technique is an extension of the work recently reported on 50-60 GHz silicon diodes. Both epitaxially-grown GaAs-pn juction and Schottky barrier (Pt and Cr) diodes have been fabricated. Uniform GaAs structures as thin as 4µm have been produced on plated Cu and Au supports."
"IMPATT diodes exhibit a number of unique nonlinear effects when strongly driven as an amplifier or self-excited oscillator. The avalanche zone behaves as a highly nonlinear inductor, causing parametric effects such as frequency conversion with gain and spurious oscillations in some network configurations. At high drive levels, noise output is enhanced and the spectral distribution is affected by intermodulation. These effects have been studied theoretically using the Read diode model. Using a perturbation technique, equations are derived for the multiple-frequency responses to an applied small signal in the presence of a large signal excitation at another frequency. The equations have also been analyzed for stability against spurious \"parametric\" oscillations. Theoretical expressions have also been obtained for noise generation at high signal levels and for the noise spectral distribution as affected by intermodulation. Computed curves have been derived for a number of these effects."
"The low-frequency open circuit noise spectral density, S(f) = <V2>/Δf, of an avalanching junction can be represented by S(f) = a2VB2/Iowhere VB, Io, and a2are the reverse voltage, current, and a factor dependent on the ionization coefficients, respectively. For single-drift p+-n or n+-p silicon diodesa^{2} \\simeq 3.3 \\times 10^{-20}A/Hz. However, for symmetric p-n junctions, e.g., a double-drift IMPATT diode, the first-order theory predictsa^{2} \\simeq 4.4 \\times 10^{-20}A/Hz. Low-frequency noise measurements were made on a double-drift IMPATT to confirm the inverse current dependence and to experimentally determine the magnitude of a2."
"The feasibility of fabricating a high quality S-band Baritt diode of bulk grown silicon has been established. Experimental Pt-n-Pt diodes were constructed with 5 mW output operating at 70 volts with a load efficiency of more than 2%. A special feature of these diodes is their operation at very low current densities (≈ 2A/cm2). These diodes have the low noise properties characteristic of the BARITT diode and appear to be especially suitable for low drain local oscillator applications and as sources in low power Doppler radars, such as Intrusion Alarms. The fabricating techniques are readily adapted to produce p+nn+and n+p n+diodes as well as MSM types."
"In an MNOS memory device, after a certain number of positive and negative erase/write pulses, the achievable threshold voltage window representing the difference between \"1\" and \"0\" states decreases with increased number of erase/write cycles. This decrease has been reported as a serious concern for the device and high-field stress has been suspected as the cause. The purpose of this paper is to report the extensive investigations made into this phenomenon, the findings, and a model for this failure mechanism. Instantaneous observation of the MNOS switching phenomenon has revealed that there is a large amount of \"transient charge\" involved in the switching process. Transient charge is the charge that tunnels back through the thin oxide after the termination of the excitation pulse before the flat-band voltage can be measured by conventional C-V methods. This transient charge has been neglected by all previous theories and analyses. During the rapid reversal of the erase and write pulse polarity, an exceedingly high field is exerted on the thin oxide due to the combined effect of the applied pulse and the transient charge. The high field causes what appears to be fast states and these states cause the stored charge to decay so rapidly that the observable threshold window becomes small. These fast states can be annealed out and the device can be recovered. Various experimental evidences are presented."
"This paper presents the results of an experimental technique. Its salient features are (1) direct display of the waveform representing the charging of the traps in the insulator during the application of a voltage pulse, (2) simultaneous display of both the decay of the injected charge ΔQ and the instantaneous flat-band voltage immediately after the pulse, (3) determination of the centroid x of ΔQ, and (4) self-consistent determinations of the separate geometric capacitances of the nitride and the thin-tunneling-oxide as they exist in the device. This direct technique has revealed valuable insight into the MNOS charge-transport mechanisms that could not be provided by the C-V plot approach currently used. Direct recordings of the initial decays of ΔQ in thin-tunneling-oxide (∼25Å) devices show that a large fraction of ΔQ is already lost before any meaningful C-V plots can be taken. Only for pulse amplitudes and durations below certain values will\\bar{x}coincide with the oxide-nitride interface. Even for some excitations commonly used in MNOS applications,\\bar{x}can be as much as 100 Å or more into the nitride from the dielectric interface. A device model is developed to include the transient movement of charge in the nitride. The predictions of the model are found to be in remarkably good agreement with the experimental results."
"This paper describes a new mode of operation for a non-volatile read write random access memory, where a p-channel MNOS transistor is biased in a way different from the well-accepted direct tunneling mode of operation. The drain and source electrodes of the transistor are connected t9 the negative pulse voltage supply, while the gate and substrate are grounded. Hot electron injections into the insulator takes place from the avalanche plasma when the applied voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage of the drain and source junctions as in the case of FAMOS. Besides the simple avalanche injection, hot electron tunneling also takes place near the drain and source junctions and at the same time the electric field normal to the surface of the gate region under the avalanche breakdown condition causes the direct tunneling."
"The metal-nitride-oxide-semiconductor (MNOS) device, being a potential semiconductor memory element, has been the subject of many reports. The work presented here examines the memory effects from a different angle; that is, from the thermal characteristics of the MNOS capacitors, as compared to the conventional isothermal characterization of the device."
"A new charge injection mechanism in insulators--trap-assisted injection-is considered for the MNOS structure. The dependence-on field, temperature and oxide thickness of this injection current is examined both theoretically and experimentally. The observed injection is described as electron (or hole, for the opposite polarity) injection from the silicon conduction (valence) band into the nitride conduction (valence) band via a trap as an intermediate state. The transition mechanism is tunneling, or thermal-assisted tunneling."
"When arsenic (As) diffused into gallium (Ga) or boron (B) doped Si, a retardation of the p-type base layer is generally observed; this is in contrast to the \"emitter-push\" effect associated with phosphorus diffusions. In order to simulate transistor profiles, it is necessary to be able to quantitatively describe the emitter-base interactions during diffusion. In this study, the way in which the internal electric field, the equilibrium vacancy density, ion pairing and the rate of (VsiAS2) complex formation affect the redistribution of the base layer during sequential processing was investigated. Numerical solutions to the coupled diffusion equations indicate that the electric field and ion pairing effects only cause localized retardation of a B profile during the As emitter diffusion. However, the formation of (VsiAs2) complexes causes a vacancy undersaturation in the Si to a distance in the crystal well beyond most practical collector-base junction depths. Since the local base diffusivity depends upon the vacancy density, this extrinsic vacancy undersaturation effect causes the expected retarded base diffusion. Experimental verification of the theory presented is given. It is also shown that the retardation, δ, has the following functional dependences on the parameters listed below: 1. Emitter diffusion temperature,T_{E}--\\deltadecreases with increasing TE(Above 1200°C, no measurable retardation exists for practical transistor junction depths). 2. Emitter diffusion time,t_{E}---\\deltaincreases with increasing tE. 3. Arsenic surface concentration, C2(O,t)---δ increases with increasing C2(O,t) (No measurable retardation for C2(O,t)\\lsim 4 \\times 10^{19}cm-3for practical diffusion times). 4. Initial base depth, XCBO---δ increases with decreasing XCBO(No measurable retardation for depths greater than one vacancy diffusion length). 5. Initial base surface doping,C_{1}(O,O)--\\deltaincreases with increasing C1(O,O) (No measurable retardation for C1(O,O)\\lsim 10^{17}cm-3)."
"In previous work dealing with arsenic emitters in bipolar transistors, no mention has been made regarding the (limiting) current gain mechanism in these devices. This paper presents data showing that the mechanism limiting gain in arsenic emitter structures is base region recombination, whereas for phosphorous emitter devices, emitter injection efficiency limits the gain. Moreover, the emitter efficiency increases as the concentration of arsenic in phosphorous-arsenic, mixed emitters increases. This variation of emitter efficiency in arsenic, phosphorous, and mixed arsenic-phosphorous emitters permits the fabrication of devices which have specialized emitter properties."
"Toward improving the yield of high speed device technology, it is essential to overcome E-B shorting and electrode metalization problems intrinsic to the washed emitter method. We have succeeded in forming a very shallow (∼ 1500 Å) and very narrow (< 3µ) emitter with excellent reproducibility by utilizing an As (or P) doped poly-silicon (DOPOS) as emitter diffusion source."
"A technique is presented for the measurement of the diffusion profile in the active base region of a microwave transistor. This profile is a very important parameter since it determines to a large degree the power gain, noise factor, and transition frequency. Previous profiling techniques have severe limitations for measurements in the active base. Thin layers of silicon are removed by the growth of an anodic oxide; MOS C(V) measurements are made after each oxidation. After each measurement, the oxide is removed, a new oxide grown, and another MOS C(V) measurement made The process is repeated a number of times. For each MOS C(V) curve the maximum width of the space charge layer, Wm, is determined. An experimental plot is made of Wmvs. Xx, the total thickness of silicon removed. The base impurity profile is found by calculating, for a series of theoretical profiles, the curve Wm(Xs,). The profile whose Wm(Xs) curve matches the experimental curve is taken as the correct profile."
"This paper describes a method of fabricating high voltage Power Integrated Circuits using a dielectric isolation technique. The method consists of bonding silicon wafers with a silicon dioxide layer in between and forming the various circuit element by diffusion. This technique is used to fabricate a Power Integrated Circuit consisting of three transistors and six resistors with the following electrical characteristics: Collector- Base Voltage, VCBO= 450-500V @ 1 µa. Collector- Emitter Voltage, VCEO= 350-400V @ 1 µa. Collector- Base Capacitance, COB= 3pf @ 20V. Frequency - Response, fT= 60 mZE @ 10 ma., 20V. Current Gain, hFE= 50 @ 30 ma., 10V. Emitter Resistor, RE= 260 ohms. Collector Resistor, RL=11K ohms. Isolation Voltage > 1000V. High reliability is achieved by the use of field electrodes and silicon nitride junction overcoat. One of the field electrodes is kept at the collector potential and this electrode prevents surface ion build-up and interrupts induced channels, which can occur beneath the interconnecting metallization. The other electrode overlaps the Collector - Base junctions, and it has the effect of increasing the voltage capability by reducing the radius effect. The silicon nitride overcoat prevents the migration of ionic contaminants into the passivating film."
"A new four-mask epitaxial V-groove (EVG) process for the fabrication of bipolar integrated circuits has been developed. The process utilizes non-critical epitaxial ν/N+/N-layers and anisotropic etching of silicon to eliminate the buried layer and isolation diffusions as well as the need for masking the base diffusion of the standard planar epitaxial bipolar integrated circuit process. NPN transistor, resistor, and Schottky diode characteristics are equivalent to or exceed those of the standard process. Parasitic collector-substrate capacitance is reduced to a minimum by the use of a near-intrinsic (ν) epitaxial layer between the buried layer and substrate. Side-wall capacitance is eliminated completely. Shallower high-voltage structures can be made. Collector series resistance can be reduced significantly by direct contact to the buried layer. The area of an NPN EVG transistor is less than 50% the area of a comparable NPN epitaxial planar device. A five-mask epitaxial V-groove process produces lateral PNP transistors which are superior to those of the four-mask process."
"Distributed ferrites in an injected beam crossed-field amplifier are placed near the delay line to introduce unidirectional loss, thereby allowing low loss in the amplifying direction to achieve high efficiency, while at the same time adding reverse loss to attenuate backward power flow. The ferrites inhibit oscillations, permitting systems designers to meet more stringent electromagnetic compatibility requirements."
"Several years ago, beryllium was selected as the secondary emission cathode material in a medium power S-band crossed-field amplifier (CFA). The CFA operated with 125KW peak output and 12 db gain. Tungsten dispenser cathodes had exhibited short life; beryllium was selected because its oxide surface was believed stable and capable of good secondary yield at low primary energy levels. It too exhibited short life, presumably because of either contamination or depletion of its oxide surface. The incorporation of an oxygen dispenser to provide a low background (10-6to 10-7Torr) of oxygen and a small Vac-Ion®pump to stabilize internal pressure has produced a reliable berylliun cathode system."
"In some circumstances, there are cost and system advantages when a phased array radar makes use of an RF source driving each individual antenna element. Sources with a power output of a few kW, 10% duty capability, approximately 20% bandwidth and high efficiency are of interest. To be attractive, such an RF source should cost less than a few hundred dollars. Experimental data were obtained on a demountable CFA system in which circuits, soles and electron guns could be modified as needed. BeO supported brazed circuits and printed meanderlines were used. The sole materials ranged from low secondary emitters, such as molybdenum, to high secondary emitters, such as thin films of oxides of Be alloys. The beam current could be varied from full injected beam operation at 1 ampere to partial injected beam operation at 0.01 ampere. In the latter case, secondary emission from the sole built up the beam current to several amperes."
"Recent advances in CFA technology have led to new versions of tubes which still operate in the same manner as the magnetron and early CFAs, but are capable of a greater range of performance and mode of operation. These advances are exemplified in the QKS1606 BW CFA which combines all of the recently developed features. The slow-wave circuit of the QKS1606 is a parallel transmission line consisting of 2 straps periodically loaded with 65 vanes. This tube does not employ a drift region. The insertion loss of the slow-wave structure is 1.6 dB."
"This paper describes gridded crossed-field amplifier (CFA) tubes in S and C-bands. These tubes are sole voltage tuneable and achieve octave coverage with three sole voltages. The average power capability of these tubes is 1 kilowatt and peak power operation demonstrated capability is between 1 kilowatt cw and 10 kilowatts at 10% duty. i) the slow-wave circuit ii) the cooling of the slow-wave circuit iii) the triode gun for the injected beam The cooling method allows the use of a number of standard coolants. The slow-wave circuit is a meander line on ceramics with a ground plane providing inter-finger shielding to achieve the required low dispersion. The triode allows the beam current to be continuously varied from full on to full off, and hence, allows efficient amplitude modulation of the output power of the CFA."
"Magnetron oscillators with pulse to pulse frequency agility are used in radar service to provide ECCM capability and to provide target signal enhancement by reduction of glint and clutter return signals. A family of frequency agile coaxial magnetrons called \"dither-tuned\" tubes has been developed for this service. They are tuned by a motor driven eccentric or cam connected to the oscillator cavity tuner. Initial 200 kilowatt peak power, X band tubes of this class operated with a near sinusoidal frequency tuning mode over typical tuning ranges of 40 to 80 MHz at 75 Hz tuning rates. A readout voltage signal related to the oscillator frequency for slaving the receiver local oscillator to the transmitter was derived from a resolver directly coupled to the shaft of the eccentric. The resolver is a transformer with a rotating secondary winding. 100 KHz AC voltage applied to the primary produces an output AC voltage proportional to the angular position of the eccentric and hence the tuner position and frequency."
"The intra-spectrum PM noise characteristic of a number of pulsed CFAs has been examined. Measurements were made to obtain an understanding of the noise mechanism in crossed-field interaction devices so that they can be properly specified for transmitter applications and as the first step in a program for possible improvement of the signal-to-noise ratios. Measurements were made over a range of conditions to determine noise relationships between RF frequency, pulse conditions, operating power level, receiver filter bandwidths, and types of modulators."
"An electrically addressed, liquid crystal, fourier plane filter capable of real time optical image processing is described. The filter consists of two parts, a wedge filter having forty 9° segments and a ring filter having twenty concentric rings in a one inch diameter active area. Transmission of the filter in the off (transparent) state exceeds fifty percent. By using polarizing optics, contrast as high as 104:1 can be achieved at voltages compatible with FET switching technology. A phenomenological model for the dynamic scattering will be presented for this special case."
"An electro-optic light valve was recently described, which uses the Pockels effect in a KD2PO4crystal cooled close to its Curie temperature and is addressed by photoconduction in an amorphous selenium layer. Preliminary performance was: resolution 20 lp/mm, contrast ratio 40/1, writing time 10 µs, sensitivity 100 erg/cm2for 10/1 contrast. The linearity of the Pockels effect allows image addition and subtraction, the latter being obtained by reversing the applied voltage between two exposures. Experiments of first and second order image derivation using incoherent light are described, the latter using subtraction of a blurred image from the initial one."
"In a transmission storage CRT, the maximum usable stored writing speed is limited by the tube differential cutoff (DCO). The DCO is a measure of the system nonuniformities which limit the minimum usable change in target potential resulting from writing. Experiments using an image transfer CRT are described. High speed information is first written on a storage target optimized for high speed operation. The resulting image, then spatially modulates a flood beam which writes a bistable target. Stored writing speeds in excess of 200 cm/ µs have been observed and can be attributed in part to an abnormally low DCO, often less than 0.1 volt. The low DCO is correlated with thick dielectric on the high speed target, low electric fields bounding this target, and with the erase pulses used to prepare the tube for writing."
"The purpose of this work was to fabricate and demonstrate a real time incoherent to coherent optical converter. This device has applications in real-time coherent optical image processing systems. Briefly, it utilizes the natural photoconductivity effect to spacially modulate the electrical polarization in the single crystalline electro-optic material, Bi12SiO20. An optically absorbed write-in image is stored as an image-wise polarization pattern in the device. Readout is accomplished electro-optically by means of the subsequent phase retardation which a polarized beam of coherent light undergoes in passing through the Bi12SiO20."
"Measurement is the key to research in any domain, and perhaps more in physics than anywhere else. But today, many physical events are very fast--in the pico to nanosecond range--and any really physical event is a single one. For that reason, the trend towards wideband real time oscilloscopes is clearly visible. Yet the bandwidth-sensitivity product is still limited, either in CRT's or in amplifiers."
"Vanadium dioxide is shown to be, useful as a display medium in electron tubes with applicability as large area displays, storage tubes and \"page composers\". The utility of VO2in this role is a consequence of the large decrease in the index of refraction at 67°C. Even though the absorption coefficient is large, design criteria are established which can produce two color displays of a variety of colors with reflectances as high as 70% and contrast ratios as high as 30:1. Measurements have shown better than 200 line pairs per mm resolution with a sensitivity of better than 4 mJ/cm2. Design details and performance data will be presented for a CRT capable of recording a standard television frame in a single scan. The image is stored without degradation of resolution or contrast until it is erased. Full erasure can be accomplished in a few seconds, with this design."
"A filamentary electron gun utilizing a novel planar tetrode configuration was developed as a uniform large area, high energy electron source. The tetrode configuration consists of an anode, a grid situated between the cathode and anode, a filamentary cathode comprised of parallel equispaced filament wires and a spreader electrode located in a plane parallel to the filaments on the opposite side of the grid. The anode is in the form of a thin metallic foil window that transmits the high energy electron beam from the gun vacuum to the laser gas. By adjusting the electrode potentials and spacings, the divergent electron flow from individual filaments can be controlled to form a uniform anode beam current density distribution. For certain designs, beam uniformity can be achieved with the grid and spreader operated as noncurrent intercepting electrodes. This mode of operation is thermally efficient, both as a result of the low thermal conduction losses for directly heated filaments and because none of the kinetic beam power is dissipated by the low voltage gun electrodes."
"Stabilization of large volume discharges in CO2laser mixtures utilizing thermionic guns as electron sources have been previously reported. These past studies have been confined to the regime of quasi-cw pumping due to the low ( <30 ma/cm2) beam currents available from thermionic cathodes. We report the successful application of a high current density (>300 ma/ cm2) cold cathode electron beam source to stabilize a 5 liter volume CO2laser discharge."
"Proper cold cathode materials and gas mixtures are the key elements to long life sealed off CO2lasers. A typical requirement for spare applications is a 1 Watt sealed off CO2laser operating for 10,000 hours with a quiet, clean and reproducible cold cathode from a total gas volume of only 50 cm3."
"A high power pulsed xenon-ion laser has been developed as an optical transmitter for underwater audio communication systems. Performance and design characteristics are: peak power,4 \\times 10^{3}watts; pulse length,0.3 \\times 10^{-6}seconds; pulse repetition rate, 2 kHz; laser length, less than 36 inches; input power, less than 10 KW. To achieve the high peak power in this short length, a large bore (20 mm) discharge tube was employed. The use of the large bore, however, introduced problems which include: peak currents are in excess of2 \\times 10^{3}amperes; optimum anode voltage are of the order of 10 KV, thus introducing hold-off problems. Optimum fill pressures are of the order of 5 microns, thus introducing triggering and lifetime problems. Without pressure control, the operating lifetime of the laser was less than one minute due to gas clean-up. With cryogenic pressure control this lifetime was extended indefinitely. Simple cold cathode and anode configurations were used, however, external switching was required to prevent free-running of the laser. The thyratron switching technique employed eliminated the necessity of a separate trigger and also led to a factor of two improvements in laser efficiency by preventing ringing of the laser current waveform. Details of the laser construction and performance, the electronic circuitry and component difficulties will be presented."
"The construction and field test results of a 50 Watt sealed-off and a 100 Watt flowing airborne CO2laser of high frequency stability are described. A short-term stability of 1010and a long-term stability of 108has been achieved. The lasers feature: • Cavity construction of ultra-low expansion quartz (ULE-quartz) with a thermal expansion coefficient of 2 × 10-8(°C-1). • Internal mirror system with angular alignment and piezoelectric frequency adjustment. • Folded plasma tube construction for rigidity and compactness. • Diffraction limited TEM∞mode oscillation and linear polarization due to folding. The appearance of the specific rotation-vibration transitions as a function of cavity length has been experimentally determined for the two airborne devices and a series of similar devices ranging in cavity length from 35 cm to 275 cm. The results indicate that the number of lines is inversely proportional to the cavity length and the width of oscillation of a specific transition is constant and independent of the cavity length."
"Independent, free running 6328Å He-Ne lasers have shown a relatively good short term frequency stability, ie., a beat frequency spectral width of the order of 100 Hz measured over a period of 0.1 seconds. However, the same lasers, made from ultra low expansion materials show a disappointing drift rate of several MHz per day over periods of months despite careful temperature and pressure control. This drift, always in the direction of increasing frequency is due to changes in the optical and mechanical path lengths, since the contributions of He-Ne pressure changes and H2and O2impurities can only explain a total frequency shift of the order of 20 MHz over the life span of the laser."
"An optimization procedure is developed which completely specifies the one-dimensional design of a double-diffused transistor with only two pieces of input data required: the collector-emitter sustaining voltage and the current gain required when the device is operating in the region of quasi saturation. A simple but experimentally validated model for predicting hBEVS. Icis also developed and used in the optimization procedure. The analysis is intended to apply mainly to the case of high-voltage, high-current switching transistors which have a lightly doped collector."
"Using an analytical approach involving various approximations, Bowler and Lindholm have suggested that high current operation of epitaxial transistors may be characterized in terms of a critical voltage Vcritand a critical current Icrit. The present paper reports on a detailed computer study of high current operation: (a) assuming one-dimensional flow both above and below Vcrit, and (b) including two-dimensional effects such as emitter crowding. Measured results are also presented."
"The theory for bipolar transistors operated at high collector currents is weak. Controversy exists as to when (or if) lateral current spreading dominates over the Kirk effect. This paper attempts to answer this question. The output characteristics of silicon bipolar transistors in the common emitter configuration are analyzed in detail. The analysis proceeds by extracting the values of transistor generation current (due to small amounts of collector multiplication) from experiment, fitting these values to a model which accounts for the modulation of the collector depletion layer by mobile space charge and the lateral spreading of collector current. It is found that a continuous and gradual increase in collector effective area occurs as the collector current increases. In this manner the deleterious effects of high current density are moderated. By accounting for this effect, cut-off frequency calculations are brought into good agreement with experiment. As an independent check on the validity of the analysis, electron ionization rates are obtained, which are in good agreement with values in the literature. Effects associated with emitter crowding are also shown to be unimportant in the structures investigated."
"The current gain of transistors with wide, lightly doped collectors is is known to fall off during high current, low voltage operation. This \"two-level saturation\" effect, sometimes known as \"quasi-saturation\", has been attributed by some authors to a current density-induced widening of the base into the collector, and by others to lateral current injection at high current densities. In this paper we describe the results of experiments designed to determine whether or not lateral current injection is significant during quasi-saturation. In our experiments, the band-to-band radiative recombination observed between the base and emitter metallization in the course of transistor operation was used to determine the current distribution. This infrared radiation was observed using a very sensitive S-1 image tube fibre-optically coupled to a SIT TV camera. On the basis of the current distributions observed in a variety of transistors, we concluded that lateral injection is not the dominant factor in establishing a quasi-saturation regime."
"A complete set of new one-dimensional analytical models is derived, which describes the collector behaviour for all possible combinations of current and voltage. The influence, not only of ohmic and hot carriers, but also of tepid carriers is fully taken into account. These models, whose validity ranges all link up exactly are very accurate in spite of their simplicity, as is shown by rigorous one-dimensional numerical computations. This set of models leads to a division of the (Ic, Vcb) plane into injection, depletion and scattering-limited drift velocity (SLDV) areas. The product of collector doping and epilayer width (Nc.W) turns out to be of decisive importance for the details of such a division. This product also influences the hFE-- and fT-fall-off and the cross-modulation behaviour."
"For today's transistors made by sophisticated technology the first order transistor theory leads to results which do not compare well with experimental results. In an effort to overcome this situation Gummel for the first time used a digital computer to give a unified exact treatment of one dimensional device performance. This paper treats the two dimensional case, which is to be considered if lateral current effects are to be explained. A set of three nonlinear partial differential equations describing the flow of carriers within the transistor under steady state conditions is formulated and solved in an iterative scheme. Realistic geometries, doping profiles, recombination parameters and terminal voltages are used in the device description. The idealized subdivision into emitter, base and collector regions separated by space charge layers is avoided. The potential distribution and the electron and hole distribution within the transistor are calculated. Two dimensional plots of these quantities are shown. A number of questions, such as lateral base voltage drops and inhomogenous collector current density, which arise from spreading effects and call for a solution in at least two spatial dimensions are treated."
"Ion implantation has been successfully utilized to simplify the fabrication of a 1024 bit IGFET random access memory array ina novel manner. IGFET integrated circuits Often require enhanced surface doping to suppress unwanted spurious channels between devices. Using conventional diffusion technology, an extra masking level is required to form these regions. A technique has been developed which eliminates this extra mask by uniformly increasing the doping in the surface layer of the silicon and then controllably compensating the enchanced doping in the windows patterned to form gate oxide regions. Threshold voltage control is excellent, mobilities are normal and no undesirable effects have been observed if care is exercised in controlling the implanted doses."
"In this paper, the effects of ion-implantation upon p-channel MOST structures in Si are discussed. A brief review of the literature on the subject of threshold shifting will be given. The paper will then describe how ion-implantation of boron beneath the gate of a p-channel MOST can change the mode of operation of the device from a surface channel device to a bulk device. (Commonly known as a deep depletion device.) Measurements will be presented of the change in \"apparent\" channel conductivity of the p-channel sturcture versus implanted boron concentration. It will be shown that under certain conditions \"apparent\" channel conductivities may be increased 60% over that of a comparative unimplanted device. Detailed analysis of the transfer characteristics of a number of implanted p-channel devices will be given and compared to unimplanted devices."
"The use of ion implantation for close threshold control of N-MOS and P-MOS transistors has been studied from an experimental and theoretical viewpoint. Experimental determinations of ion implanted diffusion profiles, sheet resistivities and threshold voltages for boron, phosphorus, and arsenic implantations are reported for doses in the range from1 \\times 10^{11}to1 \\times 10^{14}ions/cm2."
"The aim of this paper is to report the realization of a silicon field effect transistor for power applications, using a process in which high energy ion implantation technique is coupled with the planar technology. This device, called \"Gridistor\", a multi-channel field effect transistor having a p-type buried layer as gate, presents certain advantages for power generation and amplification at several gigahertz. Our purpose is to realize devices with the following characteristics: 1 watt at 3 gigahertz in a class A amplifier with 6 db power gain."
"Silicon gate technology itself gives higher speed and lower power drain than aluminum gate technologies due to its low threshold voltage and self-aligned structure. Further improvements can be accomplished by using inverters of E/D structure (enhancement driver-depletion load) instead of E/E structure (enhancement driver-enhancement load). Ion implantation technology has made it possible to build both enhancement and depletion type MOS FET's on a single chip by adding only one mask to the conventional MOS IC process."
"Experience with beveled p-n junctions does not fully agree with the predictions of Davies and Gentry. Specifically no optimum negative angle as claimed by Huth and Davies was found. A new method for determining the form of the space charge region near the surface shall be presented which avoids the insufficiencies of the model cited. Apart from more accurate results, this paper gives insight into an entirely new phenomenon. In contrast to conventional theory p-n junctions with small negative bevel angles exhibit an absolute electric field maximum underneath the surface. This effect causes a reduction of the breakdown voltage even when the electric field on the surface is sufficiently small. Results will be presented which show the dependency of the absolute field maximum on bevel angle, doping profile and material resistivity. It will be shown that a limit for the use of negative bevel angles exists at about 4 kV breakdown voltage. These theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with potential probing experiments. Results will also be presented on the influence of dielectrics or charges on the surface."
"Experiments on second breakdown in silicon-on-sapphire p+-n-n+diodes show that second breakdown involves filament nucleation, filament growth, and a melt transition. Experimental results will be reviewed relating the spatial and temporal development of current filaments to voltage waveforms during constant current pulse testing. Theoretical models will be presented which show: (1) The condition for a filament to nucleate within the junction is for the thermally generated saturation current to be equal to the total current at a particular site. When this happens, the junction voltage at this site decreases sharply toward zero. (2) The multiplicity of filaments is due to competitive current paths; junction channels with their series spreading resistances versus the normally avalanching junction regions. Spreading resistance is also the reason for for the quenching of avalanche adjacent to a junction channel and the negligible voltage drop seen externally when nucleation occurs. (3) The melt formation is accompanied by an abrupt voltage drop (the melt does not follow the voltage transition). The voltage waveforms and final melt radii, for constant current pulses of different amplitudes, computed are in good agreement with experiment. (4) The threshold current for second breakdown is proportional to\\rho^{-3/4}, where ρ is the resistivity of the n-region."
"Many workers have studied the effects of emitter ballast resistors, RE, on the uniformity of current distribution and the protection against hot spots and second breakdown. These studies have been either entirely experimental, establishing empirical limits on RE, or semi-analytical, assuming isothermal junction behavior. Neither of these approaches is adequate for some power transistors where large currents and bias voltages exist simultaneously, giving rise to high levels of dissipation. In particular, microwave power transistors fall into this category where in addition to the non-isothermal behavior of the emitter-base junction, the gain and efficiency degradation by REdictates a better study of emitter ballasting."
"Infrared microscopy as a means for observing dynamic thermal processes inside a slice out from a silicon power device has been reported by Burtsev et. al. and refined by Jaecklin and Marek. Since the local emissivity depends on doping, instantaneous free carrier concentration and the optics used, interpretation of these radiation measurements is extremely difficult. In the existing literature it has been based on homogeneous emissivity throughout the sample."
"This paper describes the computer aided design, construction and rating of an improved high current, high frequency thyristor. The object was to produce a thyristor which had the advantage of a distributed gate but which avoided the expensive manufacturing steps required by interdigitated structures. A newly developed computer rating system was used as the principle design tool. A description of the resulting device geometry is given. An analysis of the computer models including those for instantaneous active aera, charge modulation, and thermal impedance as a function of area is also given. A direct comparison between computer predictions and actual performance for this device is presented as an evaluation of the design procedure's accuracy. A brief description of the methods used for determining actual performance results is also included since they offer improvements over previously employed techniques."
"Solid state electronic equipment used in communication systems is particularly vulnerable to damage from voltage and current surges when connected to outside lines. At the present time there is a dearth of compatible devices useable to protect this equipment by grounding such surges. Ideal surge protectors should incorporate the following features: • A high impedance and a high conductance state. • Fast response to surges at well defined voltage limits. • Rapid and complete recovery in the presence of normal line operating voltages. • High peak current handling capability. • Useful life of many surges. • Safe failure mode. • Low cost. With the increasing trend towards connection of customer terminal equipment to public communication system there is also need for interface devices to protect both the system and the customer. PNPN diodes are potentially capable of meeting the above requirements but must incorporate special design features in order to optimize them to surge protection applications."
"A junction field effect transistor having non-saturation characteristics like a vacuum tride has been successfully developed. Its output impedance can be decreased to 8 ohms so that it will serve in audio applications or as an impedance transformer. The geometrical structure of this FET is analogous to that of a triode tube and is based on the idea of controlling the resistance between drain and source by a potential applied to a grid-like gate structure. Design considerations that avoid saturation of the drain current will be discussed."
"Electrostatically focused klystrons have been improved by the incorporation of a shadow-grid controlled electron gun. The shadow-grid gun permits high modulation rates and complex modulation waveforms to be applied to the klystron with low voltage, low power modulation circuits. Although shadow-grid guns have been employed in magnetically focused linear beam tubes for several years, this is the first reported application in an electrostatically focused klystron. The effect of an electrostatic focusing lens system on an electron beam generated by a shadow-grid electron gun was not known and required study by digital computer techniques. Many questions concerning electron beam stability at all values of grid voltage had to be answered prior to incorporating a shadow-grid gun into an ESFK. Computer studies of a 0.7 microperveance electron beam indicated stable focusing for all values of control grid voltage."
"This paper describes the VKX-7752A klystron, a newly developed pulsed amplifier that utilizes PPM focusing. The tube produces over 125 kW of peak power with an average power of 500 W. The klystron operates at a frequency of 10 GHz with a 2% 1 dB bandwidth, and in addition provides a gain of 50 dB. The klystron was designed to provide high gain and wide electronic bandwidth. A major consideration was to provide a small, lightweight device, well suited for military airborne radar applications. By using PPM focusing, the weight of the device was held to only eight pounds."
"The rigorous, 3-D, nonlaminar electron trajectory program which was reported at the 1971 IEEE-ED Conference was applied to a large number of high efficiency klystron designs and the results compared with both, experimental results and presently existing one-dimensional and otherwise less rigorous programs available at industrial klystron laboratories. The conclusions from the evaluation can be summarized as follows: the most important difference between the results of the rigorous program and other programs is that the former predicts efficiencies to be 10 to 15 percentage points smaller than the latter, in excellent agreement with measured klystron efficiencies at efficiency levels above 50%. Another important difference is the accurate prediction of the fact that η has a maximum at finite values of the output gap angle θ and not at θ → 0. Interception is predicted accurately and, for a given set of design parameters, the efficiencies agree, within ± 1%, with measured values. In addition, 3-D velocities at the output are available."
"Accelerator applications of the high-power klystron usually require a fairly narrow bandwidth of a few percent. However, the VSWR which the accelerator presents to the klystron may vary considerably due to beam loading or changes in temperature or frequency; thus, a method of predicting the behavior of a klystron into a variable-VSWR load is quite valuable for these applications. In this paper, models of the output circuit and electron beam are presented and applied to calculate the Rieke diagram for a high-power klystron."
"A toroidal cavity developed for a 4-KW 12 GHz satellite-borne television transmitter klystron is described. The cavity has an internal Q 40 percent higher than that of a conventional cylindrical doubly-reentrant cavity, thus yielding higher circuit efficiency and conserving energy which cannot be recovered in multi-stage depressed potential beam collectors. As a result of optimization studies with a digital computer program for obtaining cavity field distributions by a relaxation method and for computing the intrinsic cavity parameters R/Q and Q δ/λ (where R is the cavity interaction gap shunt impedance, Q the cavity bandwidth parameter f/Δf, and δ/λ the skin-depth to wavelength ratio), a particular cavity configuration with conical reentrant tunnel tips and toroidal walls is shown to provide good thermal characteristics and mechanical rigidity as well as low internal losses. Methods of die-coining toroidal cavities for centimeter and millimeter wavelength klystrons are described and a comparison between theoretically predicted and experimentally measured properties of toroidal cavities is given."
"The presence of ions trapped by the space-charge depression of electron beams causes instabilities which exhibit themselves as noise phenomena in microwave tubes. It is difficult to experimentally determine the trapped-ion density. A new technique has been successfully developed by the authors which uses a second thin probing electron beam. The residual gas present under normal conditions is replaced by Ar at a pressure of 5.10-7torr because the various ionization threshold potentials of Ar are suitable for this experiment. The original beam energy is set such that it produces then only Ar+. The probing beam energy can generate Ar++from Ar+, but not Ar++from Ar. Finally, the Ar++ions are extracted by a lens and the resulting Ar++current is measured, which can be used to find the density of Ar+in the beam. It has been found in this way that extremely high ion densities exist on the primary-beam axis. The equivalent positive potential depression of these ions is about 100 times higher than the negative potential depression of the primary electron beam, and charge neutrality is only possible by trapping slow secondary electrons created near the axis by the ionizing process. The high ion density is localised on the beam axis and does not interfere directly with the microwave interaction, except by some periodic ion discharging mechanism when strong low frequency instabilities occur which interfere seriously with such applications as radar and television."
"The study of various experimental system using collector depression. led to the development of an analytical method for obtaining the collection efficiency and the power dissipation density of Faraday cages of arbitrary shape. This method is based on the solution of a Fredholm integral equation for the emission density on the walls of the multiply reflected secondary electrons. This technique has been used to analyse certain specific experimental systems, and good agreement with the experimental results has been found. In addition, new collector designs have been developed with the aim of improving collection efficiecies and obtaining more uniform power dissipation densities. The use of a small transverse magnetic field can cause a considerable improvement as will be demonstrated by specific examples. In particular, this is a valuable method for multiple-potential collector depression systems. A small reversing transverse magnetic field at the entrance to the Faraday cage has also been studied and it has been found that this is a good method for preventing backstreaming electrons from introducing an increase in noise."
"Evidence was found of multipactor discharges occurring in the output cavity and waveguide of a large klystron (1.3 Mw peak, 150 kW average 805 MHz). High energy electron bombardment in many areas of the cavity and waveguide was found and investigated by recording the X rays generated, by providing windows for visual observation, and by manipulating the magnetic fields. Slides will be shown of some of the X-ray films, and of color photographs of fluorescent surfaces and incandescent particles in the cavity. In general, the cavity was brightly lit by the various discharges, while the beam tunnel was relatively dark, both visually and by X-ray recording."
"Blooming has been a problem in many applications of Silicon Target Camera Tubes. The blooming is a result of the lateral transfer of charge in the bulk of the silicon substrate. This \"blooming\" condition has placed a serious limitation on some applications of silicon target camera tubes including: (1) Low light level surveillance at night in the presence of man-made light sources such as car headlights and street lamps when these light sources \"bloom\" in the picture. (2) Indoor surveillance when bright lights are in the field of view and information next to the lights is obscured. (3) Studio and outdoor use in Black-and-White and Color Television broadcasting when specular reflections from musical instruments and football helmets, etc., are present. Most past approaches to the blooming problem have been directed toward minimizing the effect rather than eliminating the problem. This paper will discuss recent non-blooming silicon target camera tube designs that have eliminated blooming as a problem. In fact these non-blooming silicon camera tubes are now among the best camera tubes available for looking at bright lights or other high contrast scenes where it is desirable to overexpose the tube to bring out objects in the dimly illuminated position of the picture. The discussion will also include a comparison of non-blooming types to standard silicon target camera tubes."
"The phenomenon of increase in size of the image produced by a high intensity source is particularly troublesome in silicon diode array imaging devices. Although there are various causes for this \"blooming\", e.g., lens flare and beam pulling, the most prominent cause is the lateral diffusion of the excess minority carriers in the field-free region of the sensor array. When the diodes in the image are fully discharged in a time interval shorter than the frametime, the excess carriers diffuse to the adjacent diodes and cause an increase in the size of the image. It will be shown theoretically how blooming is related to the effective minority carrier lifetime which is a function of surface recombination velocity at the imaging side of the target, surface recombination velocity at the diode side of the target, and bulk minority carrier lifetime."
"A new television camera tube the \"Chalnicon\" has been developed. The tube is a vidicon-type camera tube using a CdSe photoconductive layer as target material and has many excellent features; extremely high sensitivity, low dark current and good spectral response for visible light. An improved target structure has been employed in order to use the CdSe layer which has insufficient dark resistivity to operate as the target in the conventional structure. In the \"Chalnicon\", the light-electricity conversion is accomplished by the CdSe layer. Storage of the electric charge signal is accomplished by a second layer. The separation of these functions into two different layers makes it possible to utilize the highly sensitive CdSe layer as the target material of the camera tube."
"Pyroelectric vidicons for infrared imaging applications have recently been reported. Some of the advantages these appear to offer are low cost, good resolution with moderate sensitivity, and room temperature operation. A target material useful in these camera tubes is triglycine sulfate (TGS). With this material, resolution capabilities up to 200 TV lines/ picture height have been demonstrated. In the preferred cathode potential stabilized (CPS) mode, it is necessary to provide a mechanism for removal of electrons from the TGS surface to prevent excess charging. This removal has been provided by positive ions generated in tubes which produce a pedestal current (i.e., an equivalent dark current) with less than optimum vacuum conditions."
"An electronically scanned image dissecting panel has been used for the first time to produce real-time millimeter wave image conversion at 94 GHz. Reflected energy from illuminated targets at 1 to 3 meters range was optically imaged on the face of a 20 × 20 array of large p-i-n diodes mounted in a panel. The diodes were fabricated from high resistivity silicon and measured .5 cm wide by .05 cm thick between contacts by .376 cm deep in the direction of rf transmission. Image dissection was achieved by switching the diodes between high and low conductivity states permitting rf transmission to a single crystal detector placed 10\" to 20\" behind the panel. A TV like display of the millimeter wave image was generated by applying the detected signal to the Z axis of a CRT. Frame rates up to 35 frames per second were obtained."
"A high radiance GaAs laser operating at room temperature, has been developed under contract to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for use in an optical space navigation system. To achieve high radiance a single, 300 microns wide, GaAs diode is confined to the lowest-order transverse mode. This is accomplished by operating the laser diode with its mirror faces anti-reflection coated in an optical cavity in which the transverse mode is controlled by an aperture limiting slit. The asymmetry and small size of the active region and the very low impedance of the GaAs laser diode presented serious problems in designing a rugged and efficient device."
"The spectral and temporal output of a CW pumped, doubly resonant parametric oscillator (DRO) are reported. The DRO consists of a Ba2- NaNb5O15crystal in a hemispherical cavity with mirrors coated for degenerate operation; the pump radiation is 5145Å from a continuous argon ion laser. Pump feedback is eliminated by the use of Faraday rotator, and cavity length changes are minimized by coupling together the components of the DRO. The output of the oscillator is analyzed with a 1.0 meter spectrometer (.5Å resolution) and a streak camera with an S-1 response and 20 nsec temporal resolution. The experimental results show that for pump powers just above threshold, the DRO operates on a single cluster of modes for the duration of one scan. Mode jumping occurs on most scans and large frequency sweeps can also be observed. At higher pump powers (2-3 times above threshold), another cluster of signal modes starts to oscillate, sometimes simultaneously with the first cluster. This second cluster occurs at the next coincidence of signal-idler pairs for which ωp- ωso- ωio= 0. For all of these pump powers, oscillation in higher transverse order modes is observed; these can be eliminated by use of an aperture within the DRO cavity. Sources of these frequency instabilities and their interpretation will be discussed."
"Stablized, single-frequency Nd:YAG lasers are of current interest for use in communication systems, holography and parametric converters. Stabilization requires a frequency discriminant which is characteristically provided by a high finesse passive Fabry-Perot cavity in a wide bandwidth control loop to compensate for short-term frequency fluctuations and an atomic line discriminant to maintain long-term stability. This scheme, used successfully with gas lasers, is not directly applicable to the Nd:YAG laser due to the absence of narrow line width absorbers near the 1.06 micron operating range. There are, however, numerous absorption lines of iodine at the frequncy doubled wavelength of the Nd:YAG laser."
"Thermo-optic perturbations, i. e., depolarization and phase-front distortion, have been recognized as tha main limitation in achieving efficient TEM∞mode operation in cw or high pulse rate solid-state lasers. Previous investigations dealt with the principal nature of these effects by simply assuming uniform volumetric heating of the laser rod. In studying cw-pumped Nd:YAG systems, we found, however, that in order to relate the distrotion to the TEM∞performance, a more realistic thermal model must be adopted. Most significant is the radial fall-off in pump intensity and hence heat generation inside the cylindrical laser rod since (a) the depolarization depends strongly on the form of the thermal profile, and (b) a non-quadratic phase-front component is introduced. Analytical expressions for both types of resonator losses are presented and their effect on the TEM∞mode will be discussed. By employing a concave-convex resonator to obtain a large volume inside the active material, we observed that a critical mode diameter exists above which the increase in thermo-optic loss outweighs the gain in mode volume. For this optimum configuration, 2.5 watts of TEM∞power was obtained with an efficiency of 1/3 percent compared to 8 watts of multimode power from the same system. The three main loss components relating to scattering-absorption, depolarization and phase-front distortion were experimentally determined. Excellent agreement with the calculated loss values was observed. An evaluation of these findings aimed at an optimum TEM∞laser design will be presented."
"Simultaneous utilization of both loss and phase modulation to mode lock a Nd:YAG laser produces superior performance to that obtained with either modulation technique individually. While the Nd:YAG laser can be mode locked using either phase modulation or loss modualtion, each of these techniques has its inherent disadvantages. Phase modulation allows the possibility of a phase ambiguity in the mode-locked pulse train, while loss modulators rarely have sufficiently large modulation depth, particularly at higher mode-locking frequencies, to produce stable, relaxation-oscillation-free, mode-locked operation. Several techniques have been suggested by various authors to eliminate the ambiguity associated with phase modulation. None of these works well with an internally frequency-doubled laser since intra-cavity frequency doubling encourages the phase ambiguity since by reducing harmonic conversion efficiency. When the laser is mode locked using simultaneous loss and phase modulation, however, the pulse train phase ambiguity is removed and the laser exhibits the desirable characteristics of both mode-locking techniques."
"We report a novel approach for increasing GaAlAs diode optical power output efficiency by utilizing a solid half cylinder for diode index matching and as a pumping cavity reflector. The solid half cylinder is 5cm in diameter and 6.5 cm long and has a refractive index, n = 1.82. Its outside and end surfaces have been optically polished and gold coated. There are two grooves parallel to the diameter separated 5mm apart for bonding diode array and laser rod. The interfaces between the cylinder and diodes were filled by either low melting point high index glass (n = 2.2) or Lens Bond adhesive (n = 1.55). Laser rods were glued on the cylinder by Lens Bond. The use of these adhesive reduces the Fresnel reflection between interfaces and increase diode efficiency. The theoretical improvements for laser pumping rate are 323 percent for n = 1.55 and 517 percent for n = 2.2."
"A GaAlAs semiconductor-pumped Nd:YAG laser is described which has produced more than 80 mW of CW power in the TEM∞mode at a wavelength of 1.06 micrometers. The laser was optically pumped by a 7.5-cm linear array of 120 domed GaAlAs light-emitting diodes operating at room temperature and driven at a current of 250 mA. In earlier experiments, comparable diodes operated under these conditions have exhibited more than 7500 hours of operation with less than 10 percent degradation. Output power from the diode array was coupled to a 1.5-mm-diameter by 7.5- cm-long Nd:YAG rod by a gold-coated hemielliptical reflector. Temperature of the rod was controlled by thermoelectric modules and could be varied from room temperature to -22°C. The diodes, mounted along one axial focus of the elliptical reflector, were maintained near room temperature by circulating room-temperature water through the array heat-sink. The array was fabricated in a modular fashion using 15 subarray modules of eight diodes each. An array packing density of 72 percent was achieved. Average power efficiency of the 18-mil-diameter hemispherical diodes was 4.74 percent. The array produced 2.29 watts of optical pump power with a peak wavelength of 8080 Å and a spectral half-width of 255 Å."
"CCD shift registers constructed using double level aluminum metallization are described. The insulation between the two metallization layers is anodized aluminum. The double level metallization relaxes the 2.5 micron tolerance required for single level metallization definition. This fabrication technique provides a simple quick method for forming the double level insulation where the thickness of the Al2O3forms the interelectrode gap. The double level structure seals the interelectrode gap from ambient effects and provides a coplanar high conductivity metallization system on both levels. The technique requires only one additional photomask over those needed for single level metallization. The Al2O3insulation thickness used has ranged from 700 Å to 6000 Å and is both electrically insulating (less than 10 µA/cm2at 40V) and physically hard."
"Modern photolithographic technology offers the capability of fabricating MOSFET devices of micron dimensions and less. It is by no means obvious that such small devices can be designed with suitable electrical characteristics for LSI switchivg applications. In this talk we will describe short-channel devices (L_{eff} \\sim 1µ) designed by scaling down larger devices with desirable electrical characteristics. Lateral and vertical dimensions, doping level, and operating voltages and currents are scaled in a self-consistent fashion. In this way small devices have been fabricated without the usual deleterious effects associated with short channels. The measured characteristics of these short-channel devices and the larger devices from which they were scaled will be compared."
"A new type of Floating Si-Gate Tunnel Injection MIS (FTMIS) memory devide that switches within the nanosecond range was fabricated. The write/erase time of this device is found to be almost two orders of magnitude shorter than MAOS or MNOS devices. This device consists of a silicon substrate, oxide (20-40 Å), highly resistive polycrystalline silicon film (200-1000 Å) as a floating gate, gate oxide (800-1500Å), and gate electrode. Most conventional tunnel injection memory devices utilize traps distributed near the insulator-insulator interface as the site of charge storage. This limits the switching speed. In our structure, the floating gate overcomes this weak point and the transition time constant depends only on the thin tunnelable oxide thickness. The FTMIS device features high-speed write and erase (<20ns), rectangular hysteresis loop, large difference between on/off levels (Δ Vth\\lsim 50V) and semipermanent retention (similar to MNOS). The gate oxide is formed by thermal oxidation of the upper part of the floating gate in an island structure. Thus leakage through pinholes has little influence on memory retention."
"Development of new semiconductor technologies frequently requires impurity density analysis on material with high leakage currents or deep level contamination. Previously described impurity profilers provide no diagnostics for such cases. We have constructed a new variable-frequency capacitance/conductance analysis system applicable to impurity profile. Schottky barrier height, MOS interface state and deep level analysis. The system, which consists almost entirely of commercial \"building blocks\", uses phase-sensitive detection to provide better than 40dB isolation between capacitance and conductance signals. For impurity profile measurements a two-frequency intermodulation technique avoids the stringent filtering requirements inherent in the Copeland plotter. In this mode the system can measure either capacitance, C and dC/dV or conductance, G and dG/dV over two decades in frequency. A small-scale analog computer integral with the unit allows presentation of the data as impurity profiles. A simple change of circuit parameters permits measurement of C or G with amplitude response flat within 1% over four decades of frequency. The computer may then be used to present the results in formats appropriate to Schottky barrier height or deep level determinations."
"Capacitance and conductance of junction devices are modified by deep lying impurities in the semiconductor and should therefore in principle be useful for determining deep level parameters, viz, the concentration, the depth of the energy level from the conduction band and the capture cross section of the impurity species present. However, the presence of deep lying impurities in junction devices has been frequently ignored because of difficulties in handling the problem. We show that when deep lying impurities act as majority carrier traps expressions for capacitance and conductance (imaginary capacitance) can be obtained as a solution of a simple different equation."
"LPE magnetic garnet films are now being grown with magnetic defect densities less than 10/cm2and with a high degree of reproducibility. Attention is now being directed toward developing optimum garnet film compositions for specific device applications. The europium-yttrium garnet system has been found to be suitable for 1-5µm diameter bubbles, has a low temperature sensitivity, and may be used for devices operating at frequencies up to 500 KHZ."
"Surfaces of GaAs1-xPx, where x-ranged from zero to unity, were oxidized by means of an oxygen plasma producing transparent and electrically insulating oxide films. The oxide growth rate approached one micron per second and the base material could be masked from oxidation by aluminum films. Electron beam diffraction analysis indicate that the films are polycrystalline and complex consisting of β - Ga2O3, and GaAsO4or GaPO4. Initially β - Ga2O3formed while GaAsO4or GaPO4appear in the latter growth stages. The index of refraction of the films measured at λ = 5461 Å was found to depend upon both the film thickness and the composition of the substrate material. Step etching techniques indicate the index of refraction increases gradually with distance from the surface to the bulk of the oxide."
"The compatibility of Schottky diodes with planar integrated circuit technology has led recently to their widespread use as clamping diodes for npn switching transistors. The authors have extended this idea to the fabrication of pnpn switches and studied the transient and d-c characteristics of such a structure. In the device fabricated, an Al-Si Schottky diode is connected between the two bases with the cathode of the diode common with the base of a lateral pnp transistor. By preventing saturation from occurring in either transistor, the Schottky diode causes the pnpn switch to have much shorter recovery times (measured in the order of tens of nanoseconds) than conventional unclamped pnpn switches. Various methods of turn-off and terminal bias affect the values of the recovery time as well as other important switching times."
"Most varactors used in millimeter-wave components have been GaAs devices. We have developed planar silicon P-N junction varactors whose rf performance exceeds or compares favorably to the best available GaAs devices. This advance has been made possible primarily due to low-temperature ( < 1000°C) precision fabrication processes which allow minimization of undesirable device parasitics. The varactor fabrication process utilizes ion-beam machining and ion-implantation, combined with the best state of the art in silicon epitaxy. The toatl device process is a batch process with unprecedented uniformity and reproducibility."
"This paper presents experimental and analytical work on the application of microstrip exponentially tapered lines (METL) to microwave power transistor characterization and evaluation. Previous published work on tapered transmission lines has dealt mainly with their properties as filters, or as transitions between uniform lines of differing characteristic impedances. This article treats the METL as a transformer for complex (not only real) loads."
"Lateral complementary pairs of SCL transistors have been fabricated on high resistivity substrates with three masking steps including metallization. Both NPN and PNP transistors exhibit a very high current gain in the microampere current region. The complementary pairs were operated as inverters at a power level as low as 6µW with a power supply voltage of 0.6V. The delay times per stage with 0.6 and 0.9V supply voltages were 80 and 50ns, respectively, with a 2pf load. Complementary flip-flops of SCL transistors require only a 0.3 7V supply voltage with a standby power of 35nW. The complementary pairs have very low capacitances. The ft's of the complementary pair are about 700 MHz in the micro-ampere current region. The device and wiring capacitances can be further reduced to about 1% of the conventional bipolar capacitance."
"The purpose of this paper is to present and compare three distinct phototransistor models deemed suitable for analyzing the behavior of this device in the charge-storage mode of operation. The models are derived from a common basis by utilizing a set of relationships proposed by Giacoletto for describing large-signal behavior of a bipolar transistor, modified to account for photogenerated carriers. The resulting models, of varying degrees of complexity, are all mathematically tractable."
"An integrated circuit inductance is avoided as much as possible, since it is almost impossible to make inductance element in integrated circuits. Though many kinds of attempts to make semiconductor inductance element have been reported, as of now, no product feasible for practical application has been available. The greatest problems in making a semiconductor inductance has been that of reaching a high Q value without affecting the stability of inductance against temperature changes."
"The development of a dual-mode traveling wave tube amplifier will be described. The device combines some of the most advanced design features devised to-date, to achieve what amounts to a breakthrough in rf performance. Relevant portions of the design approach will be discussed, as well as some of the obstacles encountered during: development. The tube incorporates shadow grid electron gun control, a SmCoPPM-focusing stack and a conduction-cooled, single-stage depressed collector."
"The design and performance of a gridded, high power coupled-cavity TWT will be discussed. This x-band tube operates at 50 kW peak power output over a 10% bandwidth with 60 dB gain. Average powers greater than 10 kW have been obtained. The tube uses special construction techniques to achieve a compact configuration of gun and slow wave circuit, suitable for use with a small diameter, separately wound solenoid. The non-intercepting gridded gun utilizes a dimpled cathode. It has a high area convergence ratio and a high mu. A space harmonic coupled cavity circuit is used. It is constructed in rectangular form to achieve accuracy in tolerances and a compact outer diameter. Sever loads are waveguide terminations which use high thermal conductivity lossy tapered ceramics. The gun and circuit, including the sever loads and input waveguide, fit into a two inch I.D. solenoid. Loading of the circuit for band-edge stability will be described."
"The use of moving fluids in a hollow helix structure supported by hollow ceramics is shown to simultaneously provide helix cooling, selective losses for suppressing backward wave oscillations, and low dielectric loading. The same structure using a different fluid is a high-power attenuator. The 50 PSI input fluid passes through parallel hollow ceramic supports into and through a half-turn of the hollow helix and then out through other ceramic supports on the opposite side of the helix to the fluid output. The effect of the fluid in the helix is to provide excellent cooling (1500 watts/inch at 20°C rise in the fluid) with a large safety factor. The RF losses of the fluid in the ceramics are dependent upon the wall thickness of the ceramic and the electrical conductivity of the fluid. Using water as the coolant in a specific design provides a highly frequency-selective loss which prevents backward-wave oscillations. A slight modification of ceramic inner dimension and utilization of a higher conductivity fluid provides an attenuator capable of dissipating over 5 kilowatts."
"A traveling wave tube has been developed to deliver 1 kW peak power at 10% duty cycle over the 8-16 GHz frequency band. The tube has a micro-perveance 1 electron gun with a high mu control grid and is PPM focused with samarium cobalt magnets. Many of the techniques which have proven successful in high power CW TWT's are incorporated in this design. These include vertebrae construction, body cooling fins, and domed output antenna. Electronic efficiency in excess of 11% has been achieved over most of the band. Midband electronic efficiency of 16.5% has been observed. Single stage depressed collector operation increases overall efficiency to over 20%."
"The efficiency and gain of a power output tube are important parameters in determining the overall size and power consumption of a radar transmitter chain. Hitherto, high efficiency has only been obtained in travelling wave tubes at relatively low power levels and limited gain. This paper describes the application of efficiency enhancement techniques to higher power levels with the achievement of 50% efficiency in a 350 kW, G-band, pulsed travelling wave tube having 30 dB minimum gain. The tube uses a cloverleaf circuit with a single sever, a velocity tapered output section and a two stage depressed collector."
"Design and performance characteristics are presented for a high-power bar-line-type traveling wave tube: TOP 1304. Peak power up to 220 kW and average power of 2.5 kW have been measured on a 15% bandwidth. The tube utilizes a sturdy copper delay line derived from French TPOMI (M-type traveling wave tubes) bar lines, the TWT is operated in the fundamental space harmonic. Although the beam is solenoid focused, a PPM system with conventional magnetic material could be integrated with the tube because of the small outside diameter of the delay line."
"A 20 × 20 self scanned optical imaging array was designed and fabricated on a 102 × 102 mils chip using the silicon gate technology. The array consists of 400 optical sensing charge coupled units accessed by two novel 20 bit shift registers. The shift registers are charge coupled devices and employ a new technique to give a serial to parallel output for every bit. The basic optical unit consists of a silicon gate integrating electrode, two x and y transfer silicon gate electrodes and a p+diffusion which acts as a common output for the entire line. The organization and design considerations of the array will be described. Experimental results on the basic optical unit which include noise equivalent power, photosensitivity as a function of integration time and spectral response will be given."
"A charge coupled image sensor to be used in conventional television applications has to be read out in two progressively scanned, 2:1 interlaced fields. A difficulty arises in frame transfer imaging devices, since they are basically shift registers that move the whole charge pattern in unison. A modified form of interlacing has been devised which offers a resolution per scan line in the display that is comparable to what is produced in an electron beam scanned arrangement. Each charge transfer cell is elongated in the vertical direction to cover the distance corresponding to two scan lines in the display. The information to be presented in two consecutive fields is integrated underneath different sets of electrodes, within this stretched resolution cell, to match the center of charge collection with the corresponding location of the scan line in the display. Several implementations of this scheme have been tested experimentally and compared to the theoretical resolution limit."
"A summary of the progress at Texas Instruments in CCD imaging is presented. Results obtained with both long linear imagers and large area arrays are described. Critical optical parameters studied are sensitivity, modulation transfer function (MFT), dynamic range (gray shades), linearity, blooming, spectral response, element uniformity and response time. The electrical characteristics studied include charge transfer efficiency versus frequency, storage time, clocking requirements, power dissipation, and noise. The influence of these electrical characteristics on optical parameters is described. Fabricational techniques are discussed which optimize optical and electrical performance of CCD imagers with resonable device yields."
"We present the analysis, design, fabrication and evaluation of low light level, anti-blooming, charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensors in line and area arrays. The transfer of low light level charge is determined by the non-linear electric field beneath the gate electrode. The CCD image sensor array is analyzed with a figure-of-merit which is the product of signal-to-noise (S/N) and modulation transfer function (MFT). The noise equivalent signal (NES), S/N = 1, is formulated at the system output and referenced to the readout diode. The CCD arrays use a 2-phase, stepped-oxide, clock system with interline transfer. Front surface imaging is achieved with thin silicon-gate electrodes (1000-2000 Å) which also serve as a \"field shield\" and the bottom layer of the lower phase line. The lowerphase line is constructed with an aluminum-silicon sandwich to provide low charging time constants (< 5 nsec) and reduce the incidence of phase line-to-line substrate shorts over large areas. The upper phase line is aluminum and a 3rd level aluminum forms a light shield over the interline shift-registers and CMOS readout circuit. The latter in combination with an analog signal processor provides a low-noise, composite video output signal. A unique cell design is used to combine active CCD sensor, interline shift-register, transfer gate and \"stopper\" diffusions into compact 2 mil centers in the area array. 1 × 128 element line arrays and 75 × 100 element area arrays are discussed in terms of individual elements NES, responsivity and spectral response."
"In practical applications charge-coupled imagers (CCI's) should be immune to picture degradation due to excessive local optical overloads while maintaining large dynamic range. Our analysis shows that a 500 × 500 CCI will have a sensitivity approaching the I-SIT (within a factor of 10) and an intra scene dynamic range of approximately 1000:1 for a scene contrast of 0.2. However, to maintain useful operation under excessive local overloads (up to 105), some type of blooming control is required which is capable of removing the excess charge from the photosensitive area. Two general categories of blooming ccntrol structures for charge-coupled area sensors with illuminated registers will be described. Operation, design tradeoffs, and experimental data will be presented for: (a) blooming control structures which are process-compatibile with single-metal 3-phase CCI's, and (b) for blooming control structures more suitable for sealed channel, silicon gate, 2-phase CCI's. Blooming control methods will also be described for sensors having separate photodiodes with nonilluminated registers."

"An urban multipath propagation experiment, involving the simultaneous transmission from a fixed site of 100-ns pulses at 488, 1280, and 2920 MHz and their reception at a mobile van, is described. A statistical analysis of the data in the resulting multipath responses is given and used as a basis for a statistical model of urban multipath propagation."
"The results of experimentally based computer simulations of phase-ranging and pulse-ranging urban vehicle-monitoring systems are given. These show that such systems are quite feasible even in the worst environments."
"The objective of a traffic-adjusted arterial control system is to minimize travel time along the artery. Such traffic characteristics as volume, road occupancy, or vehicle speed are sensed for both outbound and inbound traffic. These data lead to the selection of a pre-computed strategic plan of the system cycle length, offsets, and splits which matches the current demand and trend of traffic, possibly for a period of 10 min, at the end of which another strategic selection will be made. Arterial control forms the basis of multi-intersection signal-control systems. The implementation of arterial traffic-control systems will be described with strong emphasis on hardware aspects."
"The statistical properties of radio propagation between a mobile unit and a base-station terminal are derived. The power spectrum of the transmission coefficient in the multipath medium is used to determine probability distributions of amplitude and phase, correlations of fields versus time and space at mobile and base stations, level-crossing rates and durations of fades, and random frequency modulation. Duality between the power spectrum and density of time delays is shown. The correlations versus frequency and the coherence bandwidth then follow from the density of time delays. The performance of standard diversity systems is then predicted. There is a review of results previously presented by Clarke [1], however, the derivations given herein utilize expressions of the power spectrum rather than expressions of the component waves. The power-spectral approach, used throughout, allows direct application of previous statistical analyses, particularly those of Rice [2]."
"A set of linear formulas are derived for estimating the most probable location of a vehicle in a metropolitan area by trilateration techniques, given that multipath introduces errors in range measurements. These formulas are applied to a phase-ranging system (although they are also applicable to pulse-ranging systems), and the results obtained suggest that the probability of large location errors may be too high for many applications of interest."

"Mobile radio propagation tests were carried out at 836 MHz from a base station in downtown Philadelphia, Pa., to a mobile which traveled on the city streets. It was found that the median signal power tends to fall off as R-3for distances greater than 1 to 2 mi from the base station antenna. The mean received-signal level was found to be approximately log-normally distributed with a standard deviation varying from 5 to 10 dB, where the higher values were observed close to the base station."
"A one-year study indicates that low cost, excellent coupling characteristics, and ability to serve vehicles on two closely spaced guideways make the Goubau surface-wave transmission fine an attractive solution to the high-speed ground transportation communications problem. Further testing in a real environment should be undertaken to prove or disprove the encouraging results obtained experimentally with the 918-ft prototype line used in this study."
"Radio signals received by moving vehicles in mountainous regions or in cities with high buildings may exhibit violent amplitude fluctuations because of the existence of standing-wave patterns. An energy-density antenna which samples the electromagnetic energy density has been suggested as a means for combatting this spatial fading phenomenon. A unipole and crossed slots combination with suitable circuitry serves as a novel and convenient energy-density antenna. Using a simple reflecting-plane model, the range of amplitude variation of the receiver output as a function of signal direction is examined."
"The design of future mobile radio systems will be based upon an estimated user demand. Systems probably will be engineered to serve the \"average business day\" spatial distribution of call attempts, which for the purpose of this study was assumed to be uniform. There will be day-to-day fluctuations about this long-term average, the magnitudes of which are only to be conjectured at this time. This paper compares the performance of computer simulated mobile radio systems operating with several demand profiles. The profiles were selected to give an indication of the effects on system performance of either uncompensated changes in average traffic or normal fluctuations which occur in the randomly offered traffic even when the long-term average value does not change. The dynamic channel assignment systems increased the traffic capacity at low blocking levels even over a perfectly designed fixed channel assignment system. In addition, it was found that the dynamic channel assignment systems were relatively insensitive to the periodic spatial demand distributions studied by this computer simulation. Even though new call attempts were made to fluctuate markedly between adjacent base stations within a reuse interval, the blocking rate of each base station remained constant. It appears that the blocking rate within a reuse interval depends (in the dynamic channel assignment systems) mainly on the average demand within that interval and not very strongly upon the distribution of that demand. In the fixed channel assignment system, uncompensated fluctuations in the spatial demand distribution away from the design value always degrade system performance."
"An automatic car-following system based on optimal control theory is developed for a variety of cost functionals and the resultant system is simulated on an analog computer. Position and velocity response as well as local and asymptotic stability characteristics of a string of vehicles are examined. String behavior when a vehicle leaves or enters the string is also considered. By proper choice of the cost functional, it is shown that a car-following system can be obtained which meets the outlined objectives. Various forms of cost functionals are investigated in order to determine their effect on system performance."

"A new concept of urban transportation in which vehicles are operated on a computer-guided road network is presently being evolved. Such a system, in miniature, was demonstrated at the Automobile Pavilion at Expo'70, which was held in Japan. The \"traffic game\" is played on a 25-by 25-m chessboard-like field where visitors can drive two-passenger cars. The cars are individually controlled by a computer in the control center, in contrast to conventional traffic systems. The control system guides the cars to their destination, prevents accidents, and controls cars in emergencies. It fullfils the functions which are important in a future urban traffic-control system. The system gives passengers driving freedom to preserve driving pleasure. The system successfully demonstrated the advantages of an individually controlled vehicle system for future urban traffic to many visitors to the Expo. In designing this traffic game system, there were discussions on a number of problems which are likely to arise during its implementation on a large scale."
"A vehicle location system concept which utilizes narrow-band-radio trilateration has been developed for use in command and control systems designed to dispatch mobile vehicles. A comprehensive system experiment was carried out in Schenectady, N.Y., designed to evaluate the system's performance in a severe radio multipath environment, and to evaluate the improvement in performanee realized by system design options developed to improve performance degradation of multipath, that is, redundant receiving stations and space diversity antennas. Experimental results from the system experiment show that although high instrumental precision can be realized by narrow-band-radio trilateration techniques, a severe multipath environment, such as the Schenectady area produces by surrounding hills and valleys, degrades the instrumental precision. The results also indicate that four receiving stations each having four space diversity antennas will improve performance yielding a total vehicle location error radius of 900 ft, which is standard deviation for the Schenectady area."
"A small-diameter tubular test chamber lined with lossy material (ferrite) has been developed for indoor tuning and testing of the base-isolation and impedance-correcting networks of a VHF whip antenna covering the frequency band from 30 to 76 MHz. Results of experimental evaluation of the chamber which attest to its usefulness in production tuning, power testing, and field maintenance servicing of the antenna assembly are presented."
"One of the most common problems facing present-day communicators in developed and developing nations is the maximal utilization of the radio frequency spectrum. In this area, one of the most pressing problems is the requirement for a model that will provide a suitable indicator of performance for receivers that are mobile, in uncertain locations, or dispersed over a known area. Examples of these are mobile receivers and broadcast receivers. The problem is further complicated by the fact that present available data for management of the radio spectrum is very limited, and, for the case of prime interest in our study, does not include any appreciable amount of receiver data. One of the requirements for the model was that it utilize a minimal amount of data commensurate with what is readily available. The model described herein provides a probability of interference based on the geographical aspects of the problem. It allows for the addition of temporal data (duty cycles, etc.) if such data is available. The model allows for management of the spectrum based on technical considerations of compatibility and, as such, could be a key aspect of the development of spectrum management at a national level."

"A vehicle-location system operating at X band is described. For certain applications, a precise absolute measure of position is not needed. It suffices to determine a vehicle's location only to within a zone. For those systems which require zonal location information only, an \"electronic fence\" approach is well suited. In this approach, zone boundaries are defined by an array of transmitters. These transmitters, of low power and limited range, continuously emit digitally coded messages (identifying the zone) which are received and stored in the vehicle's receiver. When the vehicle's location is desired, a separate radio data channel is used for interrogation, whereupon the vehicle responds with the last stored message corresponding to the zone presently occupied. The transmitter and receiver portions of the locator were implemented using microwave components and both analog and digital integrated circuits. Although the unit has been designed and tested for a zonal fence configuration, it can easily be used as a basic sensor element in any other vehicle-locator system of the proximity type."
"In a small-cell mobile-radio system different base stations transmit different signals simultaneously, and at the same carrier frequency, to mobile vehicles in their respective cells. It is desirable that these cochannel stations be placed as close to one another as possible without creating undue interference. However, as a vehicle moves within a cell, both the desired and undesired signals exhibit Rayleigh (local) fading, creating a relatively high probability that the interference exceeds the signal. On the other hand, at the frequencies contemplated it is relatively simple to construct additional antennas that provide independently fading signals, thereby offering the use of diversity techniques. Three different switch diversity techniques are considered, and the improvements produced by each are calculated. It is also shown that some are effective in combating an additional difficulty of the mobile-radio environment; this difficulty is that while the signal received in a moving vehicle is locally Rayleigh, the mean of this Rayleigh process changes slowly with time."
"A fixed reference control scheme for automated highways is proposed. Each vehicle controls itself; thus multiloop feedback is avoided. A simple proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is selected from many alternatives. For emergency stopping, a PI controller using a tachometer on a braked wheel can bring a vehicle with rubber tires to a controlled skid-free stop."
"Electronic clocks are rapidly becoming practical for automotive applications. These digital clocks promise not only superior timekeeping in automotive clocks, but they also could be used for a myriad of timing functions throughout the car. These range from turn signal flashers to top-speed limiting and safety-monitoring checks. Integrated circuits utilizing complementary metal oxide semiconductor devices (CMOS and silicon gate CMOS) make several system approaches feasible. This paper outlines some possible system approaches and summarizes considerations for CMOS IC's, quartz crystals, and electronic readout devices."

"Single conversion VHF/UHF receiver design have become popular in the last several years. With the advent of monolithic crystal filters and monolithic IC's, single conversion receivers can now be Justified on the basis of cost, as well as the performance improvements that result. The design of a single conversion receiver presents the designer with a far more difficult challenge than traditional double conversion designs. The fundamental receiver design rules still apply, as always. However, the attention to details is far more important to achieve success."
 "This thesis is aimed at the problem of quickly and accurately communicating digital data between fixed and mobile (either vehicle-mounted or hand-held) radio stations. Digital error is of prime concern and the effects which multipath propagation, Gaussian noise, and implusive noise have on digital errors are analyzed. The importance of other analyses such as economic factors, interrogation procedures, or analog transmission might be peculiar to land mobile communication, but the recommendations for improving the noisy, fading digital channel should have broader application and a more general appeal."
"This paper describes a system for idetifying moving objects such as vehicles, trucks, buses, containers, etc. in which a passive label having a number of dipoles in accordance with a code is attached to the object and, a synthetic aperture radar consisting of a Gunn diode mounted within a resonant cavity and connected to a horn is used to illuminate the label. The Gunn diode operates as a homodyns so that signals from the label are also detected by the diode as a number of overlapping chirp signals which are sent to a computer for processing. The computer output is a pulse train with pulses corresponding to dipoles in the label. A number of tests have been made indicating that labels can be read regardless of range and vehicle speed. A number of horns may be strategically located in a city or along a highway and these horns can be multiplexed into a common computer to provide an inexpensive all weather automatic vehicle identification system."
"Can you visualise a one man basketball team? Surely your picture of such a team includes visions of failure and defeat on the court. We all know that it takes a full team and the coordinated action of all it's members to win at basketball. The same thing is true in reference to product safety. The manufacturer is only one member of the team. As a leader in the communications field, General Electric, the manufacturing member of the team, has faced its responsibilities in this area and has given careful consideration to safety concerns in the design of its equipment. However, some safety problems are beyond the control of the radio manufacturer alone, and require action on the part of others, perhaps even you, to assure fully safe use of the radio."
  "A guidance signal for vehicle automatic longitudinal control can be obtained via two oppositely traveling waves on one or more transmission lines situated on or near a vehicle guideway. One previously suggested technique utilized the amplitude variations along the lines while that discussed here involves the phase difference between the two waves."
          "This paper presents the technical approach and results obtained in attempting to resolve the land mobile communications problems for a 1000 square mile mountainous county of Boulder in Colorado. The project was broken into three phases: (1) Planning and Prediction, (2) Measurements, and (3) Recommendations. In the planning and prediction phase a map study of Boulder county was made to determine the terrain characteristics and to identify potential base, repeater, and relay station sites. Line of sight path loss calculations were made of the extent of coverage of these sites assuming operation on 40, 160, and 420/MHz bands. The measurement phase was conducted by establishing at each of the four selected sites a receiver and strip chart recorder combination on each of the three bands considered in the planning stage. A transmitter vehicle, simultaneously transmitting on 41 MHz at 100 watts, 162 MHz at 60 watts, and 416 MHz at 30 watts with a 1 KHz tone at 4 KHz deviation, was then driven over 130 miles of both flat land and steep canyon road. The strip chart recorder recorded both signal level and audio received. Throughout the measurements, unity gain antennas and high sensitivity, less than 0.2 µv for 12 dB SINAD receivers were used."
 "A mini computer with 8K 12 bit word storage capacity is employed in direct interface with the radio base stations and vehicular data units to perform routine priority and procedural functions. 2K word locations are allocated to individual vehicle identification and the remaining 6K locations are allocated to zone identification, and program functions. Organization of the system is such that the work load is evenly distributed among the dispatchers. Driver's identification codes register automatically in a receive buffer and a return code from the computer signals a driver that his call is registered. Illustrations of the dispatcher's keyboard and display unit are shown."
  "The necessity for a low pollution engine has increased the requirement to control ignition spark advance. Seven engine parameters may need to be measured and be used to control the spark advance. The complexity of mechanical systems to control such spark advance warrants an investigation of electronic control. Electronic spark advance has been investigated with a variety of analog and digital circuits. It now appears that the PLL (Phase Locked Loop) technique offers the most promise in terms of simplicity, cost, and noise immunity. Figure 1 is a basic block diagram of a complete electronic advance ignition system."

 "Logic devices affect system design in many ways in addition to implementing the desired logic functions. With the high-speed circuits available today, the system designer must pay careful attention to the implications of the logic devices on signal interconnections, packaging and cooling as well as power generation and distribution. Wire is no longer a resistive element in the circuit; it may have significant capacitive and inductive properties at the frequencies of use. This paper considers how many of these factors are related and presents some of the approaches being made to solve these problems."
"Power reduction techniques are described for both LSI memory components and systems. These techniques have been verified experimentally for both read-only and random access read/write components using power switching circuits external to the chips. A number of ways to apply on-chip power switching are described. The power switching concept is also described for memory cards and systems that can be organized into blocks."

 "Computer architecture is a relatively recently recognized discipline. The Technical Committee on Computer Architecture (TCCA) of the Computer Society was formed in 1970 and the Special Interest Committee on Computer Architecture (SICARCH) of ACM only in the summer of 1971. It is perhaps pertinent then, to ask what computer architecture is. A dictionary (1) defines architecture as: \"the profession of designing buildings, open areas, communities, etc., usually with some regard to aesthetic effect.\" I once said (2) that computer architecture is \"the art of designing a machine that will be a pleasure to work with,\" so I would tend to go along with the dictionary."
"A good design is the Elderado in any systems area. The elements of good design include efficiency, simplicity, and flexibility for use. While we make no pretense that the ideas described in this paper are essential to good computer design, it seems to us that it does meet many of the criteria and avoids a number of the pitfalls associated with high performance computers."
"The development of computers has been influenced by three factors: the technology (i.e., the components from which we build); the hardware and software techniques we have learned to use; and the user (market). The improvements in technology seem to dominate in determining the possible resulting structures. Specifically, we can observe the evolution of four classes of computers:"
"In the beginning there was ENIAC. Then there was the 650, then the 7090 and then the 360. By any reasonable mathematics that makes four generations, but by judicious use of zero- origin indexing, we can come out with the present day machinery belonging to the third generation. In this paper, we will try to look at the next three generations of computers."
"When writing small programs, one can use many unwise practices which have little effect on whether a program meets its design objectives as long as the program works. But, when writing large programs, poor program writing techniques can increase development time and cost and can cause maintenance difficulties after development. The problem of low programmer productivity associated with membership in large programming efforts is examined. To place the problem of writing large programs into proper perspective, factors one must live with are described. Techniques for improving productivity are then presented with emphasis placed on improving communications. Areas covered are programmer education, environment, task assignment and supervision along with program organization and documentation."

"\"Minicomputers – Trends and Applications\" was the title of a symposium held at the National Bureau of Standards on March 1, 1972. Attended by a capacity audience of over 640, the symposium was sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society's Eastern Area Committee and Washington, D. C. Chapter. Chairman of the symposium was James A. Cunningham of the National Weather Service who was assisted by Program Co-chairmen Thomas N. Pyke, Jr., of NBS nd Paul L. Hazan of the Singer Company as well as other active Washington area Computer Society members. Welcoming remarks were given by Dr. Ruth M. Davis, Director of the NBS Center for Computer Sciences and Technology. The keynote address, \"Minicomputers – A Challenge in the 70's\", was presented by Kenneth Olsen, President of the Digital Equipment Corporation. Speakers and panel members were chosen to represent a broad perspective of the field. Included in the program were two panel discussions intended to furnish practical advice to users on the proper selection and use of minicomputers."

To management it represents an overhead in terms of software development and computer execution costs, an overhead whose return is sometimes obscured.

"Introduction. The first generation of general purpose computers quickly demonstrated their usefulness in handling problems involving large quantities of data with great speed and accuracy. Because of the complexity of these computers, their designers were soon enmeshed in these kinds of problems when dealing with the design data. Out of this experience was born Design Automation, which is used here to mean the art of using computers to aid in the design of computers. DA, as it is often abbreviated, might more it is often abbreviated, might more accurately stand for \"design assistance\", since the \"automation\" part relates more closely to the automatic manufacturing processes to which it supplies data, than to the design process itself."
"In this paper we review some of the recent developments in the automated design and analysis of digital systems. The areas of gate level simulation, synthesis, partitioning, interconnection and fault test generation are discussed, and new algorithms in each of these areas are presented and compared."
"The complexity of integrated circuits has increased steadily over the past several years from circuits consisting of simple gates through Medium Scale Integration (MSI) and Large Scale Integration (LSI). Fabrication techniques for LSI have evolved from well-established integrated circuit technology. Because of the large physical size and the large number of components on the individual silicon die, production techniques have been substantially improved in order to maintain reasonable yields. However, the most significant effects of LSI on the semiconductor manufacturer are in the areas of design and testing; techniques used in the past for simpler integrated circuits are inadequate for LSI."

"Since the beginning of time, man has sought knowledge to explain phenomena and new techniques to simplify his tasks. In these quests, he has ultimately dealt with four basic questions: 1) What is the problem? 2) How may the problem be solved? 3) How applicable is a given solution? and 4) Why does a solution yield a particular set of results? Technological evolution has occurred because man has been motivated to ask and resolve such questions."
"The performance of computer systems cannot be seriously and meaningfully measured unless the work- load the system is dealing with during the measurement sessions is carefully selected. Even in the case the real workload is driving the system while measurements are being performed, such questions as determining the dura- tion of a session and the intervals of system activity to be monitored arise."
"This paper describes the planning and execution of a recent experiment which utilized a hardware monitor- ing device and associated analysis programs to evaluate the performance of a computer system which is employed for real-time satellite command and control.

Communication line, processor, and channel utilization were analyzed, as was the interaction of Executive, Input/Output, and Application software modules."
 "Frequently designers of computer systems have few (if any) convenient means of investigating system per- formance during actual operation. This kind of analy- sis must, of course, take into account user demands and characteristics of the host system's hardware/software complement. Moreover such studies are complicated because they typically involve a large number of variables which, because of their random nature, do not exhibit unique values. The problem is not only to identify criteria which characterize the manner in which the system is used but also to select parameters which are readily measurable. This presentation describes the approaches employed in characterizing and instrumenting the usage and servicing capacity of two operating systems designed for use on Xerox Sigma computer systems. These operating systems are the Batch Time-sharing Monitor (BTM) and the Universal Time-sharing System (UTS). The performance monitors are designed with emphasis on sampling, sorting and ordering of statistical data. Examples of performance monitoring data are presented which were obtained from actual measurements."

"As more and more economic activity shifts to service industries, meaningful evaluation of their \"product\" is Abecoming a topic of major concern. The service organization is constantly being evaluated by its customers and it is important for management to understand bases for this evaluation. In the case of the general purpose time-sharing system, there may in fact be several different groups of users with different desires and goals. The procedures illustrated below attempt to provide management and designers of future computer systems with a structured way"
"The Statistics Gathering Package, SGP, is an information retrieval program supplemented with a variety of summarization techniques. It is used to access a data base of performance and usage information collected by OS, SMF, and LASP. SGP provides information that is needed by installation management, system programmers, consultants and computer users to make decisions."
"The high cost of modern remote communications systems dictates optimum utilization of such facilities. Design and performance evaluation of these systems must not be left to intuitive or heuristic reasoning; instead, formal procedures, both analytic and empirical, must be developed to provide well-utilized, high-performance systems. To this end a large number of techniques1,2 have been developed and emplopyed in the recent past. Among these are hardware and software monitoring, simulation, analytical modeling, and decision-theoretic approaches."

"The issue of quantitative determination of memory usage and utilization is central to multiprogramming computer systems. In such systems, one tries to improve the system performance by loading a set of independent jobs together into main memory. If the jobs have complementary resource requirements and the system is capable of parallel resource operation, the total time required to complete all jobs is less than if they were processed serially, i.e., in a uniprogramming mode. The situation is illustrated in Figure 1 showing a space-time diagram of memory occupancy, where the available memory space is dynamically covered with jobs. The term \"job\" is used in the sense of \"process\" as defined in [1], which also gives an excellent survey of related subjects. However, we restrict jobs to keep a fixed amount of memory until they are completed. Generalization of the concepts to be developed to include systems with dynamic allocation, swapping, paging is possible but not attempted here."

"The measurement of computer performance is a topic of resurgent interest both within and outside the computer community. Both the designers and users of computer systems have a continuing interest in those techniques which attempt to quantify the performance of the machines they build and program. Wherever performance measurement is applied in the design-use-evaluate cycle, it is important that the latest and most effective tools be brought to bear."

  "The computer revolution, like most revolutions, concerns a change in the decision-making structure of society. Computer technology has already had a tremendous impact in industry and government in its relatively short lifetime, and future technological advances have the potential for bringing truly incredible changes in our way of life. The issue faced by Rothman and Mossman, an issue that we all must face, is how can we guarantee that computer technology be used to the greatest benefit of society? Certainly, we have enough examples of technological advances that have been mixed blessings to society. A case in point is the automobile. If we had known a half century ago that the automobile would be a major factor in air pollution and urban sprawl, what would we have done differently to protect the health and environment of society?"

"The papers which follow are part of the technical program of the \"Islands of Applications\" conference which was held June 8-13, 1972 in Tokyo, Japan. This conference was co-sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and the United States Department of Commerce. The conference was held in conjunction with the Second United States Solo Computer Exhibition and the conference provided a forum for discussions of computer applications in many key areas. The conference technical program resulted from a joint Japanese-American effort. Dr. Hiroshi Sinkawa and the author served as conference co-chairmen. Special thanks must be given to Professor Tonau Osatake and Professor Hisao Yamada, both of the University of Tokyo, who are most helpful in obtaining session co-chairmen and papers from the Japanese authors. The conference technical program consisted of 27 papers."
"Digital computers are being applied in large numbers to air traffic control operations in the United States. By the mid-1970's, all U.S. en route traffic control centers and all busy terminals will be equipped with systems featuring digital computers which process flight plans and radar and beacon data into displays for air traffic controllers. Work is underway to further apply computers to such control functions as ground-based conflict prediction, sequencing and spacing, and flow control."
"The Hanshin Expressway Public Corporation, Osaka, Japan has been operating its traffic control system since the beginning of EXPO '70, that is, March 15, 1970 on its entire expressway systems in Osaka and Kobe. The total length of the Hanshin Expressway is now 79.6 KM and is expected to become 128 KM by 1975. This report presents some features of the control system with emphasis on its hardware system. This system at present has a digital computer, FACOM 270-30, with 65 KW core memory, various peripherals, more than 200 detectors, more than 70 variable information indication devices along the expressway and TV monitoring systems. The control system on Hanshin Expressway is designed to permit future expansions and modifications."

"The most important voting procedure traditionally utilized in the United States House of Representatives to resolve legislative issues involves a time-consuming roll call of Representatives' names. It has been recognized for a number of years that this cumbersome feature of the legislative process could be automated so that a more efficient use of Members' time would be possible. The year 1970 saw the fruition of several years' effort to achieve a broad range of Congressional reforms. Not since 1946, when important structural changes in Committees and their staffs were made, had there been a generalized reform of Congressional, procedures. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 (PL 91-510) in section 121 specifically provides that electronic equipment may be used to record votes in the. House of Representatives. The Senate, a body of only 100, has not chosen to employ automated voting procedures."
"Digital computers have become valuable assistants in the intensive care units of many American hospitals. Computerized patient monitoring systems offer the potential for improved patient care by aiding in the early identification of trends in monitored physiologic para- meters and by relieving the medical staff of many of the repetitive clerical tasks which occupy their time. Advanced monitoring systems further assist by initiating blood replacement and drug infusions under carefully controlled conditions. Consideration of several operational systems in the United States supports these concepts. A state-of-the- art intensive care unit monitoring system, currently being implemented at the National Institutes of Health, is described in depth."
"Computer-aided plotting is turning the ancient art of cartography into an exact science. Today's geologist, civil engineer, city planner, highway engineer and government cartographer have turned to small computers and digital plotters for maps that in the past were produced entirely by hand. This movement to computer-aided cartography has yielded more accurate maps faster and at lower cost."
"The earliest interactive computer graphics terminals were closely coupled to their central computers and placed heavy loads upon them for resource allocation. Two marked trends in the evolution of terminals have been a reduction of central computer load and exploitation of the increasing performance/cost ratio for terminal equipment. The trends have led to graphics terminals that operate on a stand-alone basis. The history of these trends is traced and particularly illustrated by the cases of the fully interactive, refreshed CRT GRAPHIC 21 and the simply interactive, storage CRT GRAPHIC 101 terminals."

"This paper describes two algorithms which find the visible portions of surfaces in a picture of a cluster of three-dimensional quadric patches. A quadric patch is a portion of quadric surface defined by a quadratic equation and by zero, one, or several quadratic inequalities. The picture is cut by parallel planes called scan planes. The visibility problem is solved in one scan plane at a time by making a \"good guess\" as to what is visible according to the visible portions found in the previous scan plane."
"A negative gate is a gate that can realize an arbitrary negative function (or monotone decreasing function) and a positive gate is one that can realize an arbitrary positive function (or monotone increasing function). This paper discusses methods of realizing a given logical function or a given set of logical functions using a minimum number of negative gates alone or using a minimum number of negative and positive gates."
"A transform that operates on the interconnection topology of a NAND network is presented. The output connecting a designated gate to the network is deleted and is connected instead to a number of other gates in the network. The entire transform may be specified by designating a \"transformed gate\" and a \"modified gate.\" The new connections are made and the resulting network is then simplified logically by casting out redundancy and merging gates in the network."
"A systematic approach to the location of a single failure in a combinational logic network is presented. The method utilizes only the required tests and needs no fault table. The structure of the logic network is taken into consideration when selecting the tests to be applied. For tree networks, we start from the gate that generates a primary output and sequentially trace back through the stages of the network according to a fixed set of rules. At each stage we either locate the fault or determine the direction of the trace."
"Combinational networks with no internal fan-out are considered from the point of view of testing for multiple faults. Several different approaches utilizing added inputs and observable outputs are considered and the tradeoffs are discussed."
"When two or more processors attempt to simultaneously use a functional unit (memory, multiplier, etc.), an arbiter module must be employed to insure that processor requests are honored in sequence. The design of asynchronous arbiters is complicated because multiple input changes are allowed, and because inputs may change even if the circuit is not in a stable state. A practical arbiter and its implementation are presented. Implementation of various priority rules (linear, ring, mixed) is discussed, and building large arbiters with trees of two-user arbiters is considered."
"A family of four procedures to compute the inverse 1/X of a given binary number X normalized between 0.5 and 1 is described. The quotient is obtained in redundant binary form, i.e., in a base 2 code in which digits can assume any positive or negative integer value. All methods here described can be implemented by combinatorial networks; the dividers realized in this way are very fast because all carry propagations take place at the same time."
"Feature extraction has been recognized as a useful technique for pattern recognition. Feature extraction is accomplished by constructing a mapping from the measurement space to a feature space. Often, the mapping is chosen from an arbitrarily specified parametric family by optimizing the parameters with respect to a separability criterion."
"Universal modules are presented that can be used to realize any single input-single output synchronous sequential machine in the form of a circuit in which the input signal enters only one module. Additionally, no signal in the circuit fans out to more than some bounded number of terminals where the bound depends only on the module being used. Two different realization schemes are presented. The first scheme is based on the single feedback loop circuit model. Modules are connected in a highly regular array. Inputs to the last row of the array are constant logic signals. In the second scheme, a tree of modules is connected at the back to one or more one-hot reaiizations of a machine closely related to the machine being realized. The first scheme has the advantage of yielding a circuit with a highly regular interconnections pattern. The second scheme generally requires fewer modules. The theory is easily edxtended to machines with more than one input and output."
"In this note we study the problem of fault detection in linear logic networks. We introduce the concept of error vectors that indicate how the effect of a fault propagates through a network. These vectors allow one to identify redundancies in the network as well as calculate the output of the network given a fault and an input. Problems related to fault diagnosis and the detection of multiple faults are also considered."
"One possible hardware implementation for the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of 2m samples is to have 2m-1 cells, each of which performs two of the necessary computations during each of the m passes through the processor. But in each of these m passes, each of the 2m-1cells may require a different multiplier coefficient for its computations. The two most obvious solutions are costly. The multipliers could be stored in a central memory and sent to each cell when needed; however, it takes time to transmit them and uses many pins, or interconnections between cells. Alternatively, the multipliers could be stored in a ROM in each cell. This makes each cell bigger, and the cells are no longer identical copies of one another. We consider a third possibility in this note. In each pass the multipliers are generated from the values of the multipliers used in the previous pass. This technique requires no increase in the number of pins per cell and little increase in the time required to perform the Fourier transformation."
"In the Control Data 6000 system transfers between central memory and extended core storage may be interrupted through the issuance of an exchange jump by a peripheral processor. Reinitiation of the transfer requires that it be repeated completely rather than resumed at the point of interruption. The transfer process locks out the central processing unit (CPU), so an interrupted trahsfer results in lost CPU time. In this note an estimate of this time loss as a function of interrupt rate, transfer length, and transfer initiation overhead is obtained, as well as an estimate of the transfer length which minimizes lost CPU time."
"The results of an exhaustive analysis undertaken to determine the optimum three-input logic modules are examined. The optimum logic module is restricted to realize all three-variable functions in two logic levels, with one polarity available for each input variable. Only one three-input logic module satsifies these restrictions for three variables. All realizations with the fewest logic modules and minimum number of interconnections for all three-variable functions with this logic mocOule are included in a catalog. An algorithm is presented which extends the three properties of this three-input logic module. The four-input logic module from the algorithm has been verified to realize all four-variable functions in two logic levels."
"A new proof is given for the following fact: All minimal congruences on a transition graph are of one of four types and can easily be obtained by inspecting the graph."
"Some ways of speeding up certain loops by software, firmware, and hardware means are discussed in this note. The importance of the inner loop calculation is emphasized and a simple, though as yet unused, programming technique is presented whereby the inner loop time may be reduced by approximately 20 percent. The general problem of a program with many loops is then considered and a method is indicated for obtaining the maximum speedup by means of the technique described earlier. Turning to firmware, it is shown how, by altering the normal algorithm used for the inner loop calculation, a very substantial speedup can be achieved with the use of microprogramming (above and beyond the savings in instruction decoding time). Finally, a means is considered whereby a computer can alter its own hardware, so as to achieve a speedup of several orders for loops in which the resolution of decision tables accounts for a significant portion of the iteration time."
"It is shown that the minimum canonical sum-of-products form of a given fuzzy function is the union of all its prime implicants. A reduction rule, which is necessary and sufficient, is presented that will generate all the prime implicants."
"A concept of functional transformation of multivalued switching functions, used to obtain simplified implementations is presented. Given some function f, a transformed function g is generated from f by permuting some or all of the truth values. Then, implementing g and performing a reverse permutation, a simpler implementation for f is obtained. A P matrix technique is given to facilitate determination of the required permutation."

"Since IBM's introduction of the System/360 and its operating system OS/360, probably no other aspect of that vast collection of programs and publications—the IBM OS Bibliography alone runs to 100 pages—has caused more heated discussions or been as poorly understood by its users as the job control language JCL. It is the one feature of the operating system that all users must employ: it is the gateway to the goodies of OS. JCL is not a programming language in the usual sense; it is not translated into machine instructions. Nor is it a command language, wherein each statement causes a specific action to take place. JCL is a job description language; it is a language used by the programmer to describe to the machine's operating system the work he has for it to do. To the System/360 operating system, a job is completely described by specifying a sequence of programs to be executed and, for each program, a list of external data sets required. Because there are so many possible combinations of programs and data, programs with all the various constraints applicable to them, data sets that can reside on any of a number of different devices, and often in different ways on the same device, because of all these possibilities and because JCL avoids making assumptions about what the programmer intends, the job descriptions expressed in JCL often require considerable detail."
"The authors' compiler generator is a translator-writing system (TWS) based on their derivative of PL/I called XPL. Of course, XPL is designed to be self-compiling. The book can be viewed either as a User's Manual for the XPL system or as an introduction to the construction of TWS's. These dual approaches complement each other since one provides the illustration of the theoretical principles studied in the other."
"This book represents a major contribution to the study of the architecture of computer systems. It will be, I believe, must reading for any serious student of the field."
"This worthwhile book is addressed to the computer user, but has much to offer others interested in computers for the 70's. It contains 13 separately authored papers from the Seventh Informatics, Inc. Symposium on Information Processing. In Isaac L. Auerbach's contribution, there is a statement that summarizes the general tone of the total book, namely, In the past, we have been over-optimistic in short-term forecasts of our accomplishments and, on the other hand, have grossly underestimated long-term accomplishments, particularly regarding the growth and application areas of the computer industry. Considering the nature of our technology, I feel that our crystal ball will be just as cloudy in the 1970's as it has been in the past two decades."

"A general class of adaptive replacement schemes for use in paged memories is developed. One such algorithm, called SIM, is simulated using a probability model that generates memory traces, and the results of the simulation of this adaptive scheme are compared with those obtained using the best nonlookahead algorithms. A technique for implementing this type of adaptive replacement algorithm with state of the art digital hardware is also presented."
"The problem of designing a minimum cost network with multipoint linkages which connects several remote terminals to a data processing center is studied. The important aspects of a teleprocessing network are queue behavior at the terminals and the cost and reliability of the entire system. In this paper it is assumed that the rate and manner in which information is requested at the terminals is known and that acceptable line loadings are given. An algorithm that determines (in principle) the optimum minimum cost network subject to reliability constraints is developed. A heuristic based on Vogel's approximation method (VAM) and two other heuristics presented by Martin and Esau-Williams were compared with each other and with the optimal algorithm. The Esau-Williams heuristic seems to be the one that gives the best solution and Martin's requires the least processing time. It is shown experimentally that Martin's and Esau-Williams heuristics are, in fact, near-optimal heurstics in the sense that the solutions provided by these heuristics are generally very near the optimal solution. In this paper we make the assumption that all lines of the network have the same capacity."
"This paper fornulates a state-space model for linear iterative circuits having more than one spatial dimension. A new type of matrix operation is introduced that allows treatment of such models in a relatively straightforward manner. Finally, a form for the general response is developed in terms of this new matrix operation."
"An analysis of the state structure and of the autonomous behavior of iterative systems belonging to the class of one-dimensional unidirectional single-output autonomous iterative arrays with one intercell lead and the cell structure of a linear sequential machine (LSM) is presented. An algorithm is developed for computing the state structure of any such iterative system with the cell structure of a minimal LSM. Another algorithm computes the cycle structure of the output sequences generated by any such iterative system, with the cell structure of an arbitrary single-input single-output LSM."
"This paper deals with the synthesis of two-level networks of threshold gate logic elements for realization of nonlinearly separable switching functions. The realization obtained contains the minimum number of threshold logic elements possible for a two-level realization. An algorithm based on the tree procedure of Coates and Lewis is developed which can be used to obtain the desired network realization for a given switching function. The function may be incompletely specified."
"This paper presents a new algorithm Amfor the synthesis of minimum gate costs TANT networks. This algorithm, which differs in the setting up of the CC table from the known Gimpel's algorithm [1], has some very advantageous features, both in its hand solution and the computer realization. The final stage of this synthesis is the solution of the CC table."
"A production on T* is a rewriting rule σα→σ' for all aϵ T*, where σ, σ' are strings in T* with a' lexicographically earlier than σ. Any finite collection of productions is called a system. This note shows that any system that is consistent, complete, and has the nonprefix property uniquely represents an automaton. This formulation characterizes automata as recognition devices in terms of a set of rewriting rules, similar to the characterizatibn of automata as generating devices by grammars."
"A modified binary-weighted resistor multiplying digital-to-analog (MDAC) converter with a full scale (±12 V) analog bandwidth in excess of 500 kHz is described. Its settling time following changes in digital inputs of either polarity is less than 2 , μs. The dc resolution is 0.01 percent and the dynamic error increases from 0.01 percent at 50 kHz to 0.1 percent at 250 kHz."
"A permuter network is used to arbitrarily change the ordering of the variables of a switching function. A new scheme for permuter arrays is discussed in this note whereby the variables are selected sequentially by a number of \"selector cells\" according to the required output ordering. A cellular realization of the selector cell is suggested."
"In the search for new methods to realize stochastic automata, additive Bernoulli noise linear sequential circuits (ABNLSC) are constructed from linear sequential circuits fed with Bernoulli noise. The characteristics of the subclass of stochastic automata realizable by ABNLSC's are found. These characteristics include: commutativity with respect to input sequences; state minimality; doubly stochastic state transition matrices; and the conditions for the existence of asymptotic distribution of the state."
"The synthesis of sequential machines by interconnections of copies of a fixed module is considered. A family of modules Mr,pfor positive integers r and p, is defined. Mr,p can be used to synthesize sequential machines with 2Pinput symbols. A nondeterministic sequential machine (NSM) is said to be r-bounded if it has one initial state and for no state and input are there more than r choices for the next state. It is shown that the problem of finding a network of modules Mr,prealizing a given event E is equivalent to finding an r-bounded NSM realizing the reverse of E. As a consequence, two upper bounds on the number of copies of the module Mr,pnecessary to realize an event E can be shown. 1) If E is defined by an n-state NSM, then E is defined by a network of at most cln2+plogr2copies of Mr,p. 2) If E is defined by an n-state deterministic sequential machine, then E is defined by a network of at most c2nl+vlogr2copies of Mr,p. cland C2are constants, about 4."
"Several analytic procedures exist for transforming a partially symmetric switching function to a totally symmetric switching function by judiciously repeating certain variables. Presumably the best totally symmetric representation for a given function would be the one having the fewest variables. This note presents an iterative technique for finding the totally symmetric realization for a given function that has the absolute minimum number of variables."

"Practitioners of computer-aided network analysis are divided into two groups. One group seeks the most effective application of packaged programs to problem solution while the other group is chiefly interested in the algorithms that underlie these programs or that can provide the basis for the creation of new programs."
"Introductory literature on computers has, in recent years, grown rather voluminous. What Desmonde has provided, for a student, is a somewhat easy to read introductory glance at some of the essentials of computer characteristics and their uses. I am dubious of the value of this book to anyone already familiar with computers. However, this book offers the uninitiated some basic understandings of computers together with insights into their social value and impact. The book paints the computer in various lights. It touches on some areas of current social concern surrounding computer usage as well as a few of its societal advantages."
"J. Martin has succeeded in writing an eminently readable book about telecommunications that is refreshingly different from the usually stuffy textbooks full of technical jargon. Future Developments in Telecommunications is provocative, informative, and will be enjoyed equally by laymen with a passing interest in telecommunications, sociologists who are looking for thought-provoking notions of the effect of future communications on society, businessmen whose future life blood will be at the mercy of telecommunications, and the \"experts\" in the field of telecommunications, namely the computer users and the communications systems analysts. It is remarkable indeed that a book can be written that would have such a wide audience without becoming trivial to persons actively engaged in the development and operation of telecommunications systems. However, J. Martin has succeeded in one of his aims by demonstrating to nontechnical and technical audiences alike, the catalytic effect that communications presently have on the development of society and how this effect is likely to be magnified in the future, even–to the extent of affecting world prosperity and political systems. He raises many interesting and thought-provoking questions on the social challenges we will have to overcome as telecommunications grinds inexorably forward affecting more and more of the lives of each of us."
"The author has two general objectives for his text: 1) to provide a general orientation to the stored program computer; and 2) to provide insight into the broad impact of computers on management and the managerial environment.

"Suppose a set of N records must be read or written from a drum, fixed-head disk, or similar storage unit of a computer system. The records vary in length and are arbitrarily located on the surface of the drum. The problem considered here is to find an algorithm that schedules the processing of these records with the minimal total amount of rotational latency (access time), taking into account the current position of the drum. This problem is a special case of the traveling salesman problem. The algorithm that is developed has the attractive property of exhibiting a computational complexity on the order of N log N."
"A transcoder of logarithmic digital information into linear digital information is described. The circuit is simple and accurate. It can be easily integrated and used in any digital-to-analog or analog-to-digital converter with a logarithmic response."
"Some basic ideas and practices in the area of microdiagnostics are surveyed, and these are molded into a theoretical framework that could help the design of microprogrammed computers, as well as the development of test procedures for fault detection and location. The basic architectural variations as seen in the current microprogrammed computers and their relationship to microdiagnostics are discussed."
"Desirable properties of \"easily testable networks\" are given. A realization for arbitrary logic function, using AND and EXCLUSIVE-OR gates, based on Reed-Muller canonic expansion is given that has many of these desirable properties. If only permanent stuck-at-0 (s-a-0) or stuck-at-1 (s-a-1) faults occur in a single AND gate or only a single EXCLUSIVE-OR gate is faulty, the following results are derived on fault detecting test sets for the proposed networks: 1) only (n/4) tests, independent of the function being realized, are required if the primary inputs are fault-free; 2) only 2n, additional inputs (which depend on the function realized) are required if the primary inputs can be faulty, where n, is the number of variables appearing in even number of product terms in the Reed-Muller canonical expansion of the function; and 3) the additional 2ne inputs are not required if the network is provided with an observable point at the output of an extra AND gate."
"Let S be a sequential machine with binary (i. e., 0 or 1) input and binary output. Suppose that the third value N, different from 0 and 1, represents the faulty input or output value. An N-fail-safe (NFS) machine S̄ of S is then defined as a sequential machine with ternary (i.e., 0, 1, or N) input and ternary output such that: 1) S is a submachine of S̄, and 2) possible output failures of S̄ are 0→N or 1→ N for any input failures 0→N or 1→N. This machine may be considered \"fail-safe\" since no failure such as 0→1 or 1→0 occurs in the output."
"Various information-processing capabilities of self-organizing nets of threshold elements are studied. A self-organizing net, learning from patterns or pattern sequences given from outside as stimuli, \"remembers\" some of them as stable equilibrium states or state-transition sequences of the net. A condition where many patterns and pattern sequences are remembered in a net at the same time is shown. The stability degree of their remembrance and recalling under noise disturbances is investigated theoretically. For this purpose, the stability of state transition in an autonomous logical net of threshold elements is studied by the use of characteristics of threshold elements."
"In this paper the problem of numerical encoding of pictures consisting of regions of differing contrast is discussed. For this purpose we define the containment code, a special case of the more general property code presented in [1]. The containment code leads in a natural way to procedures for following the boundaries of the regions of the picture. This permits a compression of data into a linear array that can be stored for later processing or for picture reconstruction. The boundary following algorithms presented lend themselves well to hardware implementation as can be seen from an explicit sequential machine description. Related codes such as the boundary index code and the directional code are obtained from the containment code. Procedures are described for extracting various topological features such as curve length, chord length, area, and moments."
"The error equation for an approximate derivative computation scheme predicts convergence of a minimum area criterion for the identification of nonmemory-type nonlinearities and nonconvergence for memory-type nonlinearties. Determination of the system order and gain parameters is possible. Typical experimental results are given."
"This note considers the problem of minimizing the computation time required for digital filtering of pictures by the technique of sectioning. Direct enumeration on a computer was used to tabulate the optimum section size, and tables of the optimum section sizes are presented. The tables are compared with previously tabulated optimum sections for one-dimensional filtering; the optimal two-dimensional section sizes have linear dimensions twice as great as the optimal one-dimensional sections. To explain this discrepancy, analytical models are developed for the optimum one-and two-dimensional sections. The analytical models verify the tabulated data on optimum section size, and demonstrate why optimal two-dimensional sections are greater in size than corresponding one-dimensional sections."
"The problem of parameter optimization for the purpose of synthesis and design of feedback control systems is considered. A flexible performance index, which permits direct consideration of performance specifications such as rise time, settling time, peak overshoot, and bandwidth, in addition to the usual analytic forms, is developed and adapted to a modified version of Rosenbrock's pattern -search algorithm. Modifications of Rosenbrock's method include: 1) scaling of parameters to ensure coordinate orthogonalization; and 2) employing variable step sizes at the beginning of each new stage, the steps being a function of previous failures and successes. The efficiency of each stage is thus improved and the sensitivity to initial estimates of step size is reduced."
"Most wire-routing programs utilize a maze-running technique to route one connection at a time. Once routed, a wire cannot be moved even if it is subsequently discovered to interfere with the successful completion of other connections. The order in which the desired connections are presented to the routing algorithm has therefore been thought to be of critical importance. Experimental evidence is presented, however, to show that the performance of a router, when measured in terms of the total of the minimum (or ideal) lengths of the connections successfully completed, is, in fact, independent of the order in which connections are attempted."
"We describe a parallel mechanism, based on an array of circularly nutating photodetectors, that computes an approximation of the density of slopes of the boundary of any piecewise regular silhouette. This density, when properly normalized, is invariant with respect to the size, translation, and orientation of the given silhouette."
"This note describes an iterative procedure for generating the prime implicants of switching functions by utilizing a new tabular mode of functional representation called clause-column table. The procedure generates all the prime implicants and can be applied equally well to functions given in the sum-of-products or in the product-of-sums froms, both canonical and noncanonical. The procedure can also be readily adapted to determine the prime implicants of functions having a large number of unspecified or DON'T CARE terms."
"In the nonbinary case, the upper bound on the number of states of the one-channel analog for a k-channel finite-state machine is lower than that given by Gill.1"
"In the June 1972 issue of this TRANSACTIONS an inadvertant transposition occurred among the photographs and biographies of three authors.

"I. Flores has written a number of books on computers encompassing a broad spectrum of topics from logical design and system architecture to software and programming. This book on data structure and management examines the subject of data management in computer systems and gives a comprehensive treatment of the many facets of data; their encoding schemes, their representations in computer storage, the access and maintenance techniques for data structures and the related system-control operations to carry out data access and maintenance. The book starts from the fundamentals of data and data structures and places special emphasis on the reality of business data processing. The basic notions are then developed into thorough treatment of data management functions in both hardware and software, primarily in the context of IBM/ 360 type of systems. Despite the complexity of the subject matter, the material in the book is organized in a reasonably simplified manner to facilitate comprehension. The book can be used by students who major in computer systems and is also a good reference for practitioners in the data processing profession. For those readers who are information specialists but not involved in programming or managing computer systems, the book is a valuable text to gain understanding of the problems of data management."
"As the author states in the Preface, this book \"is to serve the needs of new students in the computer sciences, whether in college, junior college, technical institute, or high school.\" Since many books already exist to serve these needs, the very obvious question of what is the rationale for writing still another book must be answered. The author, in anticipating this question, puts forth the following rationale in the Preface."
"This book is intended to serve as an intermediate text for students who have already completed a basic course in computer design. Furthermore, it is aimed at engineers and potential computer systems designers rather than at programmers or business data-processing specialists. It is the author's hope that the book could be used as a text for a second semester course in computers, as well as being of interest to the practicing computer engineer. Unfortunately, I am somewhat disappointed in the book for a number of reasons."
"The English translation of the book by the well-known specialist Prof. Ya. Z. Tsypkin is a welcome addition to the currently available books on adaptive and learning systems. During the past decade there has been enormous research activity in these areas, and the author is directly responsible for the development of a number of pertinent topics. The manner of presentation and the range of subjects covered at a reasonable level of mathematics make the book very readable. This book undoubtedly will be of great interest to control engineers, reliability and operations research engineers, and computer scientists."

"A transform analogous to the discrete Fourier transform is defined in the ring of integers with a multiplication and addition modulo a Mersenne number. The arithmetic necessary to perform the transform requires only additions and circular shifts of the bits in a word. The inverse transform is similar. It is shown that the product of the transforms of two sequences is congruent to the transform of their circular convolution. Therefore, a method of computing circular convolutions without quantization error and with only very few multiplications is revealed."
"Many applications of Walsh functions employ Walsh series expansions. To obtain the advantage of data compression many of the Walsh coefficients must be negligible. It is thus desirable to have a scheme by which their magnitudes can be estimated with little computation. We found that the Walsh transform Fi of a function that can be differentiated by an arbitrary number of times is expressible as a weighted average of one of its derivatives. The mean and maximum of the weighting function is readily expressed in terms of i, from which we derived two upper bounds on Fi depending only on i and the maximum or mean magnitude of the derivative. As the bounds decrease rapidly with increasing degree and rank, Walsh transforms with high degree and rank are negligible. We also proved that discrete Walsh transforms calculated using sampled values obey the same bounds. While bounds can also be found for transforms of functions that can be differentiated by only a finite number of times, they tend to be larger and less dependent on rank. As most autocorrelation functions have singularities in second derivative, bounds on Walsh power spectra depend only on degree. Computed examples show that the behavior of Walsh spectra closely follow that of their upper bounds."
"This paper considers translation problems in residue number systems. The conversion from a fixed-base representation to a residue representation can be done using residue adders only; we show that relatively simple combinational logic can be used to replace one level of residue addition. In the reverse translation problem, we examine the conditions under which base extension can be used to compute the fixed-base digits from a residue code number, and we study the efficiency of the algorithm."
"In the present paper three theorems are developed to merge two columns in a cutpoint cellular array into one, depending on the sequence of cutpoint indices in each of the columns. An algorithm is then proposed for realizing arbitrary switching functions with a cutpoint cellular array, based on a set of rules derived from the above theorems. The algorithm is tested with numerous examples."
"This paper is concerned with the problem of analyzing ordinary Fortran-like programs to determine how many of their operations could be performed simultaneously. Algorithms are presented for handling arithmetic assignment statements, DO loops and IF statement trees. The height of the parse trees of arithmetic expressions is reduced by distribution of multiplication over addition as well as the use of associativity and commutativity. DO loops are analyzed in terms of their index sets and subscript forms. Some general underlying assumptions about machine organization are also given. In terms of several measures which are defined, the results of experimental analyses are presented. About 20 Fortran IV programs consisting of nearly 1000 source cards were analyzed. Evidence is given that for very simple Fortran programs 16 processors could be effectively used operating simultaneously in a parallel or pipeline fashion. Thus, for medium or large size Fortran programs, machines consisting of multiples of a basic 16 processor unit could be used."
"The overhead involved in the real-time multiprocessor execution of parallel-processable segments of a sequential program is investigated. The execution follows a preprocessing phase in which the source program is analyzed and the parallel-processable segments are recognized. A number of representations of a parallel-processable program are possible. A table representation is used, and a technique is developed to efficiently interpret this table in a system in which a number of identical processors share a common memory."
"The error-correcting codes for symbols from GF (2b) are often used for correction of byte-errors in binary data. In these byte-error-correcting codes each check symbol in GF (2b) is expressed as b binary check digits and each information symbol in GF (2b), likewise, is expressed by b binary information digits. A new class of codes for single-byte-error correction is presented. The code is general in that the code structure does not depend on symbols from GF (2b). In particular, the number of check bits are not restricted to the multiples of b as in the case of the codes derived from GF (2b) codes. The new codes are either perfect or maximal and are easily implementable using shift registers."
"A new error-control technique for logic processors is given. The proposed technique uses Reed-Muller codes (RMC's). The design scheme given has better efficiency than the schemes proposed earlier. The improved efficiency is obtained by relaxing a basic assumption originally made by Elias. Furthermore, it is shown that the efficiency of the proposed scheme asymptotically approaches the maximum efficiency achievable by a practical though restricted class of error-control schemes. Reliability of the proposed scheme is studied."
"A nonparametric classification procedure based on distribution-free tolerance regions is presented. Without knlowledge of the class probability distributions, the procedure gives information about the expected performance of the classifier through use of only one sample of statistically independent observations from each class. With this procedure, a two-class discriminant can be designed for a given expected false alarm probability or for a given confidence that the false alarm probability is less than a given amount. Three ordering methods are presented that appear intuitively reasonable for minimizing the miss probability. Even though the methods do not, in general, meet this objective, they are easily implemented on a computer and can give good results. A procedure for obtaining a measure of the miss probability is also presented. These methods are applied to the problem of verifying the purported identity of a speaker from a sample of the speaker's voice."
"This paper proposes a novel design for a parallel nonadaptive binary pattern classifier. The structure employs random-pulse (stochastic) computing elements to economically realize multimodal nonlinear discriminant functions similar in form to those used in potential function classifiers. The technique achieves efficient hardware utilization by employing a READ-ONLY memory (ROM) without addressing circuits to store modes and simultaneously execute parallel stochastic multiplications required in discriminant function computations."
"A theory for describing and measuring the concavities of cellular complexes (digitized silhouettes) is developed. This theory involves the use of the minimum-perimeter polygon and its convex hull."
"The problem of encoding the internal states of synchronous sequential switching circuits so as to minimize the combinational network cost is treated. Cost is defined as the number of AND-OR inputs required in the two-level implementation of each memory element input equation separately ( i.e., the cost is not reduced initially by the existence of common terms between equations). An algorithm has been developed that considers implicitly all distinct state-assignment schemes for a given state table, thus ensuring that the state assignment that results in the least \"cost\" combinational network is selected. Since any optimum state-assignment scheme is dependent on the type of memory element, the algorithm is designed for use with J-K flip-flop memory elements because of their wide use and versatility."
"An algorithm is described which generates the set of representative functions of the negation and/or permutation of variables and negation of the function (NPN) equivalence classes of unate Boolean functions. The algorithm is based upon integer programming techniques. The set of representative functions for the NPN equivalence classes of unate functions of six or fewer variables was obtained using this algorithm. The set of pseudothreshold functions of six or fewer variables was also tabulated by using this algorithm as a basis."
"A troublesome error has been found in digital data which represents an image renormalized by a computer. The error, which takes the form of anomalous patterns in the switching sequence of certain bits, contributes unnecessary, signal-dependent noise to the-data. Experimental results illustrating this phenomenon are shown and a theoretical model is derived. The model shows that the phenomenon results from a qtiantization or roundoff error inherent in digital renormalization and describes its detailed behavior. A method for rescaling the data which does not lead to the introduction of noise is described."
"Assumptions for the problem of postcorrection in nonrestoring division, as treated in a previous note by Rhyne, are reviewed. A specific type of quotient and remainder with the so-called concatenation property is then defined for. signed operands. A criterion is also given, extending the one given by Rhyne, to determine postcorrections applicable to quotient and remainder resulting from nonrestoring division, so as to obtain the concatenation property, and is applied to a specific example."
"General methods are presented for analyzing the terminal behavior of the classes of one-dimensional unidirectional iterative systems with arbitrary many intercell leads and two-dimensional iterative systems with unidirectional signal flow and one intercell lead on each axis, where the cell structure is either an arbitrary linear switching circuit (combinational) or an arbitrary linear sequential machine (LSM)."
"A method of synthesizing sequential machines using identical cells arranged in arrays is described. The array is connected in a regular pattern and can be designed to include features such as redundancy and programmability. Minimal synthesis is also discussed."
"This note reports the results of an examination of seven programs originally written for execution on a conventional computer (CDC-3600). We postulate an infinite machine, one with an infinite memory and instruction stack, infinite registers and memory, and an infinite number of functional units. This machine wiU exectite a program in parallel at maximum speed by executing each instruction at the earliest possible moment."
"This note investigates the increase in parallel execution rate as a function of the size of an instruction dispatch stack with lookahead hardware. Under the constraint that instructions are not dispatched until all preceding conditional branches are resolved, stack sizes as small as 2 or 4 achieve most of the parallelism that a hypothetically infinite stack would."
"After an analysis of the errors introduced in the approximate computation of the x2function (O ≤ x ≤ 1) and its distributions, we find that a parabolic rather than linear fit to log2 (1 + x), (O ≤ x ≤ 1) can be performed in hardware without increasing the number of necessary sums. An improvement, by a factor of about 2.5, in the absolute maximum error can be expected. Full simulation on a digital computer confirms the theoretical analysis. We used partitioning of the range in only two subranges; the resulting hardware is not harder than in piecewise linear approximation. Examples are also included to show the effectiveness of the method for approximation of different functions."
"A technique to design fault-locatable combinational switching circuits is given. The networks resulting from the application of the proposed technique have at most three levels of gates."
"A high-speed, self-checking count circuit realization is attainable by using combinational logic and parity prediction. The utilization of combinational logic as opposed to sequential logic design generally minimizes the amount of software necessary for routine and diagnostic testing. Count circuits with parity prediction find application in stand-alone, self-checking processors."
"A computer program has been written which is capable of evaluating all possible Golay marking transformations related to a particular pattern recognition task using an exhaustive search technique. Such evaluations are reported for separating two image data sets: one taken from biomedical microscopy; the other, aerial reconnaissance."
"In this paper, a multistage linear programming method of pattern recognition is proposed. The usual n-dimensional linear program has been split up into n stages of a one-dimensional linear program in such a way that more and more patterns belonging to two classes A and B are correctly classified as we proceed to higher and higher stages. It has been shown that if the threshold is kept fixed for ali the stages, the formulation of the problem entails a preprocessing of the feature coordinates; on the other hand, if the threshold is allowed to be different values in different stages, no such preprocessing is required. The application of the proposed method for the recognition of two handwritten Bengali characters has been discussed and compared with the results of other methods."
"A procedure is presented for simplifying the flow table of a sequential machine M when, in addition to the given flow table, it is specified that certain input sequences cannot occur. It is assumed that M receives its input from the output of another machine M, and that the restricted sequences are therefore those sequences that M, cannot generate."
"Critical race-free internal-state assignments can be found by several methods. Often these methods produce several assignments for the same flow table. New and improved tests are presented that can be used to select that assignment which is most likely to produce a set of simple design equations. These tests are applicable to the next-state equations as well as the output equations. The tests are applicable to circuits that are to be realized with NAND gates or set-reset (SR) flip-flops. Another advantage of these tests is that they allow comparison between state assignments with differing numbers of internal-state variables."
"A complete or restricted set of prime implicants (PI's) can cover the terms of the switching function with more or less redundancy. In order to find an irredundant form from the set of PI's, it is necessary to choose those PI's which contribute most effectively towards the strict minimum sum. The criterion for the right choice of the PI's is their weight from the point of view of their cost and their ability to cover a maximum number of switching terms. This criterion assures the simplicity of the switching circuit and helps to increase its reliability. The PI's with the highest weight are chosen."
"A general expression for oo such that cal (k,θ+θ0)= sal (k,θ) is obtained and a proof is given. This new form of θ0 is more direct and thus easier to use than other existing formulas."

"Goal and Result: The author states that the aim of this book is \"1) to present an introduction to computers and programming using the System/370 as the primary vehicle; and 2) to present an introduction o the System/370 for people experienced in computer science. I have found that this book contains a lot of useful information and, in fact, I can say that I learned quite a bit from the book. However, this does not mean that the author has met his goals. As for the beginner, hewould not come out with a thorough understanding of S/370 or computers in general because so little space was devoted to his initiation. The intermediate or advanced computer scientist would learn much about S/370 but I am afraid he would be left with many questions about the beast, just as I was."

"In high-speed multipliers, multiplication is activated by processing a group of bits in parallel. As a result, any defects in circuitry produce possible errors in positions that are separated by fixed periods. A class of codes for the correction of such iterative error patterns resulting from a single fault is presented in this paper. A decoding algorithm together with a simple implementation scheme is also discussed."
"The computational work of a process is measured in terms of the information in a memory for its table-lookup implementation. This measure is applied first to simple logical and arithmetic processes, and then more complicated processes comprising organizations (called synergisms) of several subprocesses. The computational advantages of Cartesian, compositional, and sequential synergisms are investigated and illustrated by means of the work measure. The relation between the work of a process and the work capacity of a facility on which it is implemented is examined, and a concept of efficiency of implementations is formulated. A few areas for further investigation are outlined."
"An aerospace guidance computer organization, consisting of multiple processors and memory units attached to a central time-multiplexed data bus, is described. A job mix for this type of computer is obtained by analysis of Apollo mission programs. Multiprocessor performance is then analyzed using: 1) queuing theory, under certain \"limiting case\" assumptions; 2) Markov process methods; and 3) system simulation. Results of the analyses indicate: 1) Markov process analysis is a useful and efficient predictor of simulation results; 2) efficient job execution is not seriously impaired even when the system is so overloaded that new jobs are inordinately delayed in starting; 3) job scheduling is significant in determining system performance; and 4) a system having many slow processors may or may not perform better than a system of equal power having few fast processors, but will not perform significantly worse."
"The uniform loading theory [1] has been approximated and used to analyze a class of interconnection problems usually encountered in the design of high-speed circuit packaging and memory arrays in today's computers. The uniform loads are, for example, IC gates and via holes on multilayered printed circuit board and cross-coupling capacitance in memory arrays. They are treated as discrete loads along smooth transmission lines. The input and output transfer function, impulse response, unit step response, and propagation delay are calculated. To a first-order approximation, the pure resistive loaded line impedance and voltage reflection coefficient can be easily derived. Matching conditions and some experimental results are included. Oscillation due to second-order effects is also discussed."
"A deductive method of fault simulation is described, which \"deduces\" the faults defected by a test at the same time that it simulates explicitly only the good behavior of logic circuit. For large logic circuits (at least several thousand gates) it is expected to be faster than \"parallel\" fault simulators, but uses much more computer memory than do parallel simulators."
"Two sequential permutation networks which generate all nǃ permutations without duplication are presented. Each permutation can be derived from its predecessor autonomously in one clock step. Based on the principle of recursive execution of a product of transpositions, the first network is constructed in multiple cascades of ½(n²-n) switching elements each of which permutes its input pair to its output pair according to its internal state, and is controlled sequentially by the same principle. Next, the network whose structure and control sequence are complementary to those of the first is presented. The first is named a cyclic permutation network and is an explicit representation of a mapping function The second is named a lexicographic permutation network and is an explicit representation of a factorial counting function where ah is a h-nary factorial digit 0 ≤ ah ≤ (n-1). The characteristics of the networks are investigated by establishing a one-to-one correspondence among nI integers, n! permutations, and n! states of the networks. For the lexicographic permutation network which can generate all permutations in lexicographic order, three examples of applications are given."
"The relationship between multivalued switching algebra and Boolean algebra is presented by introducing different definitions for the complements of multivalued variables. For every definition introduced, the paper points out which Boolean algebra theorems are valid for multivalued cases, which are invalid, and gives proofs to substantiate the claim. It is shown that DeMorgan's theorem holds for all four definitions of complement given in this paper. One definition allows us to map the multivalued variables into binary variables. Under this definition, all axioms and theorems of Boolean algebra are satisfied and can be used for minimization of any multivalued switching function f. Illustrative examples for minimizing f and its complement f are given."
"A selector function is defined as a choice function, which selects one particular argument in a set of arguments according to given selection criteria. A notation has been developed which states the algorithms that apply for symbolic treatment of the selector functions. Some examples of selector functions are given and the corresponding physical interpretations indicated."
"This note is largely a generalization of the Elspas-Stone theory about the realization of group functions from Xm into H. In the paper of Elspas-Stone only the case X = {0,1} was treated, whereas we consider an arbitrary finite set X. We have shown that the most important results of [1] hold for this general case."
"It is shown that if a machine M con be mapped into a simpler machine M' by a homomorphism, then an error correcting/detecting code can be applied to the states of M such that the parity check bits are generated independently of the information bits that form the state assignment of M. If such a homomorphism does not exist, it is shown how to produce one by altering M if M consists entirely of loops as is the case with a digital computer. The method presented here is a generalization to sequential machines of the separate adder and checker concept used for checking addition. Methods of coding are given. Application to computers is given."
"This note describes a set of register-transfer modules (RTM's) that are used as a basis for digital systems design. RTM's allow digital systems to be specified in a flow chart form with complete construction (wiring) information, thus obviating combinational and sequential switching circuit theory based design. The modules make extensive use of integrated circuitry. The note briefly describes the class of problems that RTM's can be used to solve, together with some of the module design decisions. The most important RTM's are described from the user's viewpoint, and two example designs are given."
"In this note a necessary and sufficient condition is supplied for a flow table to have the property that every cover composed of maximal compatibles is closed. An example of such a flow table is given to which all sufficient conditions known before do not apply."
"In this note a matrix method is given that enables one to determine all pairs of compatible states in the case of incompletely specified sequential automata."
"A simple algorithm for testing the 2-summability of Boolean functions is presented in this note. The concept of asummobility has been extended and the idea of \"mutual 2-asummability\" has been introduced. The authors show how mutual 2-asummobility can be utilized for the testing of isobaricity of threshold functions containing no more than seven variables."
"In this note, arbitrary switching function realizers and their complexity are defined. Then, a lower bound on the complexity is derived in terms of the number of such switching function realizers required to realize all Boolean functions of n variables."
"This correspondence shows that, contrary to a statement in the cited paper, fault location is sometimes possible in one-dimensional arrays in which only the outputs of the rightmost cell are observable."
"Several algorithms for the computation of the mean value of a random variable have been analyzed. Results have shown that the two previously published techniques and a modified version of one of these, give unbiased estimates of the mean value. Furthermore, although the confidence intervals have been found to be increased in all cases, the actual increase is insignificant, while the possible speed improvements in computation can be considerable."
"In the above note,1a method is presented for forming a Walsh function, wal(n,θ), where n is the order and θ is the normalized time. A binary representation of n is converted to a Gray code, after which the Rademacher functions corresponding to the ONE bits in the Gray code are multiplied to synthesize a Walsh function. A simple extension of this method allows evaluation of any arbitrary point on the nth Walsh function without listing tables of Rademacher functions R(m,θ)."
"Properties and construction of a class of test matrices, called \" simply invertible matrices,\" are given."
"The algorithm of division based on multiplication is well known [1]-[5]. It permits utilization of fast multiply hardware in the implementation of division. The algorithm defines an iterative process in which numerator and denominator are both multiplied by the same factor misuch that the denominator converges to 1 and the numerator to the quotient. Convergence can be speeded up by finding a good value for m0, the first multiplier, by means of table lookup. The first two bits of the denominator D are 0.1 (assuming a normalized denominator). The next n bits are used to enter the table, yielding m0and D1=m0*D, where D1has a bits of convergence and as shown in [6]."

"This book provides an excellent method to learn about compilers. At an introductory, intermediate, and advanced level, it discusses topics central and related to the construction of compilers, many of which have previously appeared only in journal articles or publications not generally available. The work has only two faults. It was composed on an IBM 360 line printer using FORMAT and thus suffers typographically. It is not a cookbook for advanced compiler implementation. That is, when one attempts to build an advanced compiler with optimization, and when he attempts to find the answer to his pressing practical problems in the book, the answers may well not be there. In fairness, however, the book provides excellent indices and a very good historical and general bibliography that might aid the serious implementer."
"It is unusual these days to find a product that does more than expected. Mr. Groner's book not only covers an appropriate subset of the PL/I language, but also imparts much wisdom from the field of scientific computing. It does much to bridge the wide gap between the functional understanding of a computer language and the skill necessary to effectively use it in solving problems. The reader is assumed to be knowledgeable in engineering or the sciencies, but a beginner to computer programming."
"The authors have written an introductory textbook on switching algebra and its application to logic system design. The book contains almost no formal mathematical presentation and, hence, is quite easy to read. The level of the presentation could easily be handled by third-year undergraduate students. (The authors state that the material is suitable for approximately a one-semester course, but do not specify an intended level.) No background in switching algebra is assumed or required. At various points throughout the textbook, some of the practical aspects of logic system design are mentioned and the impractical aspects of the material are pointed out where appropriate. The method of presentation and the orientation will appeal to students with an engineering background, but students with a strong mathematical bent will not be as interested."

 "The classical signal processing technique known as Wiener filtering has been extended to the processing of one-and two-dimensional discrete data by digital operations with emphasis on reduction of the computational requirements. In the generalized Wiener filtering process a unitary transformation, such as the discrete Fourier, Hadamard, or Karhunen-Loéve transform is performed on the data that is assumed to be composed of additive signal and noise components. The transformed data is then modified by a filter function, and the inverse transformation is performed to obtain the discrete system output. The filter function is chosen to provide the best mean square estimate of the signal portion of the input data."
"Spatial frequency encoding is described as it applies to both photographic and television systems. In each case, color separations amplitude modulate spatial frequency carriers. The photographic system separates the carriers in the two-dimensional Fourier transform plane using coherent optics; the television system employs a two-dimensional electrical filter to perform the same separation. These filters are synthesized so that the two-dimensional bandwidths of the television camera are used efficiently. Nonlinear processing techniques are also described to minimize crosstalk between channels."
"Many seismic experiments result in multiple time series which can be decomposed into signal and additive noise, where the noise has both a coherent and an incoherent component. The signal and the two noise components are stationary second-order random functions. The time shifts, called moveouts, of the signal and coherent noise are random variables with known distributions. Wiener filter theory is used to design the filter system that gives the optimal signal estimate, based upon the moveout distributions and the power spectra of the various components of the data. Velocity filters are useful in seismic data processing to separate signal from noise on the basis of moveout (velocity) differences without distorting the basic shape of the signal."
"The problem of change detection presents itself for imaging systems that view the same scene repeatedly. Current research programs based on the processing of side-looking radar imagery show that spatial alignment of the various parts of the image must be highly accurate if noise in the difference picture is to be reduced to acceptably low levels. Typically, the spatial alignment accuracy must be better than one-fourth of the diameter of the smallest resolvable feature in the imagery, and this often requires several hundred degrees of freedom in the performance of the map warp for images that are of the order of 107picture cells (pixels) in size. Gray scale rectification of conjugate sampling points is less difficult, requiring typically only 10 to 20 percent as many degrees of freedom. Point by point adjustment for differences in mean transparency and contrast is employed. Recently developed equipment provides a continuous pipeline processing capability. With this equipment, each picture element of the second image is transformed with four degrees of freedom (two spatial and two gray scale). The digital correlator is capable of processing 4×105six-bit picture elements per second when used in conjunction with a CDC 1700 computer."
"A procedure is described for stochastic syntax analysis of context-free languages. The parsing algorithm utilizes a bottom-up technique used in precedence languages. All decisions encountered in the algorithm ate determined statistically. The stochastic choice is computed from the a priori probability distribution of the language. Also developed is a stochastic context-free language for use in pattern classification of chromosome images. Classification is based on statistical decision theory with the probability of occurrence of each pattern computed from the stochastic context-free grammar."
"The complete pattern recognition problem is considered for the practical solution to a current significant medical question. Automated screening of chest radiographs for the detection of textural type abnormalities is approached from the view of: 1) preprocessing for standardization and data reduction; 2) feature extraction of characteristic measures (feature selection by optimization of classification accuracy); and 3) overall classification using training and test sets of selected chest radiographs."
"Further work is described on simple sets of parallel operations that detect \"texture edges\" (abrupt discontinuities in the average values of local picture properties), as well as spots or streaks that are texturally different from their surrounds."
"The measurement of winds to an accuracy of at least 2 knots (1 m/s) is a major requirement of the global atmospheric research program (GARP) [1]. Such accurate wind measurements will be needed over large regions presently lacking ground or rawinsonde observations. A man-computer system called WINDCO has been developed to measure cloud motion from ATS pictures. This system is capable of providing cloud motion measurements that are repeatable to within 6 knots over two independent time intervals in the majority of cases."
"A problem that is common to all phases of seismic data processing is the lack of knowledge concerning the input or seismic source signal axnd the noise characteristics of the recorded waveforms from the seismic sensors."
"A system for simulating video bandwidth compression techniques is described. The simulation facility accepts up to 10 s of real-time video and slows the scan rate so that this information can be converted for storage and processing on a digital computer. The processed information is then converted back to real-time video for visual evaluation."
"Three methods approaching the analysis of cells are described, with applications. The methods presuppose that the picture of the cells has already been digitized and resides in the memory of a computer. The first method is an ad hoc approach in which intercommunicating programmable cursors are utilized for the detection of boundary and area features. The second method is concerned with an evaluation of the curvatures of boundary segments in relation to the overall shape of the boundary. The third method imbeds the picture in a non-Euclidean coordinate system, preserving as invariants salient features while negating the effect of nonsignificant distortions."
"A computer algorithm is described that extracts the edge information from a digital image of an AP radiograph of the knee. Automated image field partitioning is used as a simplifying first step in the process. Methods that employ a priori knowledge are used to insure simple connected edges."
"This note gives a brief overview of six types of pattern recognition programs that: 1) preprocess, then characterize; 2) preprocess and characterize together; 3) preprocess and characterize into a \"recognition cone;\" 4) describe as well as name; 5) compose interrelated descriptions; and 6) converse."
"Cloud photographs are available from geosynchronous weather satellites at intervals of approximately 20 min. Sequences of such photographs show cloud motions over vast regions of the planet, providing a potential source of useful weather data, particularly over the oceans, since there are few weather-monitoring stations at sea. Our computer programs represent objective methods that require a minimum of human assistance to compute cloud motions. Computer algorithms are described for matching the earth's disk, giving a global registration; a more precise local registration is then achieved by matching landmarks. Accurate registration is needed because the satellite cannot be given an ideal synchronous orbit and perfect attitude stability. We have experimented with landmark templates of sizes 10×10 and 20×20 picture elements, representing 25-mi and 50-mi squares. An initial coarse scan of the template suggests where to try a succession of fine scans. The disk matching and the template matching are combined in the complete subsystem for registration. Properly registered cloud data are processed by means of the ISODATA clustering algorithm, which represents a cloud pattern by a number of cluster centers. Cloud motions are found by tracking these centers on successive pictures."
"A handwritten character recognition system has been designed by making use of topological feature extraction and multilevel decision making. By properly specifying a set of easily detectable topological features, it is possible to convert automatically the handwritten characters into stylized forms and to classify them into primary classes with similar topological configurations. Final recognition is accomplished by a secondary stage that performs local analysis on the characters in each primary category. The recognition system consists of two stages: global recognition, followed by local recognition. Automatic character stylization results in pattern clustering which simplifies the classification tasks considerably, while allowing a high degree of generality in the acceptable writing format. Simulation of this scheme on a digital computer has shown only 6 percent misrecognition."
"An image classification model based on nearest prototypes in filtered Fourier and Walsh transform domains is presented. A computer simulation of the model applied to handwritten English letters, Russian letters, numerals, and electromagnetic signals is also presented. Experiments to date fail to refute the working hypothesis that generalized harmonic analysis can be used to reliably classify alphabet characters, time-varying signals, and other images."
"The problem of developing an appropriate data base for syntax-directed pattern analysis and recognition is considered. A new data base is introduced by generalizing the notion of concatenation in representing patterns with a relationship matrix. The characteristics of relationship matrix are demonstrated in teh context of formal language theory. It is shown that this data base will allow us to remove many of the present restrictions placed on the types of patterns that can be handled by syntax-directed systems. Problems in pattern analysis (description and generation) as well as in pattern recognition are discussed and examples are given to illustrate the potential application of this data base in both of these areas."
"A method is given for transposition of 2n×2n data matrices, larger than available high-speed storage. The data should be stored on an external storage device, allowing direct access. The performance of the algorithm depends on the size of the main storage, which at least should hold 2n+1 points. In that case the matrix has to be read in and written out n times."
"This correspondence is an informal exposition on a method of pattern recognition recently introduced by McCormick and Michalski. The method, described here by means of a simple example and a biological application, provides mechanized generation of an optimum set of \"intervals\" which can be interpreted as local position-invariant digital operations for use in picture filtering with a parallel array processor."
"With the availability of the computer for two-dimensional picture processing, digital restoration of deterministically degraded sampled images is a practical reality. This correspondence presents a mathematical formulation of discrete modulation transfer compensation of sampled imagery. The analysis makes no assumption regarding the band limitedness of the imaging system and accounts explicitly for the effects of spectrum foldover."

This standard applies to devices (other than surge arresters) used for the purpose of controlling the ground current or the potentials to ground of alternating current systems. It defines usual and unusual service conditions, and gives bases for rating such devices. Specifications are given for temperature limitations, dielectric tests, routine tests, losses and impedance measurements, and construction items."
"This standard provides a basis for showing the general physical location and arrangement of the sections of the required wiring system, and identifying the physical requirements for various types of materials needed to provide the electrical installation in buildings. The required installation is shown on the drawing by the use of the various applicable outlet and equipment symbols, together with interconnecting circuit or feeder run lines, supplemented with necessary notations. In general, basic symbols have been included in the symbol schedule. In some instances, the use of numbers or letters of the alphabet drawn, or at the side of, the basic symbol to identify a specific application of the symbol for a particular type of use of outlet may be required.

"Tests for measuring the pulse-height, spurious-pulse, and pulse-timing characteristics of photomultipliers used in scintillation and Cerenkov counters are presented. Five different measurement techniques are described. They are rise-time measurements, fall-time measurements, photocathode transit-time difference measurements, and transit-time spread measurements."
"The purpose of this standard is to document the minimum information that users of bolometric power meters may need. It also provides potential purchasers and others with a common means for making comparisons between instruments and provides a uniformity of information among manufacturers. This standard applies to bolometric power meters as complete instruments and to their constituent parts: bolometric detectors, bolometer units, and bolometer elements. Bolometer power measurement instrumentation is generally used to measure, below 100 mW and above 10 MHz, the average power of electromagnetic waves propagating in a single mode in waveguide or coaxial transmission lines. The power range can be extended by the use of attenuators or directional couplers, or both.<<ETX>>"

 "Airborne 2.25-cm wavelength radar backscatter measurements of low-wind-speed sea conditions were obtained off the coast of Texas in January 1971. These data are compared with unpublished NASA 2.25-cm backscatter measurements recorded over the Atlantic in 1970. The two data sets were in general agreement and supported results previously reported by other authors which showed the absence of a saturation effect at this wavelength. Analyses of these data using computerized clustering techniques indicated that a wind speed measurement accuracy of 5-7 knots is an operational potential."
"Optical techniques have opened up new possibilities in air pollution monitoring because of their remote-sensing capability, very high specificity, and short observation time. Techniques involving the use of lasers include Raman scattering, emission either from resonantly excited or from hot gases, and resonant absorption. Unique advantages in these applications are provided by the recently developed tunable lasers, including organic dye lasers, parametric oscillators, spin-flip Raman lasers, and semiconductor lasers. The absorption technique which promises to have the widest range of application has been tested in the laboratory by using tunable diode lasers. High-resolution absorption spectra have been measured for SF6, NH3, and C2H4 at 10.6 μm, SO2 at 8,6 μm, CO at 4.7 μm, and NO at 5.2 μm, and the C2H4 (ethylene) content of automobile exhausts has been measured by means of a derivative technique. A sensitivity sufficient to detect one ppm of NH3 in air has been achieved in a 10-μm-long gas cell. The 50 to 100-kHz resolution achievable with diode lasers is about four orders of magnitude better than the resolution of conventional spectrometers and more than adequate to resolve Doppler broadened gas absorption lines which are on the order of 100 MHz wide."
"One of the missions of the National Marine Water Quality Laboratory (NMWQL), situated on the shores of Narragansett Bay, is to use the bay as a laboratory to develop techniques for determining the state of the marine environment through continuous surveillance. Narragansett Bay is well suited for such an effort because of its close proximity to the urban center of Providence and to the laboratory and because it has all the factors typical of estuarine environments in the Northeast. In addition, the monitoring system is of value to the laboratory because it supports its other missions relative to developing water quality standards and techniques for determining urban industrial site locations. This paper deals with the design of such a system. The first step of this design procedure is the careful definition of the mission of the system. The second step is a complete description of the dynamic geophysical environment under consideration. Consideration is next given to the tradeoffs possible between a system which accomplishes its mission by making a very large number of observations and a system which accomplishes its mission by making a small number of observations but with a great deal of sophisticated data analysis to predict the actual environmental conditions between stations. An ideal combination of hardware and software yields the minimum cost system to accomplish the mission. Consideration has also been given in the design to instrumentation and concurrent research needed."
"In the study of wave generation by wind, an exploration of the wind (or pressure) field close to the water surface is critical. An electrohydraulic servomechanism, a \"wave follower,\" has been designed to hold a probe at small distances above the sea surface while following the surface. The follower, mounted underwater, senses the location of the water surface with a capacitance wave probe. A hydraulic system adjusts the position of the probe so as to seek a null. The follower's response to the surface extends to 4 Hz with good coherence, and it can follow fully developed water waves up to 30 cm in height. A hot-film anemometer probe senses the wind speed, while the wave probe records waves up to 12 Hz. The follower is remote controlled at distances up to 60 m. Two field trips were undertaken in 1969 at Miles River, Chesapeake Bay. Wind speed data were taken at 2 to 40 cm above the surface, with wind speeds of 5 to 15 knots and fetches of 1 to 6 nmi. The waves ranged approximately 10 to 30 cm in height. Preliminary investigation of the data shows, among other things, presence of the sheltering effect and a small but definite coherence between wind and waves at the wave peak frequency."
"Doppler return from the general case of a two-dimensional random rough surface is investigated. This is an extension of work recently reported for a special case of rough surface. Helmholtz integral approach is used, employing Kirchhoff's approximations in order to evaluate the integral for the plane-wave case. Two-dimensional transmitter/receiver gain function and reflection coefficients are used. The shape of the Doppler spectrum is at variance with those offered by the usual theories in that it is not centered at the mean Doppler frequency. Furthermore, a study of the spectrum shape shows a significant surface modulation effect, antenna gaim functions, and surface reflectivity parameters, in view of the fact that a designer needs to consider these effects. A Univac 1108 computer was used for numerical calculation, and the resulting data are plotted."
"The river and flood forecast and warning service of the National Weather Service depends on meteorological data and a vast hydrologic reporting network of nearly 5000 river and rainfall stations. Reports are collected daily or on a criteria basis during periods of heavy rainfall and/or high flow in the rivers. Less than 15 percent of the hydrologic network is telemetered. Although most of the observations are recorded automatically on site, an observer must telephone the report to a data collection center for relay to one of the twelve National Weather Service River Forecast Centers. In 1967-1969, an experiment in river and rainfall data collection via NASA's ATS-1 satellite was conducted. The technical and operational feasibility of data collection from remote sites via satellite was proved in the test. NASA will launch for NOAA in 1973 the first in a planned series of geostationary operational environmental satellites (GOES). In conjunction with this, a prototype network is scheduled for installation in the Columbia Basin of the Pacific northwest. This system could form the basis for a national data collection system to serve the nation's water resources users. During the next decade, it is anticipated that the hydrologic data collection network will double in order to satisfy river and flood forecast service needs placed upon the National Weather Service. GOES, with its continuous data collection and relay function, holds promise for providing a life-saving and economic space-age benefit."
"An optical Fourier transform analysis of a sea photograph taken under a particular skylight irradiance has been proposed by Stilwell [1] as a means of providing a quantitative description of the sea-vector wave-number spectrum. The process requires an explicit knowledge of the skylight irradiance reflected from the sea surface to the aerial camera. A first-order analysis shows that the photographic density of the transform recording is functionally related to the sea-slope spectrum, provided that the average optical density measured in the sea photographic negative is approximately linear. The analysis of the process and some experimental results are discussed."
"The history and theory of the acoustic radar are briefly reviewed. It is pointed out that scattering of sound by the atmosphere is produced by temperature and wind fluctuations, but that only temperature variations produce backscatter. Concepts for using the acoustic radar to measure profiles of temperature, wind, and humidity are discussed. A technique for measuring humidity profile using the relationship between attenuation of sound and absolute humidity is described. Design of the acoustic radar components is discussed with particular emphasis given to the problem of the antenna design. Some of the results of eight months of operation of the system are discussed. One case in which the acoustic radar was able to detect the passage of a thermal structure discontinuity not detectable by conventional observational and analysis techniques is described. It is concluded that the analog form of the data has great potential usefulness for continuously monitoring the thermal structure of the lower troposphere. Further measurement of wind and humidity profiles, and perhaps also the temperature profile to heights of a few thousand feet by means of the acoustic radar, seems feasible if the signal-to-noise ratio in the present system can be improved."
"A semiautomatic, self-leveling lunar gravimeter has been designed for the purpose of measuring gravity at predetermined stops along the route of a Lunar Rover Vehicle to obtain a gravity profile. The Traverse Gravimeter is completely self-contained and is powered by an internal battery. The gravity sensor is a vibrating string accelerometer (VSA) which is enclosed in a precision oven. Gravity data are obtained by initiating a measurement. After the gravimeter has leveled, the VSA difference frequency is counted down and a gate is generated to enable a crystal-controlled clock to a BCD counter. The BCD counter stores the data which are a measurement of gravity. These data, displayed upon command by the astronaut, are transmitted by voice back to earth. It is expected that the accuracy of the gravimeter will be in excess of 1 mgal. Low power, light weight, reliability, and simplicity of operation are major considerations in the design of the gravimeter."
"This paper presents a summary of the experimental objectives and spacecraft instrumentation associated with the S-193 altimeter experiment for the 1973 Skylab mission. The experiment is, in general terms, directed toward geodetic altimetry and the acquisition of technical information needed to improve future precision altimeter designs, remote sensing of oceanographic and surface features, and measurement of basic electromagnetic scattering characteristics. A detailed discussion of the experiments associated with these objectives is given and the paper concludes with a review of the spacecraft hardware characteristics."

"An alternative to the standard astrogeodetic and gravimetric methods for estimating vertical deflections is described. This technique, which is particularly well suited to surveys from moving vehicles, utilizes an inertial navigation system, a geodetic position and velocity reference, and an optimal data smoother. An inertial navigation system inherently indicates the astronomic vertical so that vertical deflections cause errors in indicated geodetic position and velocity. This error is measured using an external geodetic position reference (such as LORAN) and a velocity reference. These measurements are then processed by a smoother to recover the vertical deflections. The particular smoother used is the so-called Kalman smoother which treats all of the error sources including vertical deflections as random processes. Both analytic studies are performed and real data from midocean areas are processed. These studies show that if a high-quality inertial system is used in conjunction with a geodetic position reference of accuracy 0.1 nmi rms, vertical deflections of magnitude 10-30 rms can be estimated to within 5-8 rms."

"VLF and LF electromagnetic (EM) ground-wave propagation between points on the surface of a smooth lunar sphere which is surrounded by free space or a cold isotropic plasma is investigated. Following Ward's analysis of recent lunar geophysical data, two mathematical models which are most likely to actually exist were chosen as either a cold homogeneous moon or a hot wet moon. The hot wet model is conceived as a radial stratification of material consisting of a dry outer shell, a wet shell, and a hot interior. Further subdivision results when the uppermost part of the wet shell is assumed to be either frozen (permafrost model) or unfrozen (wet rock model). The conductivities and dielectric constants in the hot wet model were assumed to vary continuously at several different rates within each of the layers, finally attaining the values suggested by Ward. Using the permafrost and wet rock models, the range of variation of the surface impedance and the subsequent variations in the ground-wave attenuation function were calculated versus frequency in the VLF and LF bands on the moon's dark side, and for frequencies above the solar-wind plasma frequency on its sunlit side. It is concluded that conditions for long-distance point-to-point ground-wave propagation are considerably better for the permafrost model. Above 100 kHz there is little difference between any of the assumed models, and the effect of the deeper subsurface stratification becomes second order."
"The standard deviation of scatterometer measurements has been derived under assumptions applicable to spaceborne scatterometers. Numerical results are presented which show that, with sufficiently long integration times, input signal-to-noise ratios below unity do not cause excessive degradation of measurement accuracy. The effects on measurement accuracy due to varying integration times and changing the ratio of signal bandwidth to IF filternoise bandwidth are also plotted. The results of the analysis may resolve a controversy by showing that in fact statistically useful scatterometer measurements can be made from space using a 20-W transmitter, such as will be used on the S-193 experiment for Skylab-A."
"Design of a portable data logging instrumentation is discussed. The equipment provides magnetic tape recording of atmospheric noise waveshapes, suitable for computer processing or for use in system simulation. Noise distributions and typical pulse shapes are presented for field data. The possibility of obtaining a significant noise-variance reduction is shown by using the data as excitation to a simple computer simulation."
"Methods capable of detecting oil present as a pollutant in waste water were selected which are capable of measuring quantities of oil from as small as those in a surface active film to massive accumulations. Detection techniques for both thick and thin oil deposits were studied, and systems incorporating the most promising ones were developed and tested. It was found that more techniques can be adapted to the thick oil than to the thin oil detection problem because thick oil can be measured by electrical- and thermal-conductivity devices that require little maintenance in sewer use, whereas detectors of small amounts are somewhat less suited to the sewer environment. The most promising techniques developed used RF and heat-conductivity sensors for the detection of massive oil accumulations from a few millimeters to several meters thick and used ultraviolet transmission sensors for the detection of dispersed oil over the range of 5 to 10 000 parts per million. The resulting instrumentation was tested in a sewer environment and found to be capable of unattended operation for periods ranging from a week to several months. The instrumentation was combined with telemetry to permit readout at a remote central location."

 "A simple modification of conventional intensity recorders substantially increased their inherently low dynamic range at a slight sacrifice of S/N processing gain. The implemented modification consisted of a square wave modulation of the gain of the recorder amplifier. It was tested on two standard intensity recorders with satisfactory results presented here. Some theoretical aspects are discussed in the Appendix."
"Echo counting and echo integration are two acoustic techniques for estimating the abundance of fish stocks. Mathematical models for the echo counting and echo integrating systems are presented and analyzed. Expressions for the mean squared errors of the abundance estimate obtained with each system are obtained. Both theoretical performance and the practical problems of implementation are considered in the discussion of the relative advantages and disadvantages of each system."
"The problem undertaken was to devise a remote sensing technique to measure the salinity of brackish water emerging from submarine springs and floating on coastal sea water. In the range of interest, 20° to 25° C, 0,3 ppt to 30 ppt dissolved solids, the dominant physical factor explaining the change of reflectance with salinity changes is the ionic conductivity due to the lateral flow of ions induced by the imposed electromagnetic field. The ionic conductivity of brackish water is a monotonic function of the salt content. A laboratory prototype radio reflection spectrometer was designed and assembled from commercially available swept-frequency UHF-microwave test equipment, a single horn antenna, and a handmade coaxial sample cell. Reflectance spectra from 2.5 X 109 to 4.0 × 109 Hertz of fresh and sea water were obtained with a free-wave (horn antenna and pool) system. Reflectance spec tra of brackish and sea water from 108 to 2.0 × 109 Hertz were obtained with a coax ial waveguide system. The measured spectral signatures appear to agree with the computed reflectance of aqueous sodium chloride solutions. The theoretical and experimental results indicate that free-wave radio reflectance spectrometry from 108 to 109 Hz may be feasible for use in remote sensing of large salinity anomalies on relatively smooth water bodies."

 "Multivariate normal probability density functions are usually used in classification decision (i.e., recognition) processes on multispectral scanner data. The mean and covariance matrix of the normal density function are usually estimated from a training data set. In this study, a comparison was made to determine whether or not improved classification results could be obtained by use of a different form to represent the probability density functions, namely, an empirical multivariate probability density histogram of decorrelated variables. First, tests were made of the normality of the individual subsets of data, and all were found to be non-normal at the 1% level of significance using a standard chi-square goodness-of-fit test. Operating characteristic curves then were generated to represent decisions made with each form between each given class and a uniformly distributed alternative class; a uniform distribution was chosen because the results are then least dependent on the choice of the alternative data set. It was found that the probabilities of misclassification using the two forms were approximately identical for almost every data set even though a large number of individual data points were classified differently. It was concluded that a decision rule based on the assumption of multivariate normal distributions of scanner signals performs sufficiently well, in comparison with a more accurate but more complicated rule, to warrant its continued use in recognition processing."
"A description of a three dimensional ray-tracing program for atmospheric acoustic waves is presented. The method uses Haselgrove's equations implemented on a hybrid computer. The program is able to obtain ray-paths for these waves in complex atmospheric models which are both anisotropic and nonhomogeneous. The approach has the advantages of simplicity, low cost, an accuracy more than sufficient for available atmospheric models and an interactive capability whereby results are available at once and may thus be used to select parameters for succeeding runs. Sample results are also given."

"In 1965 P. Wolf of the Institute fur Rundfunktechnik, Munich, Germany, made a significant contribution to the measurement of encoded color television signals with his introduction of the 20T modulated sine-squared pulse. It possesses the ability to measure relative chrominance gain and delay, or color misregistry. This signal enjoys widespread operational use abroad. Interest in a modulated sine-squared test signal for NTSC is at present quite significant. A properly scaled test signal for NTSC is presented. The proposed signal is properly called 12.5T modulated sine-squared pulse. Compared to a 20 T, it offers: 1) an increased sensitivity to relative chroma delay, and 2) a simple scale factor for 12.5T; τ= 10d, and for 20T; τ=15.9d. Nomographs are provided for both the 20T and 12.5T modulated sine-squared pulses for NTSC. Mathematical derivation for the waveform distortion as a function of delay distortion is given in terms of the significant pulse parameter."
"The TV transmission system should be as nearly transparent as possible. The continued improvement in color equipment has made it important that deficiencies in the transmission system be minimized. By observing the waveform distortion, phase and amplitude errors can be examined and relatively simple corrections can be applied. Time domain equalizers can enhance the corrections and cancel out antenna reflections and other anomalies in the system. These methods apply whether the distortion is within the range of the system or originate elsewhere. The picture portion can be improved greatly; much as stabilizing amplifiers reconstitute the pulse portion."
"Several approaches by which two-way CATV transportation may be achieved are reviewed. The system performance tradeoffs involved for both single-and dual-cable plants are examined. The possible performance that results from some of these tradeoffs is presented, based on both theoretical and empirical data. These include cross-modulation, carrier-to-noise ratio, and group-delay variation as dependent upon system size, channel loading, amplifier tolerance, and crossover frequency."

Minicomputers are used to control industrial processes much more complex than the transmitting system. Consideration is given to a new instrumentation and the Commission's Rules, which will be required if automatic control is implemented. The primary result of an automatic-control installation is improved control of the system. The minicomputer can be used to perform most of the diagnostic functions of the engineer."
"A PCM subcarrier system has been developed which will permit video microwave to carry 24 6-kHz channels along with the normal video signal. The channels may be used directly or split into 48 3-kHz voice channels. The subcarrier system uses a differentially coherent quadraphase approach and has a data rate of 3 Mbit."

"Television broadcasting from space, using AM/vestigal sideband (VSB) modulation, requires high satellite power. A method of reducing the necessary prime power, while maintaining signal quality, is described. The method, termed controlled-carrier transmission, is a form of automatic level control at the transmitter that permits the power supply (e.g., solar array plus power conditioner) to be designed for the average long-term power demand rather than for the maximum average power demand, for which ground transmitters are conventionally designed. By this means, power reductions on the order of 30 percent, depending on the type of power amplifier used, may be obtained resulting in significant cost and weight savings for AM broadcasting satellites. A laboratory simulation of the proposed method was set up and the resulting pictures were subjectively evaluated. These tests indicate that, for practical purposes, the average viewer found no difference between conventional and controlled-carrier transmission."
"The recent agreement (July 1971) reached by the Member countries of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which lays down the basic radio regulations, is discussed. The \"Broadcasting-Satellite Service\" is one of the space services covered in this agreement. The planning of a Broadcast-Satellite Service for the next decade (1973 to 1982) of a domestic, regional, or global system must take these radio regulations into consideration."
"The concept of linear chroma distortion permits us to express in numbers the subjective quality of the color in a TV picture.

"An electronic fader that is capable of effecting bidirectional control of program level without any mechanical effort, like rotation of the control arm of a conventional fader, is described. This fader consists of a system of flip-flops and logic circuits which, in conjunction with dual-transmission gates, switch various steps of a ladder-type attenuator to increase or decrease the program level in the output line when clock pulses are fed, respectively, to the \"forward\" or \"reverse\" bus-bars of the system. To achieve smooth variation of level during any change of attenuation, a \"make-before-break\" type of switching has been ensured by the use of pulse-stretcher circuits."

"One of the major shortcomings of models of the respiratory control system to date has been the lack of experimental verification of the validity of the models, primarily because of the lack of or inadequacy of such experimental information in the literature. For this reason, we set out to obtain experimental data for a variety of situations to be used by ourselves and by others for developing and verifying the validity of models of the respiratory control system. In one of these experimental studies the input to the system was considered to be the inspired carbon dioxide concentration and the outputs to be alveolar Pco2, tidal volume, respiratory frequency and minute ventilation. Some of the results of this study will be presented in the following paragraphs. In addition, a brief example of the use of such data in developing a model of ventilatory control will be presented."
"The diaphragm, as the major muscle in respiration, may be regarded as an electro-mechanical transducer contained in the sub-block of the controller in the respiratory feedback system. Its principal purpose is to transform the neural input, originating in the respiratory center, into a mechanical response measured in terms of transpulmonary pressure. Available physiological information and experimental results, in anesthetized animals, suggest a nonlinear tension-pressure relation where the radius of the curvature of the diaphragm is a significant factor. This paper describes the tension-pressure dynamics of the diaphragm."
"A computer simulation of muscular energetics during exercise has been developed and tested. The model and results are described."
"Changes in the vectorcardiogram (VCG) during respiration are well known. An extensive series of experiments on normal subjects has shown that the rotation of the intrinsic components of the VCG relative to the torso is a consistent indicator of the change of the volume of air in the lungs. This has lead to a model for the mechanics of the heart-lungs-respired volume system and to a technique for monitoring respiration rate and depth from the VCG."
"In earlier papers1,2 we examined the question of whether there are simple linear feedback control rules for the behavior of the money supply which reduce the instability of the rates of inflation and unemployment as compared with results under a rule by which the money supply is expanded at a constant rate. It has been argued that the lags of the effects of monetary policy on the economy are both so long and so variable as to make the optimal monetary policy one which does not respond to current economic events3. We found in our earlier work that there are simple (and plausible) feedback rules which stabilize the economy, as represented by one large model (Federal Reserve Board-M.I.T.-Pennsylvania [FMP]4) and one small quarterly econometric model (St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank [SL]5). These results were obtained by deterministic and stochastic simulation (with additive random disturbances only) of the two models."
 "The following description and analysis of a firm in atomistic competition is motivated by the need to specify a dynamic equation of price behavior to be tested on U.S. manufacturing time-series data. It will be shown that uncertainty of price information in a market composed of many competing firms leads to a model which is more or less in the Evans tradition of dynamic monopoly theory.3 The key dynamic element is the firm's reaction to customer behavior in an uncertain price situation. Price uncertainty forces newcomers to the market to search for an acceptable price which is less than the marginal utility of the good. Old customers may decide to search after a price increase, if the expected difference in search costs and price is less than the recently experienced price change. The implications of the theory are examined using a phase diagram analysis. Of particular interest for empirical study are the effects of changes in model parameters on the time path of the optimal price control equation. In line with the conclusions of the theoretical model the estimation results seem to suggest that price adjusts to a moving equilibrium path in a variable manner determined by cyclical factors in the economy."
 "Several types of well-known pseudo-canonical forms are examined. The true canonical form corresponding to each type is constructed from a complete set of independent invariants."
 "Exact models are derived for horizontal line scanning of statistically characterized images. A class of separable stationary spatial covariance functions is considered which is larger than that investigated heretofore. Recursive restoration schemes based on these models are presented for images degraded by additive noise."
"This paper is concerned with a technique of image compression through linear transformation which reduces the image information while generating a set of features for optimal image discrimination. This method consists of partitioning the original image into non-overlapping sub-images and applying the transgeneration technique to the subimages. The objective of this transgeneration technique is image data compression and feature generation that is optimal for image classification rather than for image representation. The technique is applied to transgenerate features fYom scintigraphic images for the detection of brain tumors. Some performance results for the classification of normal/abnormal classes of brain scans are presented. Some possible extensions and modifications of this work are briefly described."
"Pattern classes composed of multiple gray level imagery can be recognized through processing of feature sets extracted from measures of the gray level or intensity structures of the patterns. The absence of geometric dependence in the feature extraction method leads to the formation of feature sets which are invariant under the pattern perturbations of translation, rotation, and dilation. This paper considers the application of the gray level processing method to a two-class recognition problem where the object gray level patterns are embedded in a gray level structured background of unknown character. In attacking this problem, a preprocessing algorithm is established which dissects the pattern image into a number of subsets of connected regions as a function of gray level. A \"one at a time\" sequential minimization procedure is then employed to determine an optimal gray level subset based on a minimum distance criterion."
"The problem of enhancement of two dimensional images by recursive interpolation is considered. A nonlinear interpolator is modelled by considering the constraint that the observations of the image by a scanning device are always positive. Both linear and non-linear interpolators are implemented on a two dimensional picture when the observations are corrupted by noise. Dimensionality problems associated with interpolation are discussed and experimental results are presented."
"The Kalman filtering procedure is applied to the solution of the image enhancement problem when the image and the noise are characterized by statistical properties. Two scanning schemes are discussed. One example is presented to illustrate the technique."
"The H-matrix representation of the input/ output behavior of an asymptotically stable constant parameter linear system is discussed. The concept of a canonical representation and the measurements required to determine this representation directly are treated. The minimal complete realization problem is solved for the H-matrix representation based on exponential signals and connections between this approach and the identification and realization theories based on the Hankel matrix of Markov parameters are exhibited."
"This paper presents an explicit discussion of the canonical forms for multi input/multi output minimal systems which are implicit in equations (13)-(20) of reference [1]. The obvious advantage of these canonical forms is that they have the fewest free parameters. This becomes computationally significant in various parameter identification procedures."
 "In this paper we present three equivalent characterizations of what can be termed the zeros of a multivariable system. By establishing this equivalence a connection is made between several large bodies of literature on multivariable system problems. In particular, a polynomial which has arisen quite often in recent work on input isolation, decoupling, model matching, etc. is shown to be identical with a numerator polynomial of the Smith McMillan form of a system transfer function matrix. No proofs are presented here but they can be found in a more inclusive paper being submitted for publication [1]."
  "The necessity of filtering noisy data generated by multidimensional processes arises in many diverse settings. The direct application of the Kalman-Bucy results is hindered by dimensionality difficulties inherent in multidimensional problems. This paper shows that for linear steady-state problems significant dimensionality reductions can be accomplished thus making routine the solution of many interesting problems."
"The problem of estimating states in noisy nonsecond order distributed parameter systems, with non-linear observation, is considered for disturbances in the volume only. A least squares estimation criterion is assumed and the resulting boundary value problem is embedded in a more general class of problems. The filtering problem is solved using running stage invariant embedding, and the fixed point and fixed lag smoothing using fixed stage invariant embedding. Fixed interval smoothing algorithm is developed using a backward sweep. It is found that the smoothing estimates are independent of their error covariances. Smoothing error covariances are computed approximately using a linearization procedure. The solutions so developed degenerate into the exact solution for distributed parameter estimation if linear models are considered."
"The paper develops optimal estimation equations for operator-valued discrete-time wide-sense Markov processes. The signals are viewed as linear transformations of wide-sense martingale processes, a general representation which yields relatively simple estimates and error covariances. The infinite-dimensional results are applied to prediction, filtering and smoothing in distributed parameter systems."
"Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations are two of the most vital state variables which determine the quality of a polluted stream. The dynamics of these variables are governed by rate coefficients due to BOD removal (Kr), deoxygenation (Kd), reaeration (Ka), photosynthesis (P), respiration (R) and benthal deposits demand (B). In general, these parameters are distributed temporally and spatially and are sensitive to environmental conditions, such as temperature."
"Hyperbolic or wave like distributed parameter processes occur in a number of physical settings. Several identification techniques are discussed in this paper which are based on orthogonality relationships of these hyperbolic processes in the time variable, and on characteristic theory, respectively. The paper discusses and interprets the parameter identification process, its measurement requirements, and examples of both identifiable and non-identifiable processes."
"A general approach is presented for finding the optimal finite dimensional subspace of a prescribed dimension onto which to project the data belonging to a (higher dimensional) observation space. The approach is based on the use of suitable approximations of the functions involved, so that a variational technique may be used for the solution of the problem. The optimality criterion used is the minimization of the increase in the Bayes risk of misclassification araising from the dimensionality reduction. As an illustration of this approach, the case of two Gaussian pattern classes is considered in some detail."
"Strategies for sequential variable selection and classification are presented for a data base consisting of a network of causally related events. A system for diagnostic consultation in medicine has been developed applying these strategies."
"Recently interactive facilities based on computer graphics have been used to aid in the design of complex pattern analysis and recognition systems. One major objective of such interactive systems is to provide both software and hardware facilities to allow efficient human intervention at various levels of the design process. This paper will first outline the methodologies of a number of the existing interactive systems that have been implemented to date. Several remaining important problems are discussed to indicate how the interactive approach may better contribute to the analysis and recognition of complex pictorial patterns. An interactive facility, using a PDP-9 computer system, that is designed to assist data organization for pattern analysis and recognition will be described."
"An isolated word recognition system that uses character string encoding is described that has achieved 98% correct recognition scores on limited vocabularies (20-54 words). Speaker normalization, word segmentation, and learning paradigms have been incorporated. Audio input passes through a 6-channel octave band pass filter bank. The output of each channel is time integrated for 10 ms, and log mapped. An utterance is represented by a succession of points (a new point is generated every 10 ms) in the 6- dimensional space defined by the 6 octave bands. Reference points are scattered throughout the space. Each time interval is assigned the label of the nearest reference point. We call the resulting string of labels a \"character string\". Encoding an utterance into a character string may proceed with an arbitrary degree of precision, greater resolution resulting from the use of more reference points. Only 24 reference points are needed to achieve 98% correct recognition scores for 54 words in near real time. String generation techniques are explored. Several learning schemes based on character strings are described. Finally, experiments with a software classifier that uses \"deformable templates\" based on character strings are presented."
"Group decision-making has been a favorite topic of discussion among economists, political scientists, philosophers and even theologians! Two opposite views of social decision problems have emerged from these discussions: the collectivist view which holds that the group exists apart from its individual members; and the pluralistic approach which emphasizes that the group is equivalent to its members, when they are taken in toto. This view, of course, leads to a natural question viz the form or procedure which the decision process is to take. The problem is one of aggregation of a number of divergent opinion patterns --e.g., total orderings of a finite set of options available to society--into a group pattern which somehow strikes a balance between all parties involved. In contrast to the precision of the concept of individual preference as expressed by a definite choice of one alternative over another, the concept of social preference appears rather elusive. Social choices are made everyday but it is seldom the case that a clear-cut social preference can be recognized behind them. In brief, fuzziness is of the very essence of this concept."
"The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief informal exposition of the main ideas underlying the stability and instability criteria which have appeared in the literature in the context of feedback systems, and to show how these ideas generalize in such a way that they become applicable to much more general classes of interconnected systems. We hope to transmit at the same time an intuitive explanation of these results, an indication of the limitations of these methods, and a demonstration of their generality. Since these methods conclude stability or instability of interconnected systems by considering the individual subsystems and the interconnection laws separately, they are very well suited for the analysis of large scale systems. Another appealing aspect of these results is the fact that they make contact with various other areas of system theory as, for example, least squares optimal control, Lyapunov stability theory, and passive network synthesis. For the sake of exposition and notation, we will limit our attention to stationary continuous time systems. The ideas are easily generalized to time-varying systems and we will in fact give a time-varying example in which these results are used."
"The normed-linear-space-causality approach to feedback system stability is contrasted with the extended-normed-linear-space approach. It is argued that the definition developed here is intuitive and natural. Simple, familiar examples support this contention. The authors favor this approach for two fundamental reasons: (1) the mathematical framework for stability questions is consistent with that for other system questions and (2) the mathematical formulation is simpler."
 "We consider n-input n-output convolution feedback systems characterized by y = G * e and e = u - y, where the open-loop transfer function ĝ contains a finite number of unstable poles and the expansion ĝa(s) + ∑i=0 ĝ Gi exp(-sti). The latter is such that, i) ĝa is the Laplace transform of L1 functions, ii) t0 = 0, iii) the delay-times ti, for i = 1, 2, ..., are positive and iv) the coefficient matrices Gi form an absolutely convergent series, i.e. ∑i=0 ĝ |Gi| < ∞. Thus the subsystem represented by G is an open-loop unstable distributed parameter system. One theorem is obtained. It gives necessary and sufficient conditions for stability. A basic device is the following: the sum of the principal parts of the Laurent expansions of ĝ at the unstable poles is factored as a ratio of two right coprime polynomial matrices. There are two necessary and sufficient conditions, the first is the usual infimum one, i.e. infRe s ĝ 0 |det[I+ ĝ(s)]| > 0, and the second is required to prevent the closed-loop transfer function from being unbounded in some small neighborhood of each open-loop unstable pole. The latter condition has a nice interpretation in terms of McMillan degree theory. The modification of the theorem for the discrete-time case is immediate. The same is true if, instead of unity feedback, constant nonunity feedback represented by a nonsingular matrix is used. This allows us, through the use of the small gain theorem or the contraction mapping theorem, to consider non-linear systems, derived from the original one by introducing a non-linear time-varying gain in the forward loop."
 "The asymptotic properties of general stochastic feedback systems are examined in an operator theoretic framework. The intent is to extend the existing input-output stability theory in the presence of stochastic disturbances. The development accordingly avoids the use of Lyapunov arguments and the analytic theory of Markov processes as applied to systems with a state realization. The analysis uses the Prohorov topology as a measure of boundedness for the systems, and the criteria developed for the system operators assure the preservation of weak convergence by the feedback system as mapping from input to output. The criteria involve certain induced norms of the system functions as operators on function spaces and in this manner the theory is reminiscient of the deterministic stability theory. An example consisting of a nonlinear feedback system with a white noise gain element is given to illustrate this relationship explicitly."
"In this study, the price discrimination problem for the dynamic monopoly firm is formulated as an optimal control problem for the case where the demands are interdependent pricewise. This formulation reflects both the description of the discrimination problem as found in the literature and a dynamic demand law. The objective of the firm is to maximize, subject to constraints, the discounted value of the firm's capacity at the end of a finite interval plus the integral over a finite interval of the discounted returns from sales in the two markets less the discounted costs of production, product differentiation, and investment. The constraints are four differential equations describing the temporal rates of change in the two output prices and the temporal rates of change in the two types of capacity. There are six sets of inequalities limiting the values of the controls. The state variables are the two output prices and the two capacities; the controls are the temporal rates of change in the two output prices, the two levels of production, and the levels of investment in the two types of capacity. Initial output prices are given; terminal output prices are control parameters. Using results in control theory, decision rules for optimal pricing, production, and investment are derived and interpreted. This interpretation indicates the dynamic interaction between the pricing, producing, and investing decisions in each market."
"The purpose of this paper is to bring some simplicity and generality to the investigation of equilibrium existence in certain \"simple\" dynamic games. The way we deal with these objects is, essentially, by reducing them to what we term \"simple economies\", these latter being, from the viewpoint of equilibrium existence results, at once more general and less cumbersome. In §1, we exhibit some topological facts about a certain rather general class of simple economies, including the fact (1.7, Main Theorem) that they each possess a non-empty and compact set of equilibria. Then, in §2, we define the simple dynamic games of interest, immediately reducing them (2.5, Reduction Lemma) to the simple economies studied. In §3, we show (3.0) that the simple dynamic games in question have non-empty and compact sets of equilibria, using the fact (1.7) that the simple economies to which they reduce have such sets of equilibria. We then illustrate by example (3.3) that a general class of discrete-time, deterministic games with convex performance criteria is covered by the equilibrium existence results just described. This class includes dynamic games for which certain non-linearities in the next-State map are allowed, and for which controls are restricted to compact regions, these regions themselves varying as a function of state. Of course, we do not intend that results particularized to this quite special example be understood as the main thrust of the paper."
"A two sector macroeconomic growth model is used to determine optimal policies of consumption and investment in the two sectors of the economy. The first sector produces a general economic good and the second sector produces an activity of depollution. The performance criterion is defined by weighting the consumption and the pollution cost. An optimal control problem with singular extremals must be solved. Emphasis is given to the study of the rest point which may be reached by the economy. Numerical computations give an illustration of the usefullness of this model."
"The appropriateness of an updated open-loop stochastic control strategy for the regulation of socio-economic systems will be discussed. A near-optimal solution procedure is suggested which involves transforming the stochastic control problem into an adaptive control problem. The results of an application to regional development planning will also be discussed."
"The use of dynamic optimization should be to guide, not to command the economic policymaker. This paper develops previous work on the Bank of Canada's national econometric model RDX2, to define an indifference set for the optimal policy based on a confidence set for selected model disturbances and a sensitivity analysis of the calculated optimum. Within the indifference set a policy may be chosen on other grounds, and still represent whatever wisdom is embodied in the model and the optimization."
"The use of a simple model of a system to help optimise the control of the system is considered. It is shown that a generalisation (due to Hestenes) of the usual conjugate-gradient algorithm can be used for optimisation using models. The generalisation is derived here from the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell algorithm with non-unity initial estimate of the inverse second-derivative operator. A model is used to provide an approximation to the second-derivative operator which is potentially easier to invert than the operator for the system because the model has state dimension smaller than that for the system. Optimisations of the model are employed to generate search directions along which the control for the system is optimised. Computed results are presented for an example."
"A numerical algorithm is developed for the computation of suboptimal controls for the infinite time linear regulator problem. The utility of the algorithm with high order systems is demonstrated by generating a suboptimal control for the load frequency controller of an electrical power system."
"During recent years it has been shown that the performance of penalty function methods for constrained minimization can be improved significantly by introducing gradient type iterations for solving the dual problem. In this paper we present a new penalty function algorithm of this type which offers significant advantages over existing schemes for the case of the convex programming problem. The algorithm treats inequality constraints explicitly and can also be used for the solution of general mathematical programming problems."
"In a previous paper [1] we discussed a stochastic projected gradient algorithm (in the context of an adaptive signal detection problem) which can be used to find a constrained optimum point for a concave or convex objective function subject to linear or nonlinear constraints which form a connected region, even when we do not have the objective function available, but only have a noisy estimate of the objective function available. When the constraint consists of only one linear equation, we said that one can prove convergence to the constrained optimum value and bound the rate of convergence of the algorithm to the constrained optimum value. A proof was given in [1] under noise free conditions. The purpose of this short paper is to extend the proof to the noisy case."
"Preliminary results in the design of control systems via a well-known adapative step-size random search algorithm and a new geometric programming algorithm are presented. Three examples are included to illustrate the methods. Where relevant, some comparisons of the two algorithms are noted."
"It is frequently desired to stabilize plants with cost performances, such as the minimum time, fuel consumption, mean-square error etc. The numerical method is suitable to solve such problems, except for cases where analytical solutions can be derived. Although it is inadequate for the on-line computer control processing because of the long computing time, it may be practically used for the analysis of the characteristics of a given plant model and in search of a simple optimal feed-back control law for the real time computation. If a computer aided design program, which carries out the calculation of these processes, is obtained, it may be practically used to design the optimal control system."
"Given a signal over (o, ∞), if it can be expressed as a linear combination of exponential functions as x(t) = ∑kck exp(skt), then the expression in the frequency domain is X(s) = ∑k ck/(s-sk) or equivalently its z-transform is ∑k ck/(1-exp(skT)z-1) where T is the corresponding sampling interval. As shown by Young and Huggins [1], the construction of a set of discrete orthonormal exponentials is chosen in such a way that the poles in the z-domain are corresponding to the frequency domain poles, the zeros are chosen in such a way that as the sampling interval T approaches zero, the chosen discrete basis will approach the frequency domain orthonormal exponentials. As in the analog computation, applying Mc Donough and Huggins' criterion [2] and adaptive control principle, we will use digital computer with discrete orthonormal filter to find the best exponents for the signal representation in the sense that the sum of the squared error is minimized over the coefficients of representation and the discrete exponents used. The operation is just searching for the values of the filter parameter such that the discrete complementery signal is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by the discrete orthonormal exponentials. A simple example has been exploited to illustrate the procedure for the searching and implementation of the best exponents and the corresponding best coefficients."
"In a mobile radio system which uses many base stations to provide radio service over a large geographical area, and which has a stored-program processor to assign radio channels to base stations in real time, the queueing characteristics of the overall system are strongly dependent on the processor algorithms which are used. Three algorithms, which are in a certain minimax sense statistically optimum, are described below. The procedures are quite general, and may be usefully applied to any system which employs many servers, the use of some combinations of which is not allowed."
"A minimax estimate for the mean of an arbitrary random vector with known covariance is derived, using a standard quadratic loss function, subject to the restriction that the decision rule be linear and that the unknown mean lie in a known hyperellipsoidal subset of En. This linear minimax estimate is derived using the method of least favorable prior distributions. It is shown that there is a least favorable prior distribution which is defined by a discrete probability measure with support which lies entirely on the boundary of the hyperellipsoidal parameter space. This discrete distribution is supported by 2k points, which receive equal probability, and which are determined by the solution to a certain nonlinear algebraic matrix equation. The exponent k is equal to the rank of the covariance matrix of this least favorable prior distribution."
"This paper discusses some properties of the Stackelberg solution concept when the players use controls that are functions of the state variables of the game in addition to time. The difficulties in determining such controls are pointed out, and a simple two stage finite state discrete game is used to illustrate these properties."
 "Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to linear quadratic games (considered as Two Point Boundary Values Problems) over an infinite interval are presented. The conditions are sufficient for the existence of solntions over a finite interval. An algorithmic procedure is developed which permits assessment of the conditions and, if a solution exists, provides the optimal policy function for each player for the infinite interval game."
"The subject of this paper is the analysis of a class of decision/control problems that evolve from common problems of queueing theory in a game theoretic context. These problems possess the conceptual structure of differential games and control theory, while their analysis is based on techniques and concepts of the theory of point processes. Thus, these problems are termed point process games. In this paper typical examples are worked out in detail."
 "The design of a controller for a linear multivariable system having parameter uncertainty is explored in this paper. Linear output feedback is employed, the feedback gains being determined by a minimax technique. This is an extension of an approach used by Athans and Levine[1] for systems without parameter uncertainty."
"The estimation of a multimodal linear system whose mode-to-mode transitions are described by a finite state Markov chain is studied. A suboptimal estimator is derived which closely approximates the optimal estimator. It is shown that, in general, the suboptimal estimator reduces to the evaluation of s2 recursive Kalman-filter equations where s is the number of system modes; under certain conditions, only s Kalman-filter equations need be solved."
"Luenberger's observer is considered as an alternate to the Kalman filter for obtaining state estimates in linear discrete-time stochastic systems. An interesting new solution to the problem of constructing optimal reduced-order observers is presented. The solution contains as special cases both Kalman's optimal filter and the optimal minimal-order observer of Leondes and Novak. Also, the Tse and Athans observer is obtained as a special case of the reduced-order observer solution."
"Two results are presented in this paper. The first pertains to the use of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator as a test statistic in an Mary decision problem. In particular, it is shown that if the cost function in an M-ary decision problem is discrete quadratic, then the MMSE estimator for the decision variable can be used as a test statistic in the decision process. The second result is concerned with the performance of a MMSE estimator when the presence of the signal is uncertain. An expression is obtained for the difference between the variance of the estimation error when the presence or absence of the signal is known and when it is not known."
 "The second order terms in a modified Gaussian second order filter are investigated to determine their effect on the estimation accuracy. Conclusions indicate that the gain compensation term improves the estimation accuracy, when compared with the extended Kalman-Bucy filter."
"The importance and usefulness of the Bucy Representation Theorem in the theory of filtering and detection for nonlinear observations of an information signal in additive white Gaussian noise is by now well established. In this paper, we give an analogous representation when the information signal influences the transition rates of an observed jump process."
"The by-now classical method for the quadratic regulator problem is based on the solution of an n × n matrix nonlinear Riccati differential equation, where n is the dimension of the state-vector. Care has to be exercised in numerical solution of the Riccati equation to ensure nonnegative-definiteness of its solution, from which the optimum m × n feedback gain matrix K(•) is calculated by a further matrix multiplication. For constant-parameter systems, we present a new algorithm that requires only the solution of n(m + p) simultaneous equations: the nm elements of the feed-back gain matrix K(•) and the np elements of a rank-p square-root of the derivative of P(•), where p is the rank of the nonnegative-definite weighting matrix Q that measures the contribution of the state trajectory to the cost functional. If n is large compared with p and m, our algorithm can provide considerable computational savings over direct solution of the Riccati equation, where n(n + 1)/2 simultaneous equations have to be solved. Also the square-root feature means that with reasonable care the automatic nonnegative-definiteness of the derivative matrix-P(•) can be carried over to P(•) itself. Similar results can be obtained for indefinite Q matrices, but with n(m + 2p) equations rather than n(m + p). The equations of our algorithm have the same form as certain famous equations introduced into astrophysics by S. Chandrasekhar, which explains our terminology. The method used in the paper can also be applied to Lyapunov differential equations, as discussed in an Appendix, and to the linear least-squares estimation of stationary processes, as discussed elsewhere."
"This paper reviews some of the current technology used to record, process, and interpret seismic data. Trends in the development of new technology are also discussed with emphasis on those areas which appear to have the greatest potential."
"We have developed a computer-graphic-photographic system which uses color mimicry to display the frequency spectra of seismic events simultaneously with their time-varying waveforms. Mimicking the visible light spectrum, we have used red for the low frequencies and violet for the highs. The output of our system is a variable-area-wiggletrace seismic cross-section. The waveforms are the same as those on a conventional section; however, the variable-area part of the section appears in color. The color represents the frequency spectrum of the wavelets. Lateral changes in rock attenuation show up as color shifts on this type of display. Faults often stand out as interrupted color bands. Fault diffractions sometimes have a characteristic color signature. The cancellation of high frequencies due to misalignment of events on constant-velocity stacks can show up in color. Loss of high frequencies due to slight lateral changes in moveout velocity, and consequent trace misalignment, is often indicated by a shift toward red on a color seismic section."
"This paper presents the development of the time behavior of an arbitrary n-element adaptive array using finite dimensional spectral theory, whose performance measure is the minimum mean square criterion. In particular, an environment consisting of a target or desired emitter and one interference source is focused on and the weight trajectory, signal -to-noise power ratio and gain are evaluated."
 "For on-line estimation of the parameters of a system with unknown impulse inputs, Kalman filter does not perform adequately. A scheme has been developed to detect and estimate the impulse changes and thus obtain a rapid estimate. An example shows the desirability of the new method."
"The orthogonality between the innovations process and the one-step predicted state of a discrete-time Kalman filter is used to specify a stochastic approximation algorithm for simple, adaptive Kalman filtering. The filter is adaptive in the sense that on-line filter signals are used to train the gain matrix to its correct, steady-state form. The problem considered is one of training the gain matrix when the time-invariant plant dynamics are known, but the plant noise and observation noise covariance matrices are unknown. No direct identification of these covariances is required. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the simplicity and soundness of the proposed adaptive filter structure. The simplicity of the proposed adaptation method indicates that it might easily be implemented in real-time data or signal processing applications."
"Stochastic approximation is used to illustrate the connection between several recently proposed recursive algorithms for adaptation of array processing structures. The development illustrates the manner in which incorporation of a priori statistical information leads from one algorithm to another. This link establishes a hierarchy among the algorithms. Sufficient conditions are established to ensure convergence of the algorithms and the conditions are shown to be universal in the sense that they are independent of the particular algorithm implemented. The signal processing problem considered throughout the paper is one of estimating (in real time) the time history of a stochastic, propagating signal that is immersed in additive, propagating and nonpropagating noise. The propagating noise is sometimes called interference."
"A recently developed digital computer program capable of predicting pilot-vehicle performance, pilot model parameters, and pilot acceptance (in terms of Cooper ratings) is used to study the longitudinal flying qualities of a large aircraft. The predictions are then compared with actual in-flight simulation data and with fixed-base pilot describing function measurements. The complete package represents the largest and most recent set of data available for the pitch axis control task. The results are very promising and clearly demonstrate the utility of modern optimization techniques (used to predict man-machine performance) and identification methods (used to validate the predictions). Next, the development of a Roll Paper Pilot, similar in concept to the above Pitch computer program is outlined. The source of this development is a recent set of data obtained with a large amplitude moving-base simulator, and the resulting digital computer program can be used to evaluate aircraft lateral-directional flying qualities. Again the results are very encouraging. Finally, a brief overall summary of the status of development, applications to date, and other uses of automated man-machine digital computer programs is given. Future developments are suggested, with emphasis on non-aircraft systems."
"The increased complexity of aerospace vehicles, with emphasis on automatic controls, has considerably altered the role of the human operator in such systems. Routine, burdensome tasks previously performed by man are now automated. As a result, the human task requires a greater emphasis on the monitoring and decision making aspects than on the control problem. Any attempt to automate these decision processes or to augment them for semi-automatic procedures must necessarily be based on a quantitative understanding of human capabilities in complex decision and control tasks. Considerable data are available on the information gathering and processing aspects of human behavior. From these results mathematical models of human decision processes and adaptive behavior have been proposed for specific control situations. In this paper we survey accepted techniques and models for analyzing and predicting human performance in complex multi-control and multidisplay situations commonly found in aerospace systems. The models that we consider have been developed or proposed for the related human functions of information processing, decision making and control. This paper discusses the relative advantages, disadvantages and limitations of each of the modeling schemes. Prospects for mechanizing all or part of the decision functions performed by human operators are considered - specific examples being in the automation of human failure detection and adaption to sudden changes in the system operating conditions."
"A method is described for using nonlinear programing in the computer-aided design of airplane control systems. It is assumed that the quality of such systems depends on many criteria. These criteria are included in the constraints vector (instead of attempting to combine them into a single scalar criterion, as is usually done), and the design proceeds through a sequence of nonlinear programing solutions in which the designer varies the specification of sets of requirements levels. The method is applied to design of a lateral stability augmentation system (SAS) for a fighter airplane, in which the requirements vector is chosen from the official handling-qualities specifications. Results are shown for several simple SAS configurations designed to obtain desirable handling qualities over all design flight conditions with minimum feedback gains. The choice of the final design for each case is not unique but depends on the designer's decision as to which achievable set of requirements levels represents the best for that system. Results indicate that constant gain systems can substantially exceed the highest required levels of handling qualities in all design flight conditions of the example considered. The role of the designer as a decision maker, interacting with the computer program, is discussed. Advantages of this type of designer-computer interaction are emphasized. Desirable extensions of the method are indicated."
"An algorithm is presented for minimizing the miss distance between a state space target point and the state of a linear discrete time system subject to magnitude constraints on the control. Both the exact solution and two approximate solutions are discussed. An investigation into the usefulness of such controllers in the sampled data digital control of a linear constant continuous differential system is reported and the effect of various design parameters on the performance is discussed."
"Observer theory is used to design a digital compensator for a system with transport delay. Closed loop system poles are placed at desired locations and the compensator required to keep them there in the presence of transport delay is developed."
"The simulation and testing of adaptive control processes requires a simulation of the noise and signal environment in which the process is to take place. This environment is typically specified by a number of statistical parameters. In order to simulate the input to a system which has a bandwidth of several MHz, random events with controlled statistical properties must be generated at intervals on the order of 100 nanoseconds. This paper presents some preliminary results of studies being performed to evaluate the statistical characteristics of multi-bit random numbers generated by maximal sequence length shift registers and used to produce noise environments in signal simulation."
 "In the past few years there has been an increasing interest in the use of the computer for designing compensators of control systems.1,2,3,4,5,6 The compensator design technique presented in [1] is basically a weighted least squares fit of the actual frequency response curve to some desired frequency response. Somewhat different, the method described in [2] and [3] designs compensators by embedding the frequency response design specifications in a cost function which is then minimized with respect to the compensator coefficients. These methods are definitely an asset when used to design practical compensators for control systems; however, in some cases a priori knowledge must be used for selecting certain weighting constants, or computer programs containing these algorithms must be run several times while transmuting these constants before an acceptable design can be achieved."
"A controller design incorporating a nonlinear state reconstructor is considered for a class of unstable non-linear plants of the form &x = Ax + f(x) + Du where the state x is an n-vector, the control u is a p-vector, and A is an unstable matrix. It is assumed that f(•) is such that (1) yields a unique solution starting from any initial state x(o) and that f(x) contains only terms of second-order or greater. Measurements of the form y = Hx where H is an mxn matrix are assumed to be available as the input to the controller. The objective of the controller design is to yield an asymptotically stable closed loop system."
 "A class of Newton-like methods is introduced which is feasible for large scale minimization problems. The methods are essentially an imbedding of Gauss-Newton or Newton-type nonlinear algorithms into any of several well known linear iterative methods. The resulting composite algorithms are simple to implement, converge quickly, and require only reasonable amounts of computer storage. Numerical comparisons indicate that for optimal control problems such an approach can be superior to the conjugate direction methods in Rn."
"The last few years have seen great improvements in computational methods for solving large scale systems. In this paper we outline some of these new methods, particularly those involving improvements in the simplex method, generalized upper bounds, branch and bound methods, special ordered sets and the method of approximation programming."
"This paper presents new computational results in multilevel trajectory optimization. The original formulation of trajectory decomposition is extended and applied to a difficult multiple arc trajectory example, the low thrust interplanetary swingby problem. A numerical solution is obtained for this trajectory which is characterized by nonlinear, time variant differential equations and interior boundaries and discontinuities. The time domain decomposition of the trajectory is made at the boundaries between arc segments. A three level optimization hierarchy is employed to transform the first feasible trajectory iterate into a final solution trajectory. This example is characteristic of a large class of interplanetary swingby problems which defy solution by conventional computational methods because of multiple discontinuities, constraints, and severe numerical sensitivities. The multilevel approach appears to be effective in obtaining a solution to problems of this type when other more conventional methods are unsatisfactory."
"Adaptive control systems which improve their own performance, using information contained in their past input, output and environmental feedback signals, undergo a learning process. Consequently, a learning or self-organizing control system is defined as one which demonstrates both adaptive and memory capabilities. This paper attempts to describe the present position (as of August 1972) of learning control applications, and to give a brief account of the types of control systems that have arisen through the use of such techniques."
"In the theory of control systems, it has been noted that cybernetics begins where the possibility of mathematical description of the controlled process terminates. This statement reflects the fact that, for complex physical processes, the explicit governing equations are either unknown or computationally unfeasible to solve. Learning control systems are ideally suited for this class of problems. The four main elements of a learning control system are described with particular attention to the synthesis of a nonlinear multivariate estimator-predictor model. Two industrial process control applications are presented to demonstrate the utility of this approach."
"Remote manipulators and teleoperators have a unique potential to satisfy coming needs in space station observation, maintenance and repair of unmanned spacecraft and exploration of the moon and planets.1 Although teleoperators solve the problem of life support by allowing the operator to remain protected from the hazards of the task environment, they complicate the operator's control greatly. The associated control problems fall in one of three categories: feedback information loss, control information overload, and transmission time delays."
"In dynamic minimax and stochastic optimization problems frequently one is forced to use a suboptimal controller since the computation and implementation of the optimal controller based on dynamic programming is impractical in many cases. In this paper we study the performance of some suboptimal controllers in relation to the performance of the optimal feedback controller and the optimal open-loop controller. Attention is focused on some classes of, so called, open-loop-feed-back controllers. It is shown under quite general assumptions that these open-loop-feedback controllers perform at least as well as the optimal open-loop controller. The results are developed for general minimax problems with perfect and imperfect state information. In the latter case the open-loop-feedback controller mkes use of an estimator which is required to perform at least as well as a pure predictor in order for the results to hold. Some of the results presented have stochastic counterparts."
 "Quite often in a game there is not a strict conflict of interest among the players and they may agree to cooperate and help one another. In such cases, a solution that is Pareto-optimal is attractive since it has the property that if any other solution is used, at least one player does worse or they all do the same. The same solution concept also applies to minimization problems with several cost criteria rather than a single scalar performance index. Necessary conditions and sufficient conditions are given for Pareto-optimal solutions of static, continuous problems. Several examples are presented to illustrate the theory."
"The concept of Pareto optimality and the concept of Max Inf condition are used to give a new definition of Optimality for a coalition of players. A necessary condition and a sufficient condition are proved for a class of topological games by using the approach of the theory of Reachability for Perturbed System."
"A distributed parameter model for a class of search and capture problems in the plane is derived. The output is a time-varying simple loop in R2 and the input a moving line segment. The applications discussed include destroyer search, oil spill clearance, forest fire control and fishing. Circular motion is shown to produce a non-trivial steady-state region whenever the velocity ratio between searcher and evader attains a computed critical value."
"In this paper the realization question for infinite dimensional linear systems is examined for both bounded and unbounded operators. In addition to obtaining realizability criteria covering the basic cases, we discuss the relationship between canonical realizations of the same system. What one finds is that the set of transfer functions which are realizable by triples (A,b,c) with A bounded is related in a close way, to the space of complex functions analytic and square integrable on the disk |s| < 1 and that the set of transfer functions which are realizable by triples (A,b,c) with A unbounded but generating a strongly continuous semigroup is related in a close way to functions analytic and square Integrable on a half-plane."
"By making use of Huyghen's principle we are able to show that processes modelled by the wave equation in an odd number of space variables are controllable in finite time by means of control forces applied at the boundary of the spatial region in question. The introduction of certain concepts from harmonic analysis together with use of the Fourier transform enables us to apply this result to prove the finite time controllability of processes modelled by the heat equation in the same spatial region by means of similar boundary controls."
"In this short version of a more detailled work of BEGIS-GLOWINSKI to appear, we shall consider briefly an optimization of domain problem, for a convenient class of feasible bidimensional domains in which occurs a stationary diffusion phenomenon. All results will be given without proof."
"This paper is concerned with System Properties of a class of systems described by functional differential equations of the delay-type. Some results on controlability are presented for a very general class. For linear time invariant delay-systems the above results are put in a more concrete form using spectral decompositions. In this framework, conditions for state and output stabilizability are derived. These conditions constitute the main result of the paper. Detailed proofs and more extensive comments may be found in [1] [2]."
"This paper outlines the development of Filtering Theory for stochastic hereditary differential systems. It uses the model of hereditary differential systems developed by Delfour and Mitter and the results of Bensoussan on Estimation theory in Hilbert spaces."
"A four-level technique is described for estimation of aerodynamic moment coefficient, Mα, normal acceleration force coefficient, Zα, and velocity, V. These parameters are associated with a simplified model of pitch plane dynamics for a tactical missile. Contrary to past studies where aerodynamic parameters were estimated from measurements which are very difficult to obtain (e.g., angle of attack), it is shown herein how estimates of the above parameters can be realized from measurements which are more easily obtained. Specifically, parameters are estimated from measurements of rate, normal acceleration, and gimbal angle deflection."
 "The identification of parameters in the beam equation is investigated. The equations are assumed known to within a set of unknown constant parameters. The boundary and initial conditions associated with the Partial Differential Equation (PDE) are assumed known explicitly. This paper utilizes Galerkin's Criterion of the Method of Weighted Residuals (MWR) to transform the PDE problem into an ordinary differential equation problem. The step by step identification procedure is illustrated by the identification of parameters in the beam equation. A test apparatus was constructed and the parameters of the test beam were identified using the actual measurements as input data for the identification procedure."
"The problem of systematically determining the optimal design for an unmanned Mars-roving vehicle is considered. A system model, identifying all feasible designs, is generated by consideration of the physical constraints on the design parameters, and the requirement that the system be deliverable to the Mars surface. An expression which evaluates system performance relative to mission goals is developed. The model and objective function together allow simulation of the effects of design trade-offs upon system performance for all feasible designs. Nonlinear programming techniques are utilized to identify the optimal design."
 "In this paper we consider a continuous-time stochastic process which is described by a differential equation with unknown order and unknown coefficients. The input to the process is unobservable and assumed to be white; the output can be measured but is corrupted by noise. The problem is to estimate the order and coefficients of the differential equation solely from the output data. The approach taken here is to form sample correlations from output data and then derive the spectral density function from these correlations. The order can be determined from observing the degree of dependency among sample correlations and the coefficients are calculated from the spectral density function. The concept of optimally spacing the sample correlations for the purpose of order and coefficient estimation is introduced and discussed in detail."
"The objective of this analysis is to determine a method for controlling left-turning traffic while minimizing the total delay in the intersection. A left-turn may be performed using a left-turn phase or an uncontrolled turn. When a controlled left-turn phase is used, a special turning phase is given to the turning stream, resulting in some delay to the turning vehicles and an increased delay to the other traffic streams in the intersection. The delay in this case can be found using the results given by Webster [1]. On the other hand, if an uncontrolled left-turn is performed, the opposing on-going stream is given the right-of-way while the turning vehicles may turn only if an acceptable gap in the opposing stream occurs. Consequently, the turning vehicles form a queue while waiting for an opportunity to turn. Note that in this case the turning vehicles do not add to the delay of other traffic streams and they cause only the delay incurred by themselves. Thus, in order to compare the delay caused by left-turning vehicles under the two methods, it is necessary to find the delay caused to the left-turning stream under an uncontrolled turn."
"Highway engineers have been interested in developing objective criteria for designing and maintaining highways based on roadway riding quality for many years. This paper describes a model which provides a measure of riding quality based on power spectral estimates from roadway profile. A combination of spectral analysis and multiple regression analysis techniques is used for obtaining this model. The paper also presents a brief discussion of previous modeling methods for obtaining highway riding quality and provides comments on the possible extension of highway riding quality modeling methods to the problems of developing high speed mass transit systems."
 "The construction of a qualitative theory of climate change based on systems theory is discussed. Specifically, the importance of initial conditions, nonlinearities, feedback mechanisms, forcing functions and stability concepts, as they pertain to the climatic behavior of the Earth are shown. Suggestions regarding areas of prime importance are advanced and feedback mechanisms are identified. The paper serves three goals: (1) provides a first approximation qualitative model outline, useful for subsequent quantitative calculations regarding climate change, (2) introduces systems theorists to the subject of climate, and (3) summarizes current literature in the field of climate behavior, its modification and simulation. A first-approximation, quantitative model based on the principles discussed in this paper will be the subject of a second paper."
"The problem of functional minimization by means of random searching is discussed. Two previously proposed algorithms, Adaptive Step Size Random Search (ASSRS) and Randomized Pattern Search (RANPAT), are evaluated on several functions which were chosen so as to be difficult if not impossible to minimize using simple gradient search techniques. The experimental evaluation of the ASSRS and RANPAT algorithms leads to the development of a proposed hybrid random search algorithm, Adaptive Randomized Pattern Search (ARPS). Comparisons of these three algorithms indicates that ARPS is at least comparable to ASSRS and RANPAT on all the functions examined, and that ARPS is significantly better on the several functions which have constrained parameter spaces."
"This paper presents some novel approaches which are useful for identifying, filtering, and smoothing a finite number of graphs or signals which are simultaneously present, assuming that some or all of the a priori information about the function of the signals, such as form and parameters, is known. Under some circumstances, such as seismic wave detection in connection with oil exploration experiments, only the discrete data points are available. Traditionally, when these discrete data points are scattered over a two-dimensional space they are processed manually, using a family of templates. The algorithms developed in this work will enable us to process these data points with the use of digital computers. This paper tries to answer the questions such as: \"What is the best algorithm to process data of this kind in order to achieve optimal usage of the available data and accuracy of identification?\" \"What is the required computer memory capacity and speed of convergence of the algorithms?\" etc."
"The well-known minimum fuel problem for linear discrete systems is equated to that of finding a specific solution to a system of m linear equations in n unknown variables. This solution turns out to be the so-called minimum l1 solution of functional analysis. A method for obtaining the minimum l1 solution is developed by considering the associated dual problem of functional analysis. A finite iterative procedure is then presented for efficiently obtaining the desired solution."
"An approximate method is presented for the synthesis of an optimal control of distributed parameter systems, based on a combination of the ideas of Lyapunov's direct method and those of Bellman's successive approximations in policy space. The method is such that the approximate equation is improved after each iteration in the sense of the performance index being used."
"A class of linear, stochastic, jump parameter systems is studied in which the probability law of the parameter processes depends upon the control policy used. An optimal controller is given when the loss function is quadratic. Because of difficulties inherent in the design equations, a more easily evaluated, near optimal controller is provided for problems in which the parameter processes are weakly dependent on the control policy."
"The complementary variational principle developed in a Hilbert space setting provides a duality principle in the calculus of variations with dynamic constraints. This concept is adopted in this paper to investigate dual characterizations of optimal control systems. Systems under consideration include those with dynamics governed by linear ordinary differential equations, linear partial differential equations and non-linear ordinary differential equations."
"A suboptimal approach for terminal feedback control of nonlinear systems which may include time-varying parameters is presented. The scheme is adaptive in nature and viability is established with simulation results for first, the stationary Van der Pol equation and second, for the more meaningful nonstationary, two dimensional missile intercept problem. The distinctive advantages over other approaches include: (1) no nominal solution is required; (2) no assumed form of suboptimal control law is required; (3) the procedure is applicable to terminal (target set) control problems and (4) the present scheme is more suitable for terminal control of nonlinear, non-stationary systems in real-time applications than existing optimal and suboptimal approaches."
"A manufacturing system is looked upon as a black box whose input vector is an r-tuple of planning decisions where each decision is a series of pulse functions in the time-domain, and whose output vector is an r-tuple of actual manufacturing capacities which is the response of the black box to the planning decisions. This response is described by a linear difference equation including transport lag (i.e., delay). The cost functional of the system is non-convex due to set up charges. In this paper, a method is discussed to determine the optimal planning decisions to minimize the cost using a discrete version of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle that gets around the problem of the increase in dimensionality caused by the delay term in the system equation."
"The increasing emphasis on the application of engineering principles to a wide range of social problems results from a number of social forces. To meet the challenge, \"engineering\" must be redefined broadly. This article discusses a set of possible goals and specific strategies for educating a new breed of socio-technological systems engineers and to facilitate the permeation of social orientation in engineering education. One of the most signigicant trends in the engineering profession today is the increasing emphasis on the application of engineering principles to help solve a wide range of important social problems in education, health, communications, transportation, public safety, environment, urban development, etc. The purpose of this article is to discuss the implications of this trend and a possible strategy for the corresponding reorientation in engineering education."
"The company with which I am associated, Systems Control, Inc., currently employs 150 people. Most of the company's technical staff has received formal systems engineering, and approximately half hold the Ph.D. degree. The company does a significant fraction of its business in areas where social and economic factors are significant considerations; these include urban planning, water and air quality monitoring, control or sewage treatment plants, urban transportation, air traffic control, human operator modelling, corporate modelling, and industrial and public utility demand forecasting. While relatively few of our staff members obtained degrees in fields with titles that can be construed as equivalent to \"societal systems engineering,\" nevertheless, many of the recent graduates have received some formal training in this direction as part of their systems engineering curriculum. I would like to comment on the present and projected value of this training to an organization such as ours."
 "The purpose of this report is to summarize the opinions and discussions presented by members of the informal group that surveyed the state of the art in modern system science and control theory and to summarize certain of the recommendations dealing with needs for future developments in both theory and algorithmic approaches. The members of the informal group that contributed to this exchange of ideas were: L.A. Zadeh, J.C. Willems, P.P. Varayia, E. Gilbert, H.J. Kushner, R. Drenick, Y.C. Ho, R. Baum, D. Kendrick, A.P. Sage, and M. Athans. Other workshop attendees also participated in a part time basis. It should be noted that the material contained in this report represents the interpretation by the author of the many remarks voiced at the Workshop meeting; it probably does not represent an exact consensus of each and every member of the discussion group."
   "The technical and capital coefficients of a dynamic regional input-output model are being revised to include the costs of installing and operating air pollution abatement equipment. The total cost of air pollution abatement in the region will be estimated by comparing the value of direct and indirect inputs required to produce a fixed bill of goods before and after the installation of abatement equipment."
"In this paper an approach to the construction of a regional input-output model for the analysis of solid waste problems is outlined. Building upon an available conventional regional input-output model, three models are presented, each nested inside the other, and leading to the proposed model. They are: (a) Simple model of production and waste generation, (b) Production and waste disposition model, and (c) Production, disposition and reclamation model. An approach to the assessment of the role of the material reclamation industries in a regional economy is suggested. It centers on the contribution material reclamation industries make to total output of conventional producing industries. The analysis suggests the way to the evaluation of material reclamation industries (which tend also to reclaim unutilized labor) in terms of a broad regional development policy related to solid waste management."
"Within a systems approach to environmental management, this paper emphasizes the development of a residuals accounting structure. This emissions accounting system has been designed to provide information required for analyzing economic-environmental relationships, especially within the context of familiar input-output models. The system is based upon materials balance as the guiding principle."
"The materials presented herein contain projections of pollutant generation, emission and cost of control in the United States for the thirty year period 1970- 2000. The data shown have been obtained from Environmental Implications of Technological and Economic Change for the United States, 1967-2000,1 a completed input-output model and from \"Economic Costs Associated with the Environmental Quality Alternatives in the United States, 1970, 1980 and 1985,\"2 also an input-output methodology as yet incomplete."
"This tutorial paper is designed to direct the interested reader to pertinent references from which the relationship of Walsh functions to signal processing can be obtained. In addition brief arguments are presented for comparison of the Walsh transform and other unitary transformations for various analyses, a brief list of application areas is included for the sake of completeness."
"In this Paper, we summarize a set of properties of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and compare them with corresponding properties of the Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT) [see Table I]. It is hoped that such a summary will assist in observing the analogy between Walsh-Hadamard and discrete Fourier analyses for those who are relatively more familiar with the latter."
"This paper is basically tutorial in nature. Hence, its purpose is to introduce the Walsh set of functions, Walsh transform and some of the basic properties of these two formulations. The method of defining Walsh functions as products of Rademacher functions is adopted here. These functions are then extended to the generalized Walsh functions; and consequently the Walsh transform is introduced. The notion of a delta function for Walsh analysis is developed along the lines of the classical Fourier analysis. And finally, relations connecting Walsh and Fourier transforms are derived."
"Instruments yielding the Walsh spectrum of a signal in real time are faster than the corresponding Fourier analyzers, and they require substantially less hardware. The hardware savings are particularly significant for parallel processing of Walsh or Fourier coefficients. If, after measurement, a Fourier spectrum is needed from a given Walsh spectrum, then a special-purpose processor or a programmed general-purpose computer may be used to perform the conversion."
"In this paper, an analysis package is put forth for use in a profit-oriented carrier for the following routing and scheduling questions. From the competition and traffic potential point of view, (i) should the carrier enter into a Civil Aeronautics Board (C.A.B.) authorized market in providing service between the city pair; (ii) if market entry is warranted, should the city pair be served by a non-stop, multi-stop route, connecting service or certain combinations of the three?"
"The success of the air transportation industry depends to a great extent on its scheduling ability. Faced with limited time, rising costs, competitive actions, and uncertain markets, the airlines must select a profitable set of flight schedules from a vast number of possibilities. For the larger airlines, the process has grown to include a number of computer-based aids. However, airline scheduling is still more of an art than a science and continues to challenge the mathematician, systems engineer, and computer specialist, as well as the schedulers, themselves."
"Typically, investments in transportation have involved large-scale, durable facilities with significant long-term consequences on both the environment and even the very lifestyle of a region. Traditional solutions to transportation problems have ignored the fact that significant changes have occurred over the last few years, however, in the demand for transportation, in the transportation technologies available, and most importantly in the way people value transportation service. The value of many current approaches to investment planning has been severely limited because they ignore these changes and the other uncertainties inherent in the planning environment. This paper presents an application of the general sequential decision model and an adaptive strategic approach to transport planning which lends itself to handling both uncertainties in future demands, technologies and values and to a more incremental staged sequential solution to the transport investment problem. A Bayesian learning model is developed which considers both the flexibility of the staged strategic approach as well as the flexibility and adaptability of technologies."
"A computer program has been developed to compute the trajectories of vehicles and platoons of vehicles as they move through an urban street network and on a freeway. It can be used to generate traffic patterns and determine performance measures for a wide variety of control strategies and is a new tool for the evaluation and design of candidate traffic control policies. SCOT (Simulation of COrridor Traffic) is a computer program designed to simulate traffic flow within an urban freeway corridor. It contains two basic algorithms: one for the movement of platoons on a freeway and the other for the movement of individual vehicles on the freeway ramps, service roads, major arterials and city streets. These models have been interfaced so the system-wide effect of a proposed control policy may be assessed. A study was made using the urban simulation model of SCOT to design and evaluate a sequence of traffic signal schedules for a section of a major arterial in Boston and the results are discussed in this report. Current studies include the application of SCOT to traffic responsive control systems for the evaluation of a variety of freeway ramp metering and bus priority strategies."
"Freight terminals represent a major problem in the transportation industry's ability to provide good freight service. Terminal control systems utilizing computers and detection devices are being developed in order to improve the efficiency of terminal operations. Motor carrier and air freight terminals utilize cathode ray tube devices to transfer data to and from a central computer or other freight terminals. The larger rail and marine terminal utilize minicomputer controlled systems which often incorporate automatic car identification scanners. Three significant terminal systems are being, or have recently been, developed: a Chicago area rail terminal information system; an intermodal railroad piggyback terminal control system; and a marine terminal control system. In addition to providing operational control, terminal control systems provide management with statistical analysis capabilities unattainable in the past. Chief among these is performance measurement which further improves the efficiency of terminal operations."
"The problem of classifying samples from a population into one of N classes is considered. Several classification algorithms are investigated, including a nearest mean method and one involving a constant learning parameter. However, the most effective method consists of using a Kalman filter to recursively estimate the vector of probabilities of occurrence for the N classes. The probabilities for the classes conditioned only on the current observation are used for the classification decision and also serve as pseudo-measurements into the Kalman filter. Extensive numerical results are presented for automatic identification of six classes of feed grain."
"This paper presents some novel results concerning the recognition of single-font printed Chinese characters via the transformation algorithms of Fourier, Hadamard, and Rapid. The new design philosophy of a three-stage structure is believed to offer at least a suboptimal search strategy for recognizing printed Chinese characters with a dictionary of 7000 - 8000 characters. The transformation algorithms discussed in this paper will be used in the last two stages. Extensive experiments and simulations concerning feature extraction and noisy or abnormal pattern recognition have been carried out (the simulations have been restricted to a 63-character subset called \"Radicals\"). Comparison has been made of all three transforms according to their ability to recognize characters."
"A heuristic technique is presented for detecting the presence of an unknown signal in noise and estimating its waveshape. The heuristic utilizes the most recent estimate of the waveshape as a template against which new observations are matched. If the match is \"good,\" the observation is used to update the estimate and the procedure is repeated. If the match is \"poor\" the observation is discarded. It is the decisions of the detector which direct the evolution of the estimate while simultaneously the current estimate directs the detector's performance. The mutual interactions of the estimator/detector are conducted without external supervision and without the benefit of training samples and so the system falls into the category of a self-learning decision directed adaptive system."
 "The key measure of performance in a pattern recognition problem is the cost of making a decision. For the special case in which the relative cost of a correct decision is zero and the relative cost of an incorrect decision is unity, this cost is equal to the probability of an incorrect decision or error. A pattern recognition system may be viewed as a decision rule which transforms measurements into class assignments. The Bayes error is the minimum achievable error, where the minimization is with respect to all decision rules. The Bayes error is a function of the prior probabilities and the probability density functions of the respective classes. Unfortunately, in many applications, the probability density functions are unknown and therefore the Bayes error is unknown."
 "It is often necessary to have the statistical parameters periodically updated during the processing of remotely sensed multispectral scanner data. As is well known, one of the factors causing the degradation in classification accuracy is the variability of data due to the gradual changes in the spectral, spatial, temporal and other conditions. If an adaptation of these variabilities can be properly made, the performance accuracy of a processing system will undoubtedly be enhanced and the multispectral pattern recognition capabilities will be greatly extended to longer duration and/or larger area surveys."
 "In this paper we examine a class of stochastic optimization problems characterized by nondifferentiability of the objective function. It is shown that in many cases the expected value of the objective function is differentiable and thus the resulting optimization problem can be analyzed and solved by using classical analytical or numerical methods. The results are subsequently applied to the solution of a class of stochastic programming problems."
"For the finite-horizon linear discrete quadratic stochastic control problem the control is restricted to be a memoryless linear transformation of the measurement. The two point boundary value problem that specifies the feedback gain matrices is derived and an algorithm for solving it given. An example is solved comparing the cost of the suboptimal control to the optimal control."
"Previous formulations [2] of the \"Separation Theorem\" for a stochastic linear system have excluded terminal conditions and instead used a quadratic performance index. It is shown herein for the discrete-control case that it is possible to have one (or possibly more) stochastic terminal condition, such that a linear combination of the expected terminal state conditioned on the current measurement set shall be a specified number, within certain broad restrictions. A quadratic performance index may also be specified. The calculus of variations is used to derive the necessary conditions, leading to the use of expected values of the costate, Lagrange multiplier and future control, all conditioned on the current measurement set. In a general example based on planar missile guidance, it is specified that the expected miss distance shall be zero, while the quadratic performance index weights the terminal Yd, i.e., rate of missile-target separation perpendicular to the original line-of-sight. A closed-form solution for the optimal control is found, with a term proportional to the expected, zero-effort, miss distance and a second term proportional to the expected, zero-effort, terminal Yd."
 "An algorithm for adaptive minimum variance control of unknown plants in unknown environments is presented. The derivation of the algorithm is based on the use of least-square techniques. Experimental results show that for stationary plants of known order the adaptive controller converges to the true optimal controller. An algorithm that exhibits exponential forgetting is suggested for use in the non-stationary case and simulations show that the performance of the controller approaches very well the optimal performance."
"Over the past several years a variety of highly automated operational control concepts have been suggested as possible solutions to the problem of safe and efficient management of high density air traffic and as a means for increasing airport capacity. The Autonetics Division of North American Rockwell has undertaken a study to evaluate the merits of these concepts and to establish the performance requirements for the subsystems involved in their mechanization."
"Performance measures for the evaluation of advanced Air Traffic Control concepts are developed and applied to a number of proposed systems. Distributed control has the potential for reducing cost, increasing capacity and reducing risk relative to centralized systems. The concept requires that traffic information be available in the cockpit."
 "The Problem of evaluating the relative effectiveness of various air traffic control systems can be formulated as that of comparing their levels of safety at any fixed capacity. In the research presented here, a new mathematical model of this problem is developed in which aircraft collision probabilities are related to the control concept through certain parameters that statistically describe the uncontrolled (or nominal) traffic pattern and the performance of the selected control system. The performance parameters considered describe the abilities of the system to monitor the airspace, predict conflicts, generate commands, and execute avoidance maneuvers; and can be used to model many control structures, both ground-based and airborne. The analysis performed is thus an extension and synthesis of previous work in which the important characteristics of each control function are identified and related to the probability of collision. The use of the proposed model is illustrated by applying it to a parametric evaluation of several different control concepts of current interest. Specifically, and for a traffic pattern in which all aircraft are nominally flying with constant velocities and in which avoidance maneuvers are limited to straight, steady climbs or dives, collision probabilities are calculated and compared for: blind flying (no control), the see and be seen concept, PPI's and ground controllers, airborne pilot warning indicators, and collision detection and avoidance systems based on the TAU criterion. Methods for extending these results to curvilinear flight paths with lateral avoidance maneuvers and more general control concepts are briefly discussed."
"Decision making strategies and the use of computer technology are discussed relative to the needs of health care delivery. Research interest in this area will be increasing, relative to the implementation of Section 769A(2) of the Comprehensive Health Manpower Act of 1971 legislated by the 92nd Congress. This paper is an introduction to the general problem of integrating engineering and compute science with health care delivery."
"Various approaches to texture analysis will be described and related to problems in biomedical pattern recognition. The feasibility of the various methods will be discussed, and new methods of computing for texture analysis will be described. Special application to chest X rays is discussed."
 "The study of human chromosomes with respect to the health monitoring, clinical karyotyping, abnormality detection, and genetic counseling, has urged the development of an efficient automatic system to improve the speed, reliability and capacity for chromosome analysis and classification 1-5. Prior to 1970, chromosomes in blood cells were analyzed in terms of their size and gross morphology. In normal cells, there are forty-six chromosomes which form twenty-two homologous pairs plus two sex chromosomes, XX or XY. These twenty-two homologous pairs of chromosomes are divided into seven groups: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G groups. There are seven pairs in C-group, three pairs in A-, D-, E-groups, and two pairs in B-, F-, and G-groups. The size and shape of X-chromosomes are similar to those of C-chromosomes, and the size and shape of Y-chromosomes similar to those of G-chromosomes. The identification and karyotyping of chromosomes images are usually done based on measurements of choromosome arm length, centromere position, and integrated optical density which represents the amount of DNA in the chro- mosome3,6. The optical density profile of a chromosome image along its longitudinal axis was sometimes used to determine the chromosome's centromere which corresponds to the location of the minimum point on the density profile7,8. Recently, such density profiles have also been used in automatic recognition of radiation induced chromosome aberrations, in particular, the recognition of dicentrics among the normal chromo- somes9. From the optical density profiles the amplitudes of the thrid through twelfth spatial spectral components were selected as features, the dicentrics were properly detected in a study involving seven irradiated human blood cells."
"The feasibility of automatic diagnosis of pneumoconiosis using digital image analysis techniques was investigated. Normal/abnormal diagnosis was done first. Differential diagnosis was not attempted at this stage. Normal/abnormal classification scheme is based on a technique which makes use of individual lung lobe histograms. The magnitude of the first relative peak in the normalized histogram indicates the extent of the nodular patterns that characterize pneumoconiosis. For the abnormal lung lobe this value is higher than that for a normal one. This criterion is used for normal/abnormal classification. The results are encouraging enough to propose an automated pneumoconiosis diagnosis system. Differential diagnosis will be attempted by analyzing the nodular lung pattern. The size, number, and location of the nodularities will be used for differential diagnosis."
"The present paper describes some digital techniques to track rapid variations of the Alpha voltage in an electroencephalogram. The results obtained by different digital techniques are compared with those obtained by the standard technique."
"The use of the computer as a radiological tool has received much attention within the past few years. A constantly expanding population, a demand for improved medical care, a limited number of radiologists, and the substantial number of films to be viewed have contributed to the interest. Computer diagnosis could provide the radiologist with speedier analysis, more accurate measurements, and greater percentage of correct diagnoses. A major step in the automated processing of radiographic images is extraction of significant features from a background of irrelevant detail. Many algorithms, including template matching, contour trace, region enumeration, linguistic approaches, and statistical analysis have been applied to this problem with varying success. In order to implement an automated system of scene analysis, the pictorial information is represented in a digital form and processed on an IBM 360/50."
"This research is directed toward the development of a scheduling algorithm for large digital computer systems. To meet this goal, methods of adaptive control and pattern recognition are applied. Simulation studies indicated that the scheduler was able to adapt to changing workloads and it improved the turnaround times significantly."
"This paper presents a generalized threshold type criterion for the design of control laws in adaptive sampling systems. It is shown that this single criterion can provide a family of sampling interval control laws which are identical to many well known results reported in the past based on a variety of design philosophies. In addition, some new control laws are readily obtainable. Therefore, this new approach can be regarded as the most systematic treatment to date for the problem of adaptive sampling systems design."
"A new method is presented for controlling a discrete-time linear system with, possibly time-varying, random parameters in the presence of input and output noise. The cost is assumed to be quadratic in the state and control. Previous algorithms for the above problem when the system had both zeroes and poles unknown were of the open-loop feedback type, i.e., they did not take into account that future observations will be made. Therefore, even though these schemes were adaptive, their learning was \"accidental\". In contrast to this, the new approach uses an expression of the optimal cost-to-go that exhibits the dual purpose of the control: learning and control. The effect of the present control on the future estimation (\"learning\") appears explicitly in the cost used in the stochastic dynamic programming equation. The resulting sequence of controls, which is of the closed-loop type, is shown via simulations to appropriately divide its energy between the learning and the control purposes. Therefore, this control is called actively adaptive because it regulates the speed and amount of learning as required by the performance index. The simulations on a third order system with six unknown parameters also demonstrate the computational feasibility of the proposed algorithm."
"This paper considers the suboptimal stochastic control of linear discrete-time dynamical systems with unknown or stochastically varying parameters. The sub-optimal scheme is based upon the use of the open-loop-feedback-optimal (O.L.F.O.) method. The state and parameter estimates are generated by an extended Kalman filter algorithm. Numerical results for first order systems are presented."
"Closed-loop and open-loop controls are found for systems with unknown parameters. Use of the prior information is made by objectively inferring prior probability distributions for the unknown parameters and then selecting the control gains which minimize the resulting risks."
"Sevaral algorithms appear scattered throughout the current literature which treat, in one form or another, problems which may be loosely categorized as belonging to the discipline of performance-adaptive self-organizing control. The need arises, therefore, to determine the usefulness of these algorithms to problems of interest and to ascertain in some way the advantages and shortcomings of the various available schemes. To this end the work presented here is part of an investigation made into the computational aspects of performance-adaptive self-organizing control algorithms. The investigation appeared in the form of a critical evaluation and comparison of the various methods relative to common qualitative and quantitative criteria. From the results of these evaluations and comparisons, conclusions were drawn concerning the relative merit of each scheme. The results of the application of several self-organizing schemes for one particular example, a non-linear heat treatment process, are presented here."
"A random variable is said to have elliptical distribution if its density is a function of a quadratic form. This class includes the Gaussian and many other useful densities. It is shown in this paper that (a) this class of densities can be expressed as integrals of a set of Gaussian densities invariant under linear transformation; (b) the conditional expectation is linear with exactly the same form as the Gaussian case. Many estimation results of Gaussian case can be readily extended. Problems of computing optimal estimation, filtering, stochastic control and team decisions in various linear systems become tractable."
"Recursive robust filtering for a discrete, linear stochastic system with additive white noise disturbances is considered. The initial state and plant disturbances are assumed to be Gaussian and the partial covariance of each measurement over a finite region is assumed bounded from below. A soft limiter and patched-Gaussian density are shown to be the optimal min-max estimator and the least favorable measurement density, respectively. An approximate filter is proposed and an example is given."
"New data processing algorithms with a parallel structure are developed and applied. These algorithms Implemented on modern parallel computers should provide a substantial reduction of computation time for data processing. The particular algorithms discussed provided filtered and smoothed estimates for continuous system."
"Wiener and Kalman-Bucy estimation problems assume that models describing the signal and noise stochastic processes are exactly known. When this modeling information, i.e., the signal and noise spectral densities for Wiener filter and the signal and noise dynamic system and disturbing noise representations for Kalman-Bucy filtering, is inexactly known, then the filter's performance is suboptimal and may even exhibit apparent divergence. In this paper a system is designed whereby the actual estimation error covariance is bounded by the covariance calculated by the estimator. Therefore, the estimator obtains a bound on the actual error covariance which is not available, and also prevents its apparent divergence. The bounding filter can be of lower order than the original stochastic models; hence, a technique is devised of reducing the order of the filtering system and concurrently obtaining a figure of merit for its performance. For many cases, the design conditions devised for the steady state Wiener filter apply to transient K/B filter performance."
"A new type of nonlinear filter, called the E-Filter, is introduced that involves a transformation of the independent variable of the input function. It is shown how an E-Filter can be designed to filter out superimposed \"noise\" on a signal leaving the large peaks of the signal unattenuated. Unlike a low-pass linear filter, the low-pass E-Filter is almost frequency independent and so does not effect the amplitudes of large sharp peaks of the signal. It can be shown that the E-Filter can be realized in real time and that a wide class of E-Filters have a filtering action which is independent at the D.C. level of the input signal."
 "The problem of population management of herd animals is discussed. A discrete stochastic model is described and can be successfully optimized by the use of modern control theory."
"Forrester's Urban Dynamics and the criticism which it received provide a set of axioms which should guide the second generation of urban model builders. An urban model currently under development which follows these axioms is outlined, and a detailed description of the sector of that model dealing with the educational process is presented."
"An approach is presented for planning a health care system on a regional basis. The major components of the process are embodied in four computerized models: a demographic model; a facilities location model; a regional and local model of the interactions of physicians, patients and facilities; and a model which uses dynamic programming to determine the best strategy to follow in sequentially altering the health care system. Each of these models is described and representative results from each are presented."
"Mental health care is a major public sector problem in the State of New York. We were asked by the Ways and Means Committee of the New York State Assembly to recommend a new fiscal structure with shared funding between the state and the counties to better achieve the objective of the state's mental health care program. A simulation model was developed for analysis and used to design new funding plans. The results of our analysis have been written into legislation introduced into the New York State Assembly. A detailed explanation of the model we developed and the analysis we performed will be appearing in the September - October, 1972 issue of the Journal of Operations Research under the title \"Financing Mental Health Services in the State of New York\" by Lawrence Bodin, T. Owen Carroll, Allen Lee and Sally Stout."
"Economic planning has recently begun to focus on a new dimension: that of anticipating the manpower, educational and skill requirements likely to result from different patterns of economic and social development. The U. S. record in this area thus far has not been encouraging, and the present difficulties faced by job seekers in many fields of engineering and natural sciences-and in a number of other professional disciplines-attest to the failure of educational and manpower planning in this nation in the late 1950's and the 1960's. This paper discusses a large-scale manpower and educational planning model presently being developed at the Center for Advanced Computation (CAC) of the University of Illinois. This model is unique in several respects: it utillzes a number of detailed data sets available from the Federal government which have not previously been integrated in a coherent manner, it is a user oriented system which allows it to be employed by persons unfamiliar with economic modeling or computer software, and it can accept inputs and deliver outputs nationwide via ARPANET facilities. A brief overview of the system is presented, the results of several empirical analyses conducted with components of the model are discussed, and the prospects for continued implementation and development of this type of system are indicated."
"The feedback stochastic decision rule is developed for potential buffer stock agencies in cocoa. This rule prescribes the values of policy variables as a linear function of actually observed endogenous variables with time-varying coefficients which reflect the social welfare and is derived by, first, solving the deterministic non-linear optimization problem, and, second, by tracking the deviations of endogenous variables from their deterministic optimal paths. The welfare function is chosen as a weighted sum of the three eminently desirable objectives, export earnings, price stability and earnings stability. Instead of arbitrarily fixing the weights, we vary them within certain ranges so that policy-makers could be presented with a set of \"possibility trade-offs\" among our three objectives. The weights on price stability and earnings stability are inferred from simulation results. All of these results should be considered demonstrative rather than prescriptive. We also develop new solution algorithms for the deterministic control based on Jacobson's and Mayne's (1970) first-order DDP which allow for both non-negativity constraints and implicit dynamic systems and apply these to solve the 20-state variable, thirty three period non-linear model of the world cocoa markets developed by Goreux (1972). Since our algorithms converge slowly near the optimum, we employ the convergence criterion that computation is halted when no further improvement in the welfare functional can be made with the first-order DDP. As far as our experiments are concerned, the welfare gain vary from 17 to 20 percent of the welfare function computed before control. While the solution for the case of quadratic welfare and linear dynamic model itself requires no more than multiplying and adding matrices, it is a formidable work to calculate all second-order partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian. For practical implementation, therefore, it would be desirable to calculate all partial derivatives by computer techniques."
 "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is annually faced with the problem of determining which of several proposed civil works projects to fund. Each project has a specified cost. Furthermore, each project can contribute benefits in a number of different categories; for example, a water reservoir project may contribute benefits in the categories of flood control, power generation, river navigation, general recreation, conservation of fish and wildlife, water quality control, municipal and industrial water supply, irrigation, and other categories. Previous work by the Corps of Engineers has resulted in the development of methods for quantifying the benefit produced in a specific category by a particular project. However, because each project produces a multiplicity of benefits of a variety of types, a straightforward project selection procedure based on benefit cost ratios has obvious shortcomings. Many benefits have natural physical units of measure, but are difficult to measure in dollars. Even if all benefits could be assessed in dollars, they often accrue to different population segments and are hence qualitatively different. An uncritical summation even in this case may result in a loss of information relevant to the decision maker(s). Finally, a yes or no decision on a particular project should be made in the context of other projects with similar benefits which are competing for a part of the same limited supply of capital resources. Thus the desirability of a given project is dependent upon decisions made with respect to other related projects. Explicit consideration should therefore be given to sets of projects acting in concert. The purpose of this paper is to describe a computer program developed by the authors for use by Corps of Engineers planners as an aid in the project selection process. This program is based on a formulation of the multibenefit project selection problem as an integer programming problem. A specialized integer programming code developed by the first author is used to obtain specific solutions. The program can consider as many as 125 projects, each of which can produce benefits in any of 50 benefit categories. Computation times for typical problems are on the order of one minute for a UNIVAC 1108. The paper first summarizes the basic problem formulation. The integer programming algorithm for solving the program is then described. Finally, a summary of computational experience is prescribed."
"Monte Carlo simulation results demonstrate the validity of the theoretical approach developed recently for optimal filter design and tracking filter error analysis for dense multitarget environments. The predicted error divergence phenomenon is shown to be observed experimentally and to be characterized by an increasing frequency of lost tracks as density increases.

"A detailed state-space model of an automatic voltage regulator and exciter-generator unit is developed which provides for saturation in both exciter and synchronous machine. Via a perturbation analysis and Liapunov's first method, the effect of varying the non- dynamic parameters of the excitation system on overall unit stability is studied. Critical parameters and their optimal setting ranges are identified. It is shown that without due regard for these critical regions, the stability limit of the generation unit can be made less favorable on auto matic control than on manual control."
"Breakdown of transformer oil is affected not only by electrostatic field configurations, but also by many other factors. The latters make it difficult to predict break- down voltage from electrostatic field, as made for air and S F6 gaps. Alternatively, many experimenters tried to express the breakdown stress of oil as a function of stressed oil volume. But, results are limited to their respective electrodes."
"Unit-connected generators are connected to the system through an individual main step-up transformer. Their associated potential transformers used for instrumentation, control and relaying, are commonly energized from the generator leads. Based upon industry- wide experience and practice, this report gives recommendations covering types of potential transformer, primary and secondary circuit arrangements and fusing. Account is taken of generator grounding methods and ground relay protection."
"The skin effect in circularly symmetric structures is formulated in terms of an integral equation, which may be solved in terms of the normal modes of the corresponding integral equation eigenvalue problem. The necessary modal functions are computed numerically, using a simple discrete model of the coil. The modal series solution easily accounts for electrical excitation of the coil as for external magnetic fields. A comparison with so-called \"direct\" calculation methods, as well as with published experimental results, shows that the method is capable of good accuracy, while effecting substantial economies in computation."
"The axially laminated anisotropic reluctance motor, while promising superior operating characteristics is also provingmore difficult-to analyse than other types of reluctance motor. The reason being that not only the external magnetic dissymmetry but also the internal magnetic anisotropy must be considered. The basic theory behind the design of an axially laminated rotor is outlined, followed by the calculation of the flux density distribution using numerical methods. The effects of such design parameters as stacking factor of the laminations, degree of anisotropy of the laminations and pole span are considered."
"The synchronous operating characteristics of an axially laminated, magnetically anisotropic rotor reluctance motor are calculated from its physical dimensions using the two-axis approach. Modifications have been made in the ideal theory for the computation of axis-reactances to incorporate the effects arising from the practical considerations such as saturation in stator teeth iron, fringing flux and the rotor stacking factor. The validity of the analytical technique is clearly established by comparison of the predicted and measured results of a test machine which show remarkable agreement."

"The procIedure of predicting the radio noise (RN) performance of transmission lines, including ultrahigh voltage (UHV) levels, is outlined. The innovations against former publications on this subject are: 1) A complex eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis using Carson's earth correction terms is applied to RN analysis; 2) A new method of treating the phase correlation between modal noise fields is incorporated; 3) The METIFOR weather model is applied, yielding expected radio reception quality in statistical terms."
"As systems have increased in size and complexity, and as the number of firm-power ties between systems have increased, the nature of the system stability problems has changed. Furthermore, there is also a demand for more accurate engineering analysis of these complex problems. Although much effort has been devoted to searching for alternate methods, the practical and effective method for large-scale studies is still the simulation of the system response, with time, following a prescribed disturbance. This emphasis on\u007f simulation necessarily requires system and equipment models which adequately represent their behavior over some time span, usually less than 20 seconds."
"Dynamic energy balance is a new technique for power system dynamic simulation. It requires about one tenth the computatioanl effort of a transient stability study yet gives similar results so far as frequency transients are concerned. Applications, methodology and comparison with a transient stability study are treated in this paper."
"A method of dynamic aggregation is introduced to define power system transient stability indices based on the previously used concepts of potential and kinetic energies. The indices are easier to compute and less conservative than those introduced by other authors. They reflect quantitatively the seriousness of the system instability threat created by actual or postulated faults. They are thus useful for purposes of on-line system security monitoring and interpretation of transient stability studies."
"The compensation theorem is applied in conjunction with ordered triangular factorization of the nodal admittance matrix to simulate the effect of changes in the passive elements of the network on the solution of a problem without changing the factorization. The scheme includes network elements with mutual impedances. Compared with impedance matrix methods which are ordinarily used for power system applications, this method, which permits exploitation of matrix sparsity, always requires less computer storage and, with few exceptions, is much faster."
"This paper summarizes the results of an investigation into the use of hybrid computer systems for the solution of problems associated with the generation and transmission of electrical power. In particular the study was conducted to determine if hybrid computing techniques could result in the capability of real time, or faster, transient stability studies. It was determined that a special purpose hybrid system could provide simulations of power system transient disturbances 100 times faster than real time."
"As generating facilities increase in size, number and complexity, the impact of maintenance schedules on power system reliability and cost also increases. This paper describes a technique and a computer program which have been developed as an operating and planning tool for scheduling the maintenance of generating facilities. The technique is a method for generating maintenance schedules which increase reliability and meet all practical scheduling constraints. The paper includes a description of the maintenance scheduling problem, the model on which the scheduling technique is based, and a description of the optimization technique. The model used in the program can be applied to large systems and recognizes a comprehensive set of scheduling constraints, including the availability of crews, outdoor units, past and pre-scheduled maintenance, maintenance of auxiliary equipment and others. The maintenance of each unit is scheduled so that the interrelated constraints on the system are resolved and so that the minimum net reserve in the schedule is maximized. The approach and the program can also be applied to the coordination of maintenance within power pools. Program input and output are shown for the application of the program to a sample system."
"Extending the theoretical foundations established in Part I(1), this paper further describes this efficient method of computing the real-time load flow solution for a power system network.

Results are discussed for the cases with and without the rotor in place as well as with solid and incipient faults. The detection procedure is simplified by an indicating-lamp go/no-go type fault indicator."

"A bundle of 4 subconductors 2-in (5.08 cm) in diameter was tested on the Project UHV single-phase test line. Radio noise, corona loss, audible noise, electrostatic field effects were continuously measured in order to investigate the effects of weather variables. Translation of the results to a 1000-kV, 3-phase line shows that audible noise will be the main obstacle to the use of this bundle."

"This paper describes the theoretical relations between currents, fluxes and pulse duration in a DC motor energized by power pulses. From these values, the average torque and speed as well as their instantaneous variations are calculated. The non-linearity of the magnetic circuit is considered by a suitable approximation of the magnetization curve and the resulting error is evaluated. Numerical examples illustrate the characteristics of a shunt and series motor for several types of pulse control. A companion paper1 discusses in detail different braking methods, proprietory commutation phenomenons and additional iron and copper losses. Also, a Fourier analysis of the current pulses is presented."
"This paper, as a continuation of a companicn paper discusses the adaptation of the basic differential equations of the pulsed DC series motor for several braking methods, resulting again in expressions predicting the duration of pulse periods, required pulse frequencies and resulting current and torque values. Furthermore, equations for commutation phenomenons and additional iron losses, as caused by the pulsing armature current, are derived. Finally, the pulsing armature current is represented by an exact and approximate Fourier Series."
"The model studied is comprised of thermal and hydro plants as well as electrical and hydro networks. It incorporates such features as variable water heads and cascaded plants, taking into account time delays as well as spilling. The transmission network is described by electrical equations. The model also includes such constraints as bounds on the equipment ratings and operating conditions."
"A solid insulating barrier in a point-to-plate gap is a useful means for raising the positive flashover voltage. This paper examines the voltage-current-characteristic during positive and negative surge breakdown in air of the so-called barrier arrangement. The model used has a strike distance of 6 cm and a barrier of various dimensions. Photographs detail the discharge propagation. The flashover voltage depends upon position, thickness, and size of the barrier. Voltage stages of relatively constant value, lasting up to 30 Ms, suggest additional application as, surge protective device."

"This report presents results of investigation into the pollution performance of disc insulators with M& E ratings of 66,000-, 90,000- and 120,900-lbs. intended to be used for UHV systems compared with others. Fog type disc insulators have a withstand voltage 140 to 160% of the corresponding standard disc insulators. Withstand voltage is proportional to string length up to 500 kv (860 kv phase-to-phase). An insulator with larger diameter has a lower withstand voltage per leakage distance if pollutant deposit density is the same, and collects less pollutant deposit in a naturally polluted atmosphere."
"This paper presents anti-pollution design criteria for line and station insulators based on investigation of performance of various insulators under artificial pollution tests. Field pollution areas were classified into six classes; AA, A, B, C, D and E according to pollution degree. Recommended leakage distance for disc insulators per 1 kV of nominal line-to- line voltage are 0.75\", 0.9\", 1.0\" and 1.1 \" for A, B, C and D areas respectively. Considerable increase in leakage distance is necessary for cylindrical post insulators and porcelain shells with increase in average diameter."
"This paper decribes a high voltage laboratory testIng program of artificially dust-contaminated cap and pin insulators. Several factors are found to influence the flashover characteristics including : the method of voltage applications the rate of wetting of the contaminated insulators, and the duration of the high voltage test. The 50% o flashover voltage is found to be proportional to the number of insulator units per string while the relative dispersion decreases considerably for longer strings, Within the range investitated. Flashover characteristics of artificially and naturally contaminated insulators are compared. Due consideration is given to the statistical nature of the problem which determines the volume of the tests involved. Flashover values are shown to belong to a population characterized by a gaussian distribution and a procedure for optimizing the number of necessary tests is developed."
"The performance of transmission line insulators under contaminated conditions is affected by many variables, one of which is the configuration of the string on the tower. Reported field experience indicates that horizontal and Vee strings perform better than vertical. A series of laboratory tests designed to investigate the effect of configuration on performance is described in this paper. The tests included two test methods, several insulator types, and simulated natural washing of contaminated strings."

"Oscillographic records of the mercury arc valve disturbances experienced at the Sylmar Converter Station (the southern terminus of the Pacific Northwest-Southwest HVDC Intertie) are presented and discussed. The disturbances experienced include arc-throughs, arc-backs, consequential arc-backs and a new disturbance combination called a simultaneous arc-back. This presentation will provide a reference for mercury arc valve disturbance characteristics, and their effects on both the valve bridge outputs and the entire HVDC system."
"Recently proposed methods of direct digital control for HVDC Convertors require the existence of transducers capable of providing fast and accurate logical information. Among the signals required, the beginning and end of conduction of convertor valves and the correct voltage crossovers present the greatest difficulty. The response of transducers based on different principles is investigated for ON-OFF current detection; Hall Effect and differentiating current transformers are found to satisfy the requirements of direct digital control. A set of possible voltage crossover sequences obtained from a comprehensive test involving convertor disturbances and weak a. c. systems, is used to develop a logical scheme to select the correct crossings."
"The rates of recovery of dielectric strength of gasblasted SF6 arc channels following current interruption have been measured by using the free recovery method. The experiments were performed with upstream arc chamber pressures of 35 psia and 60 psia, with a 1 cm electrode spacing, and 400 μs duration square current pulses whose amplitude was varied between 20 A and 1000 A. These arc chamber pressures were sufficient to ensure that critical pressure and sonic velocity occurred near the nozzle throat. An empirical linearization of the recovery characteristics has enabled these dc results to be translated into terms of ac circuits. This has enabled a prediction of ac interruption capability to be determined, assuming that the arc power input does not approach the energy clogging regime."
"Experimental measurements of the dielectric recovery rate of blown SF6 arc channels in a nozzle, following the interruption of 400 sμec duration square current pulses of amplitudes between 20 A and 1000 A, have been made; the electrode spacing was 1 cm, and the upstream arc chamber pressure was either 35 psia or 60 psia."
"This paper transforms the equations for the dynamic arc radius R(x, t), obtained from a boundary layer analysis of a circuit breaker arc, into equations for the heat flux potential S(x, t). The key assumption underlying the transformation is that in the vicinity of current zero, the thermal storage in the arc column is controlled by changes in arc temperature rather than arc area. It is shown that the boundary layer theory of a circuit breaker arc can account for changes in arc temperature as well as arc area, and that boundary layer solutions for a linear current ramp are readily transformed into solutions for the heat flux potential approaching current zero. To apply these solutions, an order of magnitude analysis is made of a turbulence parameter. For a 100 ampere arc, calculations based on the analytical solutions show the effect of turbulence level oni the quasi-steady arc temperature, the time constant, arc conductance, voltage gradient, Reynolds number and the current zero temperature following a linear current ramp. Finally, the analytical solutions have been compared with exact numerical solutions of the boundary layer equations, and the analytical and numerical estimates of temperature, time constant, and voltage gradient have been correlated for a pressure of 10 atmospheres."
"Potential gradient at the surface of the electrode is the most important factor in the breakdown of SF6 gas gaps as has been reported in the previous papers. 1, 2"
"A 550 kV circuit breaker has been developed which demonstrates the feasibility of meeting the anticipated stringent switching surge limitation of UHV transmission systems of 1100 kV and above. This improved circuit breaker with two-step resistor insertion and a timed closing system limits switching surges to 1.5 per unit in 98% of the closing operations with a maximum of 1.65 per unit. The paper contains a description and the results of verification tests of the circuit breaker and the timed closing system which made meeting these requirements practical."
"This paper presents principles and procedures to be used by member companies of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection to establish normal and emergency thermal ratings for non-enclosed disconnecting switches affecting the Interconnection. The resulting ratings can be used for selecting the most economical nameplate ratings for new disconnecting switches. Disconnecting switches built under C37.30-19622 and prior standards and also C37.30-197X2 are included. A complete review was made of switch characteristics, thermal loading, and rating methods. The rating method is presented in the form of formulas, nomographs and tables for determination of switch ratings. All companies of the Interconnection have agreed upon the rating determinations to ensure consistent ratings for any given disconnecting switch application."
"The increase in number and size of outdoor switchgear installations up to the highest service voltages has led to the development of a new single column isolator of the pantograph design. This paper describes the design and operation as well as the tests to which this isolator was subjected."
"This paper summarizes effects of various AC shock currents on humans and animals and cites a number of practical situations, as- sociated with high voltage transmission which may lead to shock hazard. The material presented is limited to electrostatically induced voltages and currents. A companion paper describes methods of solving prob- lems in electrostatic coupling."
"This paper interprets electrostatically coupled objects in circuit form, reduces the problem to Thevenin equivalents, and develops practical methods for computing such equivalents. Means for representing irregularly shaped objects, both by analytical and analog methods are discussed. A companion paper describes the effects of induced currents on humans and animals, and cites examples of hazards sometimes encountered in operation of high voltage lines."
"A method of analysis and a digital simulation of surges on polyphase EHV transmission lines with earth return are presented. The analysis allows mathematical calculations of switching surge wavefronts and gives a better insight into the distortions of the waves due to the earth-resistance. This digital simulation is easy and straightforward. It is based on the property \"the more the ground-mode propagates, the more its delay increases\". Simulated curves are found to be in good agreement with analytical results and with test oscillograms."
"Simplified and general expressions are presented which allow an easy calculation of earth-effects on polyphase line parameters. The analysis permits the use of Laplace operational calculus and allows also the application of matrix methods to the study of wave propagation. The results obtained are in good agreement with those calculated, in terms of frequency, by more complicated theories."
"A first-order asymptotic approximation to the distributed series impedance of an overhead transmission line with ground return (frequency-dependent resistance) is insufficient for the prediction of the step-function response at distances of a mile (1. 6km) or more from the source. Series solutions based on a third-order asymptotic impedance approximation have useful convergence properties only for distances up to perhaps three miles. An empirical impedance function, designed to approximate the true function closely over a finite band of somewhat more than one decade, and utilizing corrective terms proportional to √s exp (-k1,√s) and s exp (-k2 √s), yields a series solution which is usable for much longer distances. These series solutions predict a more rapid rise in voltage than does the first-order asymptotic approximation and they indicate that, at distances of more than a few miles, rise time tends to be directly proportional to the distance."
"A method of analysis convenient for the simulation of transposed and untransposed transmission systems is set forth, and the facility of the hybrid computer in studying the traveling waves on these systems is illustrated. In particular, computer results are given showing the electric transients during line charging of a 3-phase, transposed system as well as the traveling waves on transposed and untransposed 3- phase systems during 3-phase and line-to-ground faults. Also presented are computer results showing the line-charging transients of two mutual- ly coupled, untransposed, 3-phase transmission systems. The material presented in this paper should permit a broader base from which to evaluate the various methods of analysis and simulation of traveling waves on transmission systems."
"In a indoor U. H. V. laboratory, the parameters governing the knowledge of a given high impulse voltage phenomena are emphasized by the geometrical size of the circuit and must therefore be carefully studied. The way \"Les Renardieres\" U. H. V. laboratory has endeavoured to have a better knowledge of its impulse measuring systems is presented and discussed."
"Because the wide variety of generating and measuring systems for impulse voltages produces a large variety of impulse shapes to be measured, blanket requirements for measuring systems become much too stringent. Attempts to ease the requirements by assuming simple impulse shapes have resulted in Standards which are excessively severe for some conditions and insufficiently so for others. To over- come this, it is proposed that the maximum frequency which can be present in a system be estimated on the basis of the physical size of the system and that a specific characteristic of the measuring system's step response be controlled to ensure that this frequency will be detected when present on a test object with a significant amplitude. The output oscillogram from any particular measurement is then used to establish which frequencies and perturbations are actually present on the test voltage and the appropriate characteristics of the step response are used to evaluate the accuracy with which they are measured. The ideas developed here are the basis for a proposed revisiton of an international standard for impulse measurements."
"By applying an optical measuring system, which consist of light emitting diode, optical fiber light guide and photomultiplier, a high quality shielded resistance divider for impulse voltage measurements, whose response time is less than 5 ns, has been obtained. The characteristics have been verified experimentally."
"Up to now there is no detailed study dealing with the problems concerning the measurements of the highest d. c. voltages. The sphere gap is the only device recognized and normally used, but there are many doubts on its behaviour expecially as far as the accuracy is concerned. Additional causes of uncertainty are related to correction factors for atmospheric conditions and to the exact knowledge of the characteristics of very high ohmic voltage dividers, for which a precise and therefore difficult calibration must be required. This paper reports the results of a research on the behaviour of the sphere-gaps. The performance of the rod-rod gap is also examined with a view to the possibility of using it as measuring device. Finally the problem of defining a withstand test voltage is briefly discussed."
"The application of probability methods to the determination of generating capacity spinning reserve requirements has been illustrated in several publications (1,2,3). The basic difference between a static capacity reserve study and a spinning reserve study is in the time period considered. The basic statistics in the first case are the probabilities of finding the existing and proposed units in various states at some time in the relatively distant future. In the spinning reserve case, the probabilities of having load carrying capability within the next few hours are required given that the system resides in a particular state at time zero. In each case, the actual system load is a variable and can be described by a probability distribution."
"There has been a considerable amount of work done in the area of static capacity reliability evaluation in interconnected systems. The first important paper in this subject1 utilized a two dimensional probability array upon which the tie line constraints were imposed. The basic generating unit statistics in static and spinning reserve studies are fundamentally different and in the latter case the problem is a question of will the capacity immediately available to the system be capable of satisfying the load in the event of possible capacity and load changes. The possible assistance under these conditions from an interconnected system cannot therefore be neglected in determining the risk of just carrying or failing to carry the system load. In a static capacity interconnected system study, the tie line is normally rated at its nominal value. In a spinning study, the tie line rating or inter-system transfer capability will depend upon the immediate and known conditions between each system, i. e., the existing transmission configuration, the scheduled generation pattern, etc. etc. These could be quite variable even over the course of a day."
"This paper presents a general, systematic formulation of the problem of dynamic analysis of multi-machine power systems for digital simulation. The analysis utilizes a generalized machine model which enables one to consider the affect of network response in more detail than described in the literature. The techniques of solution are discussed in order to indicate the structure of numerical computation."
"Dynamical behavior of T section is studied to determine whether vibrations occur under the aerodynamic action of wind. Two kinds of vibrations due to wind forces may occur and both have been investigated: 1) self-excited vibrations due to lift and drag variations and 2) forced vibrations self-controlled through vortex shedding."
"Otter Tail Power Company uprated a 90-mile section of 115 kV wood-pole transmission line to 230 kV in 1967. This paper reports the operating performance of that line and additional uprated lines during the past four years."
"During unbalanced conditions the dynamic performance of HVDC transmission systems connected to weak ac systems depends strongly upon the control systems of the dc link. Different new grid control systems and closed-loop control methods have been developed. The principles of these new control systems are described in Part I of this paper. Part II deals with the results obtained with these methods during steady-state and dynamic operation under balanced and unbalanced conditions as well as with the harmonic content in the associated ac networks."
"The performance of HVDC systems depends to a great extent on the control methods used. The performance of the control methods described in Part I of this paper is investigated under steadystate and transient conditions. Attention is also given to the problem of harmonics in the ac system. The results show that all the described methods are suitable for HVDC operation on weak ac systems. The choice of the proper control method in a given case depends on the requirements which are to be met by the HVDC system as a whole."
"A method of calculating turn-off overvoltages in a high voltage dc thyristor valve, and a computer program to perform the calculations, are presented. The effects of the statistical distribution of storage charge among thyristors and of valve and system parameters on turn-off overvoltages are shown through results of calculations for a representative thyristor valve. These results are supported by measurements performed on a model valve. The techniques presented are useful for valve design, and for optimization of valve and system parameters. The results presented are valuable in clarifying the effects of important parameters on valve performance."
"The decision to use power line carrier as the communications medium for protection of the American Electric Power (AEP) System is related to the general development and success of its use here and abroad. AEP has successfully used power line carrier almost exclusively for these functions on lines of all system voltages since its conception. Factors, both limiting and advantageous are discussed as related to the decision to continue its use for 765-kV protection."
"The important mode parameters were measured on 765-kV conductors. The measured data compared well with previously published results. However, some of the calculated results indicate certain inadequacies in the measurement technique, which may require certain modifications before further measurements are made in the future."
"This paper describes the basic approach taken in designing special SSB power line carrier equipment using baseband injection for the protection of AEP's 765-kV lines, and the unusual means for coupling these PLC signals to the transmission system in a most efficient and reliable manner through a three phase connection. Attenuation and impedance data measured with the coupling equipment connected to a 200 mile long line are included."
"The analysis of unbalanced power systems depends usually on transformation methods by which the phase quantities are substituted by, for example, symmetrical component quantities. These transformations had the computational advantages in the past, but with the use of digital computer, they no longer appear to be necessary. In this paper the analysis of power system faults including the simultaneous ones has been undertaken with the help of phase coordinates, i. e., the actual system phase voltages, currents and impedances. This approach is found to be simple and readily adaptable to digital computer techniques. Symmetrical components are, however, used as a measure of the system unbalance."
"Analysis of simultaneous unbalances and transient recovery voltages of power system has been undertaken in this paper. The approach is similar to the one developed in Part I of this paper. The method requires only the assembly of the nodal admittance or impedance matrices of various elements of a power system and subsequent solution of sets of linear algebraic equations subjected to constraints. The transient analysis of a power system having untransposed transmission lines can be carried out by the application of modified Foruier transform and the steady state theory of natural modes. Finally a digital computer can be programmed to calculate the magnitudes of the fault currents and active recovery voltages."
"In considering the problem of quantitative evaluation of the reliability of a power system for planning purposes, the authors show the advisability of making use of a couple of risk indices in terms of curtailed energy and abruptly disconnected power."
"The conditional probability of a unit not being available given a demand occasion is developed using a four-state Markov model. The authoring Task Group recommends that the developed conditional probability be used in place of Forced Outage Rate for capacity planning studies, especially when the application is for units in peaking or cycling service. The Forced Outage Rate parameter has been recognized to be unsuitable as a measure of outage risk when unit annual service hours are low. This paper describes other models which have been used or offered in addressing the problem. After reviewing available models and known associated work, the Task Group developed the recommended four-state model."
"The methods available for transmission system reliability evaluation are briefly discussed in this paper. The conditional probability approach described earlier by the authors is extended in this paper to include Markov models of load and component states. A simple system study is included to illustrate- the several methods."
"This paper developes the fundamental principles of applying probability calculations to the analysis of generating-capacity reserve requirements for two or more interconnected power systems. Building on concepts developed for a single power system, the authors analyze the effect of emergency support interaction between interconnected, but otherwise independent systems."
"The following bibliography of published material dealing with the application of probability techniques in the evaluation of power system reliability does not contain all the material available on this subject. It does, however, include most of the publications readily available in a power utility or technical reference library together with some of the earlier papers in the field. The many excellent publications clearly indicate the increasing usage and interest in the application of probability methods in the evaluation of power system reliability."
"Guided by the experience that real power is most sensitive to nodal phase angles and reactive power to voltage magnitudes, a new method of power flow optimization is developed which exploits this decoupling and consequently reduces problem size. This decomposition of the real and reactive equations results in the formation of two subproblems-one corresponding to the real power equations and the other to the reactive power equations. In practice, the two subproblems are alternatively solved until the desired accuracy is attained. The method has considerable potential for real time applications such as voltage control, economic dispatch, security analysis, etc., where in many situations the solution of only one subproblem will be required. The algorithm was originally developed for applications related to system security and for this purpose linear programming is used for optimizing each of the subproblems. A test case study of a 38-node network demonstrates the convergence properties of the algorithm."
"Analysis of an area within a large interconnected power system under various system configurations and load conditions is often needed in off-and on-line applications. Equivalence isolates the study area and represents the rest of the system by a simplified equivalent model. A new and more comprehensive approach to the equivalence problem is presented which emphasizes the design and operational aspects rather than conventional network reduction, and which is based on meeting application-specified operational requirements. Results from a test case demonstrate the validity and accuracy of the method as applied to outage analysis load flow studies."
"Non-iterative methods for solving partial differential equations are modified by the insertion of a matrix exponential transformation. The resulting algorithms are suitable for the study of transients in lines with either constant or variable parameters. A simple nonlinear line serves as an illustration."
"Transient valve currents are derived for rectifier short circuits with consideration of transient control behavior, and filter and ac system representation. A comparison is made between connection of the filters on the ac side and tertiary of the covnverter transformer. The valve currents are also analysed for different types of singly-occurring and repetitive commutation failures. The analysis, in each case, has been processed by dynamic digital computation and is considered to be of particular relevance to the current surge ratings of thyristor valves within HVdc converter installations."

"This paper reviews the phenomena of the interaction between switching arcs and electric circuits around current zero and indicates the consequences for high power circuit-breaker testing. The merits and limits of the voltage race theory are discussed and the interaction theory is used to explain current chopping, thermal reignition and short-line fault severity. This provides the basis of a better understanding of test requirements, especially of synthetic testing, and also the subsequent special papers."
"This paper covers backgrounds of current zero measurement in investigations on interruption of high short circuit currents. After analyzing the complex network formed by the outer tube, resistance tube and potential lead of a coaxial shunt, typical LF and HF performance is described. Also attention is paid to construction details in connection with electromagnetic forces, accuracy, acceptable temperature rise and precautions against double grounding."
"This paper reviews some statistical aspects of high voltage and high power tests with respect to standardization requirements. Impulse voltage test and short-circuit breaking current test are used to illustrate possible trends of future standardization."
"The testing of recent high voltage circuit breakers under short line fault conditions requires the use of artificial lines. The deviations between the recovery voltages produced by the artificial lines used in testing and those produced by real lines has been calculated as a function of the number of sections in the artificial line."
"Technology is always facing to the increasing requirements from industry in the field of testing power circuit breakers. In order to cope with the growing capability of breakers required and to meet the accumulation of more precise knowledge of modern age, continuing review on the basic process of testing is always of essential importance. In the paper some fundamental problems concerning transient recovery voltage are discussed in connection with the short circuit testing of modern power circuit breakers. The validity and usefulness of combined application of unit test and synthetic test are demonstrated based on some recent studies in the laboratory authors are associated with."
"This paper outlines the main short-circuit tests performed by Electricitéde France on large transformers (5 to 300 MVA, 63 to 400 kV). Following a description of the main characteristics of the transformers tested, the specifications used, and the available means of testing, the author indicates methods of testing and results obtained. The conclusion includes mention of projects for the coming years."
"Generator breakers in high-power testing fields, the back-up breakers, have the function of safety breakers: they have to protect both the generator and the test breaker from being overstressed by a short-circuit current of undesired duration. The heavy short-circuit currents of modern generators enforce the development of generator circuit-breakers of high breaking capacities. In this paper a generator c. b. is described having a rated breaking capacity of 160 kA at a service voltage of 15.4 kV. This circuit-breaker is a half-cycle breaker capable of interrupting a symmetrical current at the first current zero passage. Due to its short minimum arcing time this breaker is suitable for syn- chronized breaking operations and so permits an economical testing of circuit-breakers. This testing method is also described."
"The random behaviour of circuit breakers requires the application of testing methods based on statistical approach. Technical information provided by different testing procedures are compared. Experience achieved during years of comparison tests between direct and synthetic methods is discussed on statistical basis. The \"up and down\" method is proposed as a suitable mean to investigate the circuit-breaker performance with small samples. The power of this method is stressed to explore the low failure probability region."
"This paper describes a device which will provide precise control in the initiation of very high currents required for testing circuit breakers and other power system components. A triggered vacuum gap is used for initiation of current and is then quickly shunted by an electromechanical device for continuous conduction. Application of this device and test results are discussed in detail."
"The complication of additional equipment and controls required for synthetic testing necessitates special care in circuit arrangement, switching device design, and instrumentation. Detailed methods developed by the authors for ensuring accuracy and security of control and consistency of operation are described. These methods include the use of a special trigatron, phase shifting of the trigatron gap current, a high accuracy current transformer, D-C voltage control, magnetic current zero anticipation, light pipe coupling, integrating filters, and inductive compensation of measuring shunts and voltage dividers."
"This paper is a contribution to work on the problems of synthetic testing under short line fault conditions. The various factors which must be taken into account when assessing validity are discussed, and the experimental evidences to support the validity of the parallel current injection method are described. The paper also deals with the severest current range in short line fault conditions for different types of circuit breakers."
"A new synthetic testing circuit, intended mainly for E. H. V. circuit breaker tests is being described. Based on the well known idea of parallel current injection method, the circuit is created in the form of several, integrated stages. The adjustment of the circuit test voltage to the rated voltage of the tested breaker is made by connecting the stages in series, in parallel or in a series-parallel combination. This arrangement creates a special type of a combined current and voltage impulse generator."
"This paper gives some information about the problem of unit testing on high-voltage circuit-breakers. A theoretical investigation of the problem shows that statistical treatment is necessary and that the kind of the breaking process (dielectric or thermal reignition) is also very important. A large number of power tests with one and two units of an airblast breaker are presented. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical investigations. Therefore, direct or synthetic unit testing is not only an economical, but also a valid method for short circuit testing high-voltage circuit-breakers."
"In order to test high voltage circuit breakers in high power stations, efforts are being made to create a test circuit that will produce the same conditions as in actual power systems. To simulate these conditions, resistors in series and in parallel with a capacitor have been interposed in the test circuit to represent the system encompassing the breaker. Recent studies have revealed that capacitance, near the circuit-breaker, can have considerable influence on the breaking capacity of these breakers. This paper is concerned with the influence of parallel capacitors on test circuits and gives the parameters for accurate control of the initial shape of the TRV."
"There is a need for increased capacity short-circuit Laboratories. In that view Electricite de France is building a new test station, supplied from the 400 kV network and from 2 generators - Direct short-circuit capacity will be higher than 6,000 MVA for single phase tests - Synthetic testing will increase that capacity to 30,000 to 60,000 MVA (single phase) - 400 kV supply is now ready, and the first short-circuit transformer was successfully tested in October 1970. Operation is intended to start in 1973."
"In testing circuit breakers quick determination of the test circuit power factor and its adjustment are necessary to ensure proper test conditions. A fast power factor measuring device using sampling techniques is described in this paper. This device provides an output voltage linearly proportional to the power factor."
"The new USA Standard proposal for Transient Recovery Voltage ratings for high voltage circuit-breakers requires careful consideration of circuit parameters during testing. The new requirements can be met partly in simple circuits and completely in a special circuit. These circuits are described in this paper."
"High power laboratories contemplating the addition or expansion of synthetic testing techniques may choose to develop a circuit from a number of schemes already in use or proposed. Some offer refinements and extended capabilities which appear attractive but may add complications that offset the benefits expected."
"Different types of artificial lines for synthetic circuits suitablefor simulating an actual short circuited line in the wide fault conditions occurring in the net work were built up. Practical conclusions on the line elements design and on the performance of the differ ent lines were obtained. Particular care has been taken in analysingthe initial portion of line transient recovery voltage. The artificial line, which more strictly reproduces the transient recovery voltage of an actual line taking into account extreme fault conditions, is outlined. Testing problems concerning the contribution to the TRV of the supply circuit are reported."
"This paper describes the functions to be performed by a new control system designed for the operation of the generation- transmission system of the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. The primary message of this paper is to show how this control system, scheduled to be in service in late 1972, is planned to improve the security of the power system through the implementation of several innovations in the areas of security analysis, trouble analysis, automatic circuit restoration, generalized operation load flow, interconnection modelling, exact economic dispatch, man-machine interfaces and display, and operator training."
"The circular cylinder, the thick wall and the th-in wall tubes are characterized in a transient state with skin effect by three canonical schemes whose elements have constant resistances and inductances. The schemes which include parallel P, series S and chain C connected elements are independent of the modes of current excitation. They may be used in the analysis of electrical networks which contain elements with skin effect."
"The trend toward extra-high-voltage (EHV) has focused attention on acceptable audible noise levels due to corona. The Radio Noise Subcommittee whose members are intimately concerned with the audible noise problem, has consolidated the results of research and experience to present this guide on the measurement of audible noise from transmission lines."
"Audible noise measurements on a three-phase test line have been made on four conductor configurations energized at 525 kVL_ L. A statistical analysis of the resulting noise levIels is presented. In addition to being energized three phase, the test line was energized single phase and a comparison is made with single-phase laboratory test results. The noise level from a four-bundle configuration at reduced phase spacing simulating 735-kV operation is evaluated."
"The effects of different types of transmission-line noise on television reception are examined. Curves relating annoyance with measured signal-to- noise ratios are produced. Tolerability criteria are derived. Finally, the use of a TV set as noise detector for TVI measurements is introduced."
"Radio interference (noise) is generated in HVDC converter stations due to the rapid breakdown of the voltage between anodes and cathodes of the converter valves during valve ignitions. These breakdowns cause steep current pulses to be injected in the system resulting in high frequency radiation from the valves, from the equipment in the switchyard and from the outgoing lines. Factors influencing the radio interference level and means for its reduction are discussed in the paper. Interference in the frequency range from 0.1 to 10 MHz is analyzed."
"A direct method is introduced for minimizing the shift of generation required to meet temporary operating criteria, such as the elimination of overload lines or transformers, or fixed flows on inter-ties or critical lines. Also, a linear model for multiple contingencies is presented."
"Electric utilities presently use static optimization techniques to solve the economic load allocation problem. Experience has shown that a number of difficulties arise when these solutions are incorporated in the feedback control of dynamic electric power networks. This research attempts to overcome the disadvantages of such controllers by combining economic load allocation and supplementary control action into a single dynamic optimal control problem."
"In this paper, the hourly operating cost of an interconnected power system constrained by prescribed area interchanges is minimized. The scheduled area interchanges act as constraining equations in the economic optimization procedure. The hourly cost minimization is performed with respect to active and reactive generation and is subjected to constraints on voltage and power flows. This minimization is carried out under several assumptions, notably: optimum operation of some area k of the interconnected system, optimum economic operation of the whole system with the interchange constraints satisfied, and optimum operation of the whole system with the interchange constraints disregarded for increased overall economy. These three assumptions are encountered in the operation of power pools. A numerical example involving a 30-node system, real and reactive power with adjustable transformers and three areas is solved by two optimization procedures: the Penalty Function method and the Generalized Reduced Gradient. A system equivalent that includes the effect of the area interchange controllers upon the flow is developed."
"The utilization of EHV networks and underground cables in today's modern power system has created a reactive power control problem. In particular, system generators are being forced to absorb large quantities of reactive power to maintain system voltage."
"The implementation of optimal control requires the measurement of all the state variables of the system which may not always be possible in practice. Hence a method is proposed by which a suboptimal control policy of a given linear system can be obtained by making use of its simplified model whose order is always less than that of the original system. The suboptimal control policy thus obtained requires the measurement of less number of states of the system, thus simplifying the control structure."
"An optimal additive power control for an n-generator power system is developed that forces the system to move over optimal trajectories from appropriate initial states to a stable target state over finite time intervals [O, T]. This dynamic optimal control maintains system stability even if some of these initial states lie outside of the subspace of states leading to stable trajectories for the free-running system. Those initial states for which this technique generates admissible (or practical) controls constitutes a region of controllability. The technique presented in this paper first defines a set of admissible trajectories all originating in the designated initial state at time t = 0 and terminating in the stable target state at a fixed, arbitrary time t = T. A cost functional-defined on this set of trajectories is minimized through variational methods to yield an optimal fixed-time trajectory for the interval [0, T]. The fixed-time control required for this optimal trajectory is determined explicitly by means of the state equations. A second cost functional defined on the set of optimal fixed-time trajectories corresponding to all T ϵ(0,∞) is then minimized to generate an optimal free-time trajectory, control, and time interval [0, T*]. This minimization leads to admissible controls only for initial states in an appropriate region of controllability. Two-and four-machine examples are included for illustrating the technique."
"A very important aspect to be considered in the protection against secondary cable faults, by a transformer secondary breaker or internal fuse, is the rapid decay of fault-current magnitude as a function of cable resistance change with respect to time. This is particularly true where small AWG conductor, such as in service leads, is associated with large kVA size transformers. This paper intends to show that for such secondary systems, routine fault coordiantion may not be correct."
"In selecting extrudable semi-conducting polyolefins for use as conductor and insulation shields for high voltage power cables, too much emphasis is often placed on initial volume resistivity. An Engineering analysis, covering the electrical, chemical and physical requirements for these shields, reveals that a different balance of properties is desirable for each application and that volume resistivity may be of secondary importance. This paper covers the results of an extensive Laboratory investigation to determine the effects of temperature, time, materials processing, solvents, and electrical tape adhesives on nine commercially available semi-conducting materials, and five experimental variations, and offers a guide for selecting semi-conducting compounds for optimum service performance."
"Many of the corrosion problems confronting electric utility companies with submersible URD systems are similar to those encountered for the past twenty ( 20) years by Boston Edison Company in the operation of its underground distribution system which includes mild steel subway transformer tanks."
"The disruptive failure of distribution transformers is a subject of increasing concern to both manufacturers and users. This paper studies the problem as it relates to pad-mounted URD systems and suggests the use of current-limiting fuses as a possible solution. Several application considerations are also examined."
"The configuration of the underground primary system has a direct bearing on service availability. For this reason, service availability should be a dominant criterion in determining the optimum configuration for underground three-phase primary systems. This paper examines the influence of primary circuit configuration on the frequency and duration of service interruptions and on the service restoration procedure. Various arrangements of radial, open loop, and dual feed system elements are considered, with both manual and automatic sectionalizing equipment. The availability performance of a variety of total system configurations is determined by combining these system elements."
"The thermal characteristics of buried heat sources (transformers) are analyzed and evaluated. Important parameters of the soil environment are discussed. The theoretical analysis is correlated with field test data in a variety of environments. Loadability characteristics of direct-buried transformers are presented along with an analysis of ways and means of increasing loadability."
"Having made the assumption that a direct buried residential transformer was an economic necessity in unit residential installations, the next step was to determine its physical and electrical practicality. To accomplish this, it was necessary to gather engineering data. For this purpose a test installation equipped with cathodic protection and temperature test points was proposed. Installation procedures were developed to handle the field problems associated with direct burial. Methods of marking the field location were studied and the costs of converting a subsurface transformer to a direct buried unit were reviewed. Upon receiving favorable engineering data and confirmation of the anticipated economics, the direct burial concept was recognized as an acceptable approach. Now after three years of installation experience and the emergence of a direct buried transformer, methods have evolved into standards. Present installed units continue to be observed and evaluated with added interest in increased loading and multiple secondary services."
"Termination of cables has been simplified by utilizing new techniques which reduce installation time and cost through new design techniques and insulating materials."
"This presentation establishes corrosion controls for submersible vault type electric systems and includes a computerized analysis of galvanic and electrolytic conditions. Separate tests of anode configuration and of cathodic protection interference with the copper concentric neutral of a direct buried cable are discussed."
"Some of the design considerations in the development of a separable connector for primary underground systems are outlined. Typical calculations are given, with the accompanying assumptions, so that the basis for the design is known and its qualifications."
"Two different methods are presented for calculating the impedances of UD multi-wire concentric neutral circuits. In the simplified method, the concentric neutral is represented as a uniform sheath and in the detailed method each wire of the neutral maintains its identity. It is shown that both methods essentially give the same results for both single-phase and three-phase circuits. The parameters affecting the division of current between the earth return path and the concentric neutral in single-phase circuits are defined. The effects of conductor spacing, concentric neutral radius, and concentric neutral resistance on earth-neutral circulating currents in three-phase circuits are presented. For single-phase circuits, it is shown that reducing concentric neutral size reduces neutral current but may cause an increase in neutral watts-loss."
"An introduction to corrosion and cathodic protection theory leads to a discussion of this corrosion control technique as applied to direct buried transformers. Results of laboratory and field testing have provided necessary data on how to properly apply cathodic protection to direct buried distribution transformers."
"The results are presented of a computer study of the impedance of direct buried cable with current flow in the earth taken into account. The cable considered is solid insulation, concentric neutral, primary cable used for rural underground distribution. The effects of earth resistivity, line length and neutral conductivity are examined. Impedance values for 15 kV and 25 kV cable are given for sizes # 2 through #4/0 AWG."
"This paper reports the results of extensive examination of 15 kV and 22 kV polyethylene insulated cables which had been in service for periods of time ranging from less than one year to eight years. Evidence of treeing and related insulation deterioration at normal operating voltage is presented. The investigation is continuing and more data is required before conclusions can be drawn regarding the extent and severity of polyethylene insulation deterioration."
"This paper covers the 3.5 mi (5.6 km) installation by New England Power Company of a direct buried 115 kV cable, including a submarine crossing. The land and the submarine cables are of different design and were manufactured in England according to British specifications. This direct buried installation, the use of aluminum conductor and sheath, and the design to British insulation thickness offer additional economies for the underground transmission of power."
"The constantly increasing demand for electric power supply made it necessary to provide with 220 kV voltage feeding two substations in the city of Rome; the connection was obtained by an oil- filled cable-line of a total length of 22 km and conductor cross-section of-1000 to 1800 mm2."
"The presently available rules for prescribing ampacities of cables in trays have been found unduly restrictive for light to medium tray loading, leading to wide disregard of such derating for all loadings. Here is presented a method, founded on sound heat-transfer technology, and experimentally verified, for such ampacity determination. Its use should restore user confidence, with realistic ratings dependent on tray fill, and eliminate the serious consequences of tray cable overloading."
"The valve-type surge arrester with current-limiting gap has dynamic performance capabilities which provide improved protection against system transient overvoltages. This paper interprets these dynamic characteristics as revealed in laboratory tests and translates them to a set of differential equations which can be solved with the aid of a computer. Alternatively, the differential equations can serve as an important guide in developing an equivalent circuit, and hence a physical model for the arrester which might be found useful in direct analog studies. Comparison between laboratory test results and computer results establish the validity of the simulation. Extension of the approach to more general system voltage transient studies is contemplated."
"Based upon an evaluation of circuit parameters, operating voltage limits, type of construction (open-wire or spacer- cable), and distribution transformer magnetizing reactance, a method is presented for the selection of voltage ratings of distribution-type lightning arresters. This method is premised on the use of a coefficient of earthing and the abandonment of the concept of the letter classification for defining the degree of system grounding."
"When a current-limiting fuse operates to interrupt a high fault current, it must necessarily generate a high resistance quickly to provide current-limiting action. The rapid increase in resistance produces a high arc voltage across the fuse. This arc voltage will normally exceed the peak circuit voltage, with the maximum usually occurring within one millisecond after the fuse melts. At this moment, a large amount of energy may be stored in the circuit inductance. If at that instant, the fuse voltage is sufficient to spark over a lightning arrester, much of the stored energy may be dissipated by the arrester. This can produce a very severe operating duty for the arrester and in some cases cause its destruction. This paper describes the problem and touches upon the variables involved in coordinating arresters and current-limiting fuses."
"Utility corporate models have been developed to provide financial planning assistance in many utilities. This paper describes new corporate models designed specifically for assisting system planners in performing economic and financial evaluations of alternate plans. The programs described form an integrated data processing and evaluation system to produce utility corporate models for both investor-owned and government-sponsored electric utilities. The system described makes use of readily accessible data to provide forecasts of company revenues and costs. Specific data pertaining to the costs of a series of given system development plans are case input data. The system will then produce financial forecasts and automatically perform both a year-by-year comparative evaluation between plans and a present value calculation. Financial models are available for both the investor-owned utility and the semi-government type of utility corporation or commission. This commission model is useful for studying the effects of alternate capital growth policies. Examples are presented in the paper of both system expansion studies and studies of the percent of alternate policies on the capital expenditure growth to be financed out of revenues."
"This paper is concerned with the System Interconnector, a new development for preventing spread of disturbances and reducing short circuit capacity in a large-scale power system where power demand is ever increasing. Background where such development is required, functional requirements, results of analytical and experimental studies, and feasibility of practical schemes are discussed. Also described are 66kV prototypes of the System Interconnector."
"Practical experience with load-flow solutions has indicated that stable solutions are probably unique, given sufficient data about a network to determine a solution from the standpoint of dimensionality, i.e., having as many equations as variables for the remaining unknowns. A counterexample is given here for which two stable solutions exist, and an approach towards the analysis of uniqueness is presented that adds some insight into the nature of load-flow solutions in general."
"A complete and comprehensive mathematical model of phase shifting components is developed using a delta-wye transformer bank as an example of a typical phase shifting component. Linear graph theory techniques are used to form the model which is called a V-equivalent. The V-equivalent is incorporated into the network matrix called ZBUS which is then used in the short circuit equations for a line-to-ground fault. In this paper, a numerical example utilizing a sample power system is used to illustrate the method by which the V-equivalent of a delta-wye transformer bank is incorporated into a digital computer program for short circuit studies. The results of the digital computer program demonstrate that, by the use of the V- equivalent, phase shifting components such as delta-wye transformers can be made an integral part of the power system model. A single line-to-ground fault can occur on either side of the delta-wye transformer bank, and the correct values of the currents and voltages at the fault and throughout the system can be obtained directly from the solution of the system model. No subsequent calculations are necessary to correct for the effect of the phase shift."
"A general method, namely, multiconductor analysis, for studying the steady-state voltages and currents of the subconductors at any point along a transmission line is developed. The major advantage of this method lies in its capacity to take into account the distributed parameters and geometrical asymmetry of the line and any additional components. Its application is possible irrespective of the number of subconductors per phase, of the number of phases, and also of the number and type of the faults which occur in the transmission lines."
"As shown in the companion paper1, the multiconductor analysis may well solve the steady-state problems of the transmission lines. It can take into account the distributed parameters of the line with various heights to the ground, the geometrical asymmetry and also any additional components included in the chain matrix of the line."
"Equivalents for power system transformers vary, among other things, with normalization, change of taps and change of three-phase connection. Also, the 30 degree phase shift of delta-wye banks introduces an \"active\" equivalent. This variation in mathematical model tends to complicate computer programming as well as theory."
"The evaluation of the stability of a power system during a transient requires that the dynamics of the subsystems be decomposed into relative and collective motions. This decomposition must establish a distinction between synchronous and frequency equilibria. Such a decomposition is made possible by specifying a system center of angle which is defined as the inertia weighted average of all rotor angles. The angular velocity of the center of angle accurately describes the frequency of the system. An angular coordinate of each rotating element in the system can be specified relative to the center of angle. In terms of these coordinates a simple expression is obtained for the exact transient kinetic energy of the system. A transformation relating center of angle referenced variables to the usual one machine reference allows the simultaneous use of both references each where best suited."
"The flow function of a power system is the vector of node powers expressed in terms of the node angles. The Jacobian is the matrix of partial derivatives of the flow vector with respect to the angle vector. The ratio of the determinant of the Jacobian to the value which it has when the node angles are set to zero is a dimensionless stability margin which lies between one and zero (steady-state in- stability) and is easily computed from a load flow. The margin of torque is the least change in power flows that will cause instability. Maximizing the torque margin or maximizing the stability margin with a load constraint yields the optimum dispatching change to maximize security."
"A procedure for locating directly the lowest saddle point of the potential energy function associated with a power transmission network is presented. This procedure is used to compute a margin of stability that specifies the maximum asynchronous transient energy that can be retained by the system while in synchronism. The potential function is shown to be convex in the principal region of the angle space. A unique solution is shown to exist for the load flow problem if the algorithm of solution is initiated at the origin."
"This paper explores the feasibility of rapid a- stability analysis of electric power systems containing as many as 60 generators by using Liapunov functions. Many Liapunov functions, approximate integrals, and critical value equations are presented, some for the first time. The results of applying these functions with the aid of a CDC 6600 digital computer to electric ric power systems whose number of generators is 4, 10, 20, or 60 are given for both the computation time and result accuracy. Recommendations are made for additional research on the development of more accurate ate functions for el'ectric power system analysis."
"The paper presents the general dynamic evaluation problem of an Electric Power System under computer control. The philosophy and design techniques of a state-of-the-art digital load- frequency controller are outlined. Dynamic control criteria which will allow performance evaluation of this class of control are defined. Techniques of applying these criteria are presented, along with consideration of man-machine requirements for their evaluation. A trend recording technique suitable for performance evaluation with a control computer is described. Finally, simulation results and field test data are presented to illustrate dynamic performance evaluation of a controlled system."
"For an optimal linear regulator design a performance function of the quadratic form must be chosen. The question arises of how to decide the weighting matrix Q of the performance function. A new method is developed in this paper to determine Q in conjunction with a left shift of the dominant eigenvalues as far as the practical controllers permit. The method is then applied to the optimal control design of a typical power system. Three cases are investigated, the first with an optimal excitation control uE, the second with optimal governor controls uG and uG, with and without the dash-pot, and the third with uE plus uG control. The stabilizing signals thus obtained are given nonlinear tests on the same power system. It is found from the results that the optimal controls are more effective than conventional excitation control, that the optimal governor control without dash-pot is just as good as the optimal excitation control, and that the optimal uE plus uG control is the best way to stabilize a power system."
"The optimal linear regulator design technique of determining the weighting matrix Q with dominant eigenvalue shift, developed in a companion paper[6], is applied to the optimal stabilization of a multi- machine system. Two cases are studied, the first is with one optimal controller uE1 on one machine of the m-machine system and the other with m optimal controllers uEM for the m-machine system. For comparison arison a one optimal controller uE on one machine with the rest approximated as an infinite system and m optimal controllers of individual idual design are also investigated. Nonlinear tests are given. It is found that uEI control is better than uE control, uEM control is better still than UEI control, and individual uE controllers are not good for the overall system."
"The paper describes a Static Polyphase distance relaying scheme responding correctly to all Single line-to-ground faults and all doible-phase faults, with or without ground, by the phase-comparison of line-to-neutral compensated fault point voltages. It has been shown that if any two, out of the three, phase voltages at the fault point derived at the relaying point, are fed to a 90°phase comparator, then such a polyphase distance relay will operate correctly for all types of faults, except in one case of single line-to-ground fault, in one case of double phase-to-ground fault, and also in case of three-phase fault. To cater for all types of faults, a scheme has been proposed by the authors, which utilises four 90°transient free phase comparators based on block average phase-comparison principle. Out of these four comparators one is meant for catering three-phase fault and the remaining ng three respond correctly for all single line-o- ground and all double- phase faults, with or without ground. The outputs from the four units, are fed to a logic 'OR' gate which initiates tripping. Theoretical performance ormance characteristics of this relaying scheme during different types of faults have been explained by a generalised theory of 2-input phase comparator. Experimental verification on a laboratory model shows that the scheme is feasible and may be adopted in practice."
"Results of a survey on protective relaying testing practices are presented. The responses of 125 relay engineers to questions on the qualifications, training, and work scope of test personnel, testing equipment, nt, testing practices, test intervals, transformer fault pressure relay practices, circuit breaker trip tests, and performance checks are listed."
"Fast operation of high voltage circuit breakers has been achieved in recent years by electromagnetically driven mechanisms. Technical design and operational data must be available with manufacturers acturers of such circuit breakers. However, a detailed analysis of such a mechanism has not been published so far. In this paper the authors analyse the electromechanical behaviour of a model fast-acting circuit breaker mechanism. Numerical design techniques are also developed. Part I deals with the electrical aspects, while mechanical and thermal aspects are discussed in an accompanying paper (Part II)."
"In an accompanying paper the authors have already presented ented an analysis of certain electrical aspects of a model elecneticallyromag- etically driven circuit breaker mechanism. Similar mechanisms have been used in recent years to develop fast acting high voltage circuit breakers. This paper presents an analysis of important thermal and mechanical design parameters. Classical concepts of mechanics and heat, with appropriate numerical techniques, are utilised in the analysis presented here."
"When an electrical contact is put into service, it is of importance to predict its probable length of life with respect to its operating temperature."
"The ac current interruption ability of a vacuum switch has been examined and found to be a function of parameters which pertain to the electrodes contained in the switch and to the circuit to which the switch is connected. The dielectric recovery data for switched-off vacuum arcs are converted into a form that is applicable for determining the theoretical current interruption limit. Generalized plots of theoretical al current interruption limit versus the reciprocal of the RRRV of the circuit are given for switches having butt-type Cu or Ag electrodes. The current interruption limit of two different sizes of vacuum switches is calculated and checked against experimental test results."
"Discharge phenomena resulting from switching impulses superimposed on ac voltages have been studied on typical transformer insulation configurations and on full-scale winding. A modified test procedure for power transformers is proposed on the basis of experimental ental results."
"An experimental general-purpose process-control digital computer system provides high-speed phase-and ground-distance fault protection of one 230 kV transmission line. The stored program performs all of the relaying functions using the output of an analog-to- digital converter which reads the instantaneous value of the power- system currents and voltages. Model line tests described in a companion paper (II -Test Results) form the basis for preliminary performance evaluation. An automatic oscillograph and diagnostic programs will allow a study of field performance."

"The principles of a method of transformer protection by digital computer are described. The method is essentially an adaptation ion of harmonic-restraint differential protection."
"One transformer of a 1000-MVA 525/241.5-kV 60-Hz Y-connected bank of autotransformers, left connected to a 19-mi (30.5-km) 525-kV line but otherwise disconnected from the power system, was overheated after operating for nine minutes in ferroresonance sustained by capacitive coupling to a parallel, energized, 525-kV line. It was later untanked, tested and inspected, and no damage was found. However, to prevent recurrence of ferroresonance, the bank was modified to permit a set of existing 34.5-kV windings to be connected in delta. In similar situations where a Y-connected bank without tertiary windings is switched together with a 525-kV line paralleled by another 525-kV line, it was decided to disconnect the transformer from the line promptly after each de-energization of the transformer."
"Bonneville Power Administration' s instrumentation ion techniques for the Low Voltage Impulse method of detecting physical internal changes in transformers is presented. The potential use of the method for locating that movement is also discussed."

A proposal for definition and a test code for demonstration of short circuit strength are presented together with discussion developed from suggestions from the IEEE Transformers Committee. As these items are further developed, they will be presented as proposed revisions to ANSI Standards C57.12.00 and C57.12.90."

 "This paper describes studies of the effects of conducting particles on breakdown phenomena in compressed SF6 under alternating voltage conditions. Results with free particles of different shapes and materials are compared with those obtained with fixed particles for both parallel-plane and coaxial electrode geometrics. Calculations of the particle motion and of the energy in microdischarges between particle and electrodes are used to suggest mechanisms by which breakdown is initiated. It is shown that the breakdown voltage, which can be as low as 10% of the uncontaminated value, is markedly dependent on particle shape, size and material, and that the nature of the motion in alternating fields is important in establishing conditions for free- particle-triggered breakdown."
"Since various phenomena resulting from earth faults in pipe-type cables have not yet been sufficiently clarified, the authors made fault tests on pipes of 105 and 254 mm in diameter and 20 to 60 m in length. As a result, arc voltages were found to be nearly constant, independent of the magnitude of fault current. Moreover, the mechanism of transient pressure rise and the relation between arc energy and oil pressure rise were elucidated. Calculated results agreed fairly well with experimental data."
"In the previous paper [1], the mechanism of transient pressure rise at the faults in oil-filled pipe-type cables was discussed in detail, and the relations between arc power and pressure rise were analyzed. This paper deals with the transient pressure rise in accessories such as semi-stop joints, normal joints, and trefoil boxes."
"A new type of deterioration involving sulfide attack was discovered in a thermoplastic polyethylene insulated control cable installed in a chemical plant."
"As a result of these investigations it was observed that under certain conditions the degradation of crosslinked polyethylene (XLP) cable due to moisture was accelerated by a continuously applied ac stress as compared to dc or the absence of voltage. Further, the course of the involved activity was believed to take place in three stages. The first was the appearance of tree like channels which were filled with water, second their subsequent growth, and third their ultimate bridge between the inner and outer cable electrodes. Conventional insulation resistance measurements failed to reveal or explain these stages."
"A predictor-corrector algorithm is developed for the solution of the differential equations of transient stability studies. The algorithm uses the Hamming predictor-corrector method with some alterations, introduced to make it more suitable for the power system transient stability equations. An elementary power system, consisting of one synchronous machine, represented by 9 differential equations, connected to an infinite bus-bar by a double circuit transmission line, is used to test the proposed algorithm."
"The dynamic performance of electric power systems during disturbances is a function of many factors. The effect of these factors vary with the nature and configuration of the electrical system and is complicated due to the interrelated, and sometimes compounding effect of the automatic control equipment which makes up a system. The post-event evaluation of a dynamic system condition requires automatic and instantaneous recording of many system quantities which will show initial conditions, the transient period, the dynamic period, and the steady state or final result of all contributing factors. The instrumentation required to monitor the influence of various system quantities must provide precise records even though separated by great distances and must continue to perform accurately regardless of wide variations in voltage, current or frequency."
"This paper presents the impedance and admittance forms of diakoptic solution of the load-flow problem on the basis of graph- theoretic concepts. The formulation does not assume a fixed slack bus voltage but instead takes into account the equation for total transmission line losses as an integral part of the scheme. Finally, test data based on this alternative formulation are presented for purposes of comparison With existing methods."
"This paper presents a new method for piecewise solution of large and integrated electrical networks and power system load flow problems applying principle of superposition, without involving diakoptics. This permits an average engineer to solve his large scale practical problems in pieces without having knowledge of terminology, topology and diakoptics. The method does not require development of intersubdivision matrix (model) as required in diakoptical method on the contrary calculates cut branch currents in a simple way. Necessary mathematical models are developed which represent the performance characteristics of the system. Subdivision solution models are developed in the form of nodal admittance matrix and solved in conjunction with optimally ordered triangular factorization to yield nodal voltages. The method provides full freedom in choosing the line of cut and reference node."
"An efficient computer program which permits rapid calculations for solving a large sparse system of linear equations, which arise in most power system network problems, is described here. This procedure will have an application to any system having a similar admittance matrix to the power system, such as a weather prediction or transportation system. The basic powerful tool-direct hash technique-is used to store the nonzero elements of the sparse matrix. The two main features, triangular factorization of the given sparse matrix and use of this factored form to find the direct solution to the system, are used to estimate a post-transient steady state of a power system. Updating the node admittance matrix after a change in the system structure is also performed in factored matrix form. In both factoring the Jacobian and in changing the the system structure, the introduction of additional non-zero terms in a sparse matrix is easily handled without prior knoledge of the new locations."
"The non-linear programming problem of short term optimal operation in a mixed hydro-thermal power system is considered in this paper in terms of real, reactive and real and reactive power optimization. The concepts developed for each of these three cases are illustrated by application to a reduced model of the Saskatchewan Power Corporation System. The results clearly show the benefits associated with real and reactive power optimization in a system of this type."
"Decomposition algorithms are proposed in the literature to compute the optimal schedule of integrated hydro-thermal power systems. Such an algorithm in conjunction with successive solutions of optimal load flows and of the hydro subsystem is presented in [1]. However, the specific computation of a schedule for a hydro system, which takes into account hydro dynamics with variable water heads, cascaded plants, by-pass discharges, spilling, pump storage plants, and navigation requirements, is still to be presented. The present paper covers a possible procedure to compute the optimal schedule for such hydro systems."
"A group of papersl presented at the 1970 Winter Power Meeting outlined the EEI-Manufacturer's 500/550 KV Cable Research Project, at the Waltz Mill Testing Facility, under the direction of the Electric Research Council. A description of the station layout and voltage supply was given in the lead paper2 of that series and need not be repeated here."

S."
"This paper covers General Cable Corporation's research, development and qualification testing of a 138 kV cable having extruded cross-linked polyethylene insulation. Also discussed is the manufacture, factory testing and installation of a length of this cable at the Edison Electric Institute test site at Waltz Mill, Pennsylvania. The accelerated life tests being performed at Waltz Mill will serve to evaluate and establish the performance of 138 kV cross-linked polyethylene insulated power cable designed and manufactured in accord with current technology."
"This paper covers the General Electric Company's development, testing and installation at the Waltz Mill Station of a 138 kV solid dielectric power cable and associated splice. The cable described is unique in the industry in that (1) it utilizes a new insulation with higher breakdown strength, (2) is the only cable at Waltz Mill to use a mineral filled cross- linked polyethylene, and (3) has its insulation shield intimately bonded to the insulation."
"The Electric Research Council published rigid specifications for cable supplierswho wished to participate in the Waltz Mill program for Solid Dielectric Cables. This paper deals with problems encountered during the conduct of the qualification tests, and the solutions to these problems. Designs of the 138 kV cable and splice are discussed along with test data which show these basic electrical and thermal characteristics. The paper includes sections dealing with terminators and connectors. Finally, the author reviews the installation at the test site and compares preliminary test data obtained there with the test data observed in the laboratory."
"This paper presents a thorough laboratory evaluation of cable design, construction and accessories for 138 kV operation. The work was done as part of the EEI sponsored Waltz Mill project for solid dielectrics. With the increasing use of these cables at higher voltages, it was necessary that complete cable circuits be properly evaluated to determine performance. The testing program disclosed several major problems which, when identified, led to improvement in both material and technique. Of special significance was the development of a system which controlled and recorded conductor temperature."
"The development of a flexible, ethylene-propylene base insulated cable by The Okonite Company for 138 kV underground systems is reported up to the actual test installation at Waltz Mill. This paper describes the design development and prototype work, the successful qualification testing of the ultimate cable construction, and the development and qualification testing of a simplified vulcanized splice."
"We have developed a type of ac commutatorless motor which is a combination of a motor and thyristor controller. The rotor of the motor has neither a commutator, slip rings nor brushes. The motor can therefore be designed rugged for a high speed control. The motor may be most suitable for use in such an environment as with acid or alkaline gas and at locations where maintenance-free motors are most urgently required."
"The brushless dc motor described in this article is composed of six thyristors and of a single synchronous motor with an auxiliary position sensor. On the field poles of this motor compensating windings are provided. These windings are connected in series with dc supply as is the case with a dc motor. However, in the motor described in this article the commutation is performed by the armature induced voltage, therefore commutating devices such as capacitors, reactors and auxiliary thyristors are not required."
"This paper describes the application of a modem data acquisition system to the measurement of induction machine characteristics and the use of digital techniques for the identification of circuit parameters from this data. Direct analytical methods of data reduction are compared with parameter optimizing techniques."
"The paper deals with the analysis of field harmonics in an asynchronous machine. It is proved that with increasing saturation of the magnetic circuit, the influence of the higher space harmonics on the field form is reduced. This causes reduction of the parasitic torques. Results of theoretical calculations have been compared with measurements of synchronous and asynchronous parasitic torques, which have been obtained for different supply voltages of the motor; satisfactory accordance is shown to exist."
"A short stator (stationary stator) linear induction motor is developed which possesses an extra long rotor stroke with only a minimum requirement of rotor core."
"This paper deals with the determination of slot dimensions in double squirrel-cage and deep-bar rotors of a three phase induction motor. For a designed stator, the slot dimensions can be determined from the starting torque, starting current (or breakdown torque) and nominal slip."
"A new type of single-phase alternating current motor that produces constant torque for any operating speed is described. The magnitude of the torque is adjustable. When rotation is in the direction of the developed torque motor action results. With reversed rotation the machine performs as a generator without change of the magnitude or direction of its developed torque. Efficiencies are comparable to those of conventional motors of equivalent ratings. No electronic devices or moving parts are required in the supply system. Sinusoidal voltages and currents prevail throughout the supply system and the motor components."
"The theory of the constant-torque motor has been extended and presented herewith along with new circuits and experimental data showing the characteristics of a monocyclic single-phase motor. In some of the systems described the field windings of the motor serve a dual purpose of (a) supplying the field flux (b) providing the inductive reactances of a monocyclic system which delivers a constant current to the armature. While the motor thus connected cannot be defined accurately as a constant-torque drive, it provides only small variations in torque with changes in speed. For many applications (such as windings of tape, wire, thread, etc.) it would be as suitable as the constant-torque motor. Other systems described, show circuits that provide a constancy of torque. The theory presented is supported by illustrative phasor diagrams and test results."

"Stability criteria for reluctance motors are derived in terms of machine parameters, voltage, applied frequency, inertia, etc. Simplified equations are found that enable physical interpretation of the causes of instability."
"A new type reluctance motor which is inherently stable and has improved performance is described. The performance is compared with older type reluctance motors."
"The limits of stability in reluctance machines are known to be narrow, especially in machines of improved design with high reactance ratio. These stability limits can usefully be investigated with the aid of computed and measured freely accelerating torque speed curves. The machine equations are developed using a frame of reference fixed with respeot to the rotor. Machine performance is then simulated on an analogue computer. A large number of freely accelerating torque speed curves are then generated for different values of machine parameters. The model is designed to cope simply with different motors and is based on a per unit system. All parameters can be simply varied, so that their effect on performance can be demonstrated . The torque speed curves that result can be said to be characteristic. of amachine with given parameters and contain information about starting torque, transient torque dips, synchronisation ability and stability. Since changes in parameters cause marked changes in shape of the freely accelerating torque speed curve, it is possible, by matching the results obtained from a practical test with those from a computer study, to determine where the total performance of the machine lies with respect to the optimum and to decide what changes are necessary to improve design."
"The paper describes the design of reluctance motors having unlaminated rotors and gives test results for a range of motors which demonstrate the very satisfactory levels of performance which have been attained. Two types of design are described having, respectively, salient-pole rotors and rotors with flux barriers. The theoretical basis of their design is presented and is substantiated by the exprimental work. A particularly notable result is that good synchronising performance is obtained, without using embedded squirrel-cage windings, by incorporating either simple low-resistance sections in the rotor or by machining narrow axial slits in the rotor surface."
"The commutation principle for HVDC circuit breakers is described whereby the current in the circuit is brought to zero by a bucking current from a precharged capacitor. Circuit features are described to render this procedure easier for the interrupter and typical component requirements are discussed. The functions of current interruption and energy absorption should be separated; to this end, one type of surge suppressor is described. With breakers of this type, multi-terminal HVDC systems could be operated much like comparable AC systems, with only minimal dependence on terminal controls. A tapped line is given as an example."
"The effectiveness of the commutation principle, using vacuum interrupters as a means for interrupting high direct current at high voltage, has been demonstrated convincingly by a large number of tests. Currents in excess of 15 kA at 20 kV have been interrupted by a single device in an inductive circuit. Tests are reported in which higher current were cleared by paralleling interrupters. Interrupters have been tested in series, indicating that the principle can be extended to high voltages. A high speed mechanism is described which was designed specifically for circuit breakers of this type. The necessary technology for producing HVDC circuit breakers appears to be at hand."
"Vacuum has special properties which make it a potentially good insulating medium for the power industry but high voltage 60 Hz performance data is lacking. Experimental data is presented on the 60-Hz behaviour of vacuum insulation for gap lengths 0.5 to 2.0 cm between metal electrodes in a dynamically pumped system operating at 10-6 torr. The results are compared with the dc characteristics of vacuum insulation for similar test conditions. Prebreakdown phenomena and protrusion formations under 60 Hz voltage stress appear to be distinctly different. Specific recommendations are set out to guide further research effort, and to meet the particular requirements of vacuum insulation for high voltage power apparatus."
"So-called uniform field discharge data for SF6 may be subject to errors caused by the effect of the inherent nonuniformity of the test gap. It is shown that uniform field pre-breakdown measurements of ionization and attachment coefficients in SF6 require pd values below a few hundred mmHg cm, and that pd must be less than a few thousand mmHg cm to obtain proper uniform field breakdown voltages."
"In this paper, a new consideration in the application of horn gap switches for interrupting distribution circuits fed from two different sources is proposed. Equations for determining the average arc reach are derived using the experimental work reported in Ref. 1."
"The Waltz Mill Project, performing accelerated life testing of prototype samples of 115-kV to 750-kV, is part of the Electric Research Council's underground transmission system research program. Waltz Mill also serves as a prototype of 1100-kV overhead type substations. This paper describes the design and testing of 1100-kV disconnect switches for application at Waltz Mill and on future systems."
"Axial currents of power frequency flowing in filaments of infinite length parallel to a cylindrical shell of one cylindrical boundary and finite length give rise to eddy currents due to proximity effect. As a first case, a hole in a conducting material is considered between two parallel planes with the current filament placed at the axis of the hole. The distribution of the proximity effect current is determined analytically in this case by solving the differential equation for penetration of currents in the conducting material and appropriately applying boundary conditions. The conducting material is non-magnetic."
"Axial currents of power frequency flowing in filaments of infinite length parallel to a cylindrical shell of finite length and of one cylindrical boundary give rise to eddy currents in the conducting material of the shell due to proximity effect. The shell considered, consists of a cylindrical hole in a conducting material between two parallel planes. The current filament is placed inside the hole at an arbitrary but known position. The distribution of the proximity effect is determined analytically by solving the differential equation for penetration of currents and appropriately applying boundary conditions. The loss is also determined. The material of the shell is considered to be non- magnetic."
"As steam turbine generator units increase in rating, their inertia constants tend to decrease and their reactance constants to increase, thus aggravating the power system transient stability problem. There is also a tendency for the complete unit to take longer to restart and re load when unschedu led disconnection from the system takes place. Counter measures are needed and may be available within the power plant. A study of these measures was made by the authors acting as a Working Group of NewEngland's NEPLAN Planning Committee's System Design Task Force. The paper presents the Working Group's findings as widely supported by the major utilities in New England."
"This paper endeavors to model the effects of governor- turbine dynamics on the average system frequency behavior of a multi- generator system after a major generation loss or load change when the system remains in synchronism. The maximum frequency deviation and the time at which the maximum occurs are the main quantities of interest. Two independent concepts are presented to convert a closed-loop, high dimensional, nonlinear model into approximate, open-loop, low dimensional, linear ones (the delay and the canonical models). The delay model uses pure time delay to model \"fast time constants\" and valve motion and converts the closed loop model into an open loop one. The canonical model expresses the turbine reheats respo'nse as a linear combination of a set of \"basis\" functions and provides a basis for combining many machines into one simplified, low dimensional model. The two models can be implemented concurrently, to give a very large reduction in complexity when a multi-machine system is analyzed."
"Techniques are described for improving the speed of large transient stability studies without sacrificing accuracy. A fast iterative method for solving the algebraic network equations, including the effect of generator saliency, is explained. A new technique for solving the differential equations with the implicit trapezoidal rule of integration is introduced. These two techniques can be combined into one simultaneous solution, thereby eliminating the problem of interface error between the differential and algebraic equation solutions of the traditional approach."
"An electrogeometric model is utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of overhead skywire and tower networks in shielding substation equipment from direct lightning strokes. Monte Carlo techniques are used to simulate the service performance of shielding designs. An evaluation of the sensitivity of the technique to uncertainties in the design parameters is made."
"The authors have considered a typical radial distribution substation which is being fed by a single high tension feeder and have shown that individual circuit breakers associated with different outgoing distributors can be totally dispensed with by the use of two suitably placed autoreclosing circuit breakers. This economisation has been achieved at the cost of interruptions of supply either in all or in half of the distributors for a very short duration, which may be tolerated in most of the cases of rural areas, for faults in any distributor. Different logical and switching schemes to be used have been developed by writing different constrained equations, and then solving them with the help of boolean algebra. Semi-conductor switching, counting and logic circuits have been used to control the sequential and interlocked mode of operations for the two circuit breakers and isolators. Provision has been made to isolate each C.B. from supply for maintenance and repair work during which period the other C.B. will maintain the continuity of entire supply."
"This paper describes an engineering analysis procedure for predicting the commutation process in a d-c machine. It emphasizes a simplified computational procedure through the use of iteration techniques, disciplined conventions and procedures, and field analysis technique. The bar-to-brush contact resistance has been found to play an important role in the analysis. Calculated values are compared to experimental results."
"A low-speed polyphase motor is developed. The stator windings are designed, for simultaneously producing two different pole numbers in the air gap. The permeance distributed rotor interacts with one of the stator flelds and during the process generates the second one. The latter reacts with its stator counterpart, resulting in torque production."
"The performance of polyphase induction machine with hollow ferro-magnetic rotor is presented here for the first time on the basis of a definite value of the magnetising force existing on the inner surface of the rotor, this value increasing as wall thickness decreases."
"Magnetic web of a hollow rotor induction machine leads to an improvement in performance. An analysis based on field theory attempted here brings out this aspect and also accounts satisfactorily for (i) Saturation, (ii) rotor wall thicknesses and (iii) end termination. Comparison with test results shows good agreement."
"In this paper, the second method of Liapunov is used to investigate the dynamic stability problem of power systems using the perturbed system dynamics in state variable form. Defining stability measure in terms of Liapunov functions and their time derivatives, the paper formulates a method for the calculation of the sensitivity of the dynamic stability measure to variations in various machine and control system parameters. The method provides a basis for optimal dynamic stability design of power systems, the criterion of optimality being that the sensitivity of the dynamic stability measure to parameter variations be zero. For simplicity, the case of a synchronous machine connected to an infinite bus is considered. The effect of various voltage regulator parameters on the sensitivity of the dynamic stability measure is investigated. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the superiority of the time response resulting from the choice of parameter settings corresponding to zero sensitivity of the dynamic stability measure. The method is readily generalized to the case of multi- machine power systems."
"The paper explains two new theories of the linear induction motor, and indicates that the end effect exercises very adverse influence on motor performances, and proposes the compensated linear induction motor as a measure to eliminate. the end effect."
"A single-phase, alternating current motor system is presented wherein the motor components form part of the control system to provide constant-torque regardless of speed changes and also provide a means for adjusting the magnitude of torque over a wide range of values--each adjustment resulting in a fixed torque for all of its associated speeds. This is accomplished by maintaining a constant field flux for all operating speeds and by maintaining an armature current having a component that is in time phase with the field flux. This component of the armature current is constant for each adjustment thereby providing a constant torque. The armature current is obtained by connecting one side of the armature circuit to a mid tap of the motor field winding and the other side to the junction of an inductor and a capacitor connected in series to the same voltage that supplies the field winding. Control of the torque of the motor is achieved by adjustment of the magnitude of the ohmic values, and the ratio of the capacitance reactance to the inductive reactance."

"This report was prepared as an activity of the Working Group* of the Capacitor subcommittee of the IEEE Committee on Transmission and Distribution, to extend the existing bibliographies through the years 1967-1970. A total of 208 articles are referenced and classified, which includes both shunt and series capacitors, relative to economics, designs and applications. Many foreign language papers are listed.

It includes the design of a prototype frequency-modulated fault location system. Test results of this system operating on a simulated transmission line are also included."
"The relationships between \"remaining strength\", time and temperature for conductors operated at elevated temperatures are presented as empirical models based on elevated temperature test results. The comparison between the remaining strength predicted from the models and the measured remaining strength is shown. Use of the models is explained and examples of their use are presented."
"The development of a new electrical machines laboratory is discussed. The objectives and the underlying philosophy for achieving a physical understanding of machines are stated. The fractional-horsepower-size equipment newly developed and some typical experiments are described."
"A generalized form of the conventional polyphase symmetrical component transformation is proposed. This includes time dependent phase shifts. It is applied directly to the dynamical equations of a polyphase induction machine and it is shown that the system differential equations are greatly simplified by appropriate choice of the phase shift functions. The physical meaning of the sequence components is explained in terms of machine mmf and flux harmonics."
"Even harmonics of mmf are produced whenever the excitations on the separate poles of a winding are unequal as in some starting connections used in single phase motors or in certain consequent pole windings. The analytical methods developed in this paper are applicable to any three-winding squirrel cage induction machine with arbitrary mmf distribution in all three windings. A center-tapped main winding single phase motor is used as an example and the reduction in performance caused by even harmonics is shown both analytically and experimentally. The theory is applicable to both steady state and dynamic performance and illustrative results for the transient performance of the sample motor are included. Application of the method to three phase machines is discussed."
"In the transient analysis of salient pole alternators, the reactances X'd and X'q are assumed to be constants. In saturated machines, however, these reactances are functions of the pre-transient load of the alternator. For more exact analyses saturated reactances should be used. The expression of rotor quantities in stator terms, or vice versa, at nonlinear condition is explained. The operational impedances Xd(p), Xq(p) and the various time constants of alternators without amortisseur windings are developed from leakage reactance concepts. After a first approximation of the transient reactances is obtained from the operational impedances, a step-by-step correction procedure is used for finding the operationally dependent direct transient reactance. This is obtained from a simulated dynamical test. Only a few step-by-step corrections are necessary to yield good values for the transient reactances. Since there is a slight difference between Xq and X'q, the analysis will concentrate only to X'd. Notations not explained here are the same as in Concordia [1]. The analysis is applied to a General Electric alternator with nameplate data 82.5 MVA, 16.5 kV, wye-connected, 40 poles and 60 Hz, described in [2]."
"Published methods of calculating induction motors do not reflect the effect of skew on the magnetic field in the air gap. The rotor bar current as affected by skew alters the total mutual field. This paper determines the voltages induced in both the rotor bar and the primary winding as affected by the said modified field and provides equations to calculate its effect on performance. This paper also analyzes the field resulting from non-skewed stator conductors carrying line current and skewed rotor conductors carrying rotor bar current. Rotor current is calculated in terms of individual bar currents; present techniques use uniform current sheet distribution. Equations are given to calculate motor performance reflecting the effect of skew on the mutual field."
"Experimental results obtained from the tests made on a three-phase induction motor with different solidiron as well as composite rotors are presented in this paper. These are compared with the theoretical predicted characteristics based on existing analytical as well as numerical analyses. The limitations in applying different theories for prediction of performance are discussed."
"A new equivalent circuit is given to simulate the slot impedance of a T-shaped conductor with idle-bar. Calculations are included for the evaluation of slot impedance with single-rectangular conductor, single rectangular conductor with idle-bar, T-shaped conductor and T-shaped conductor with idle-bar respectively. Good agreement was obtained with measured results."
"A technique is described that permits the determination of the amount of power which can be imported from (or exported to) neighboring companies, without overloading \"limiting\" lines during an emergency situation, when certain \"key\" lines are out of service. The method is a multiple contingency extention of a technique described earlier.[1] The advantage of the method is the reduction in computer running time, as compared to the time required to obtain the equivalent information by complete power flow solutions, for the several conditions to be studied. The program has been extensively used with good success.[2]"
"A functional analytic optimization technique is applied to the Problem of optimum scheduling of hydro-thermal power systems. The power system considered contains two hydro-plants on the same stream. The time delay of flow between upstream and downstream plants is taken into consideration. The problem is formulated as an abstract minimum norm problem. The optimal solution found here satisfies the necessary conditions of variational calculus for control problems with delayed arguments. A generalized contraction mapping technique is applied to a sample system to illustrate the results obtained."
"Generalized relations for generator excitation power requirements are given for steady-state excitation, transient field forcing, and power damping operations. These relations give the excitation power in per-unit, on the generator MVA base, as a function of the generator per-unit reactances and field time constant. The effect upon power damping of drawing the required excitation power from the main generator shaft is also investigated. It is found that, in general, the effect of powering the exciter from the main generator is to reduce the amount of damping that can be provided by excitation control. However, in the case of a topical conventional generator, the resultant reduction in damping is usually so slight (about 2%) as to be negligible."
"This paper shows how brushless thyristor excitation systems for large synchronous generators are being evolved in the authors' organisation, outlines the electrical and mechanical advantages that accrue, and includes some results of a digital computer comparison of such systems with other forms of excitation."
"This paper presents a method of analyzing hysteresis motors for their parameters, gross power, losses and magnetizing ampere turns. A method is shown for calculating performance from either calculated or tested parameters. A synthesis method is given for determining rotor ring thickness."
"The introduction of seismic design criteria into specifications for nuclear power plant equipment has significantly complicated the role of the electrical equipment manufacturer. The intent of this paper is to explain a few of the basic concepts utilized in earthquake analysis and to illustrate how the seismic design criteria can be satisfied."
"Direct-on-line starting of the polyphase induction motor coupled to a mechanically resonant load is studied by numerical integration of the nonlinear system equations and is shown to be capable of generating excessively large electromechanical torque peaks during transients. This study is supplemented by the modal approach which identifies the causes to be: (1) the excitation of the line frequency oscillating transient torque component which arises from the interaction of the line currents and the dominant mode currents and, (2) the possibility of mechanical amplification of this oscillating torque component when the resonant frequency of the shaft is close to the line frequency."
"This paper describes unique features of the electrical equipment and some of the considerations involved in its selection for a 1,700-MVA underground pumped-storage project with four reversible pump/turbines. Considerations of cost and maintenance of the machines, transmission system, and powerhouse construction led to selection of generator/motors with direct water-cooled stator and rotor windings, static-converter synchronous starting of pumps with synchronous dynamic braking, use of generator circuit breakers, and underground main transformers with self-contained 161-kV single-section cables having 1,100-ft change in elevation."
"An experimental study of transient current density distribution within a nonlinear conductor is presented. The study was performed by applying impulse currents to a model of the conductor. A new measuring method was developed which permits the recording of current density at chosen points within the conductor model. The method was verified on a linear conductor model and a compatible agreement between the measured and calculated results was obtained."
"Measurements of power-system three-phase transformer resonant frequencies under fault conditions are analyzed and related to the transient recovery voltage appearing across a fault-interrupting device. Frequencies and time-to-peak values are derived that can be used to establish test standards for interrupting devices."
"A turn-to-turn fault of a high-voltage motor which was controlled by a vacuum contactor prompted this study. The study revealed that a voltage escalation can certainly occur by the repetition of re-ignitions as indicated by recent several papers,1,2, but the cause of the escalation is different from that reported. This paper presents a new theory for the voltage escalation, makes clear the conditions for the occurrence of the escalation, and leads to the conclusion that protectors are indispensable in the application of the contactors to the motor control circuit."
"This bibliography was prepared for the IEEE Education, Recognition and Planning Subcommittee of the IEEE Switchgear Committee to be used as a reference for switchgear education. The references essentially cover the period of time from 1958 through 1968 with a few papers preceding this period. The last complete bibliography appeared in the AIEE Transactions, Vol. 61, pp. 1077-1100, 1942. It is expected that these references will be updated on a regular basis hereafter."
"Since the incremental power demand in a power system is not always apriori known, direct application of the optimum linear- state regulator to load-frequency control is not possible. Furthermore, load-frequency control generally requires the use of an integral type control operation to meet the system operating specifications. This requirement is introduced into the formulation of the optimum load- frequency control problem presented in this paper."
"A method is given for solving, suboptimally, the problem of optimum-load frequency sampled-data control with either unknown deterministic power demand or randomly varying system disturbances. It is shown how to modify an optimum continuous control to obtain optimum control in the case of discrete-data transmission and unknown deterministic demand."
"During the past several years, considerable test data on the switching surge strength characteristics of air gaps with various electrode configurations has been reported by many investigators. This paper reports on a comparative study of the data in the EHV system voltage ratings of 345, 500, and 765 kV. The approach to the final recommendations recognizes the extreme expense necessary for thorough and complete testing of all electrode configurations which might occur in substation designs. Consequently, an effort has been made to generalize these variables and to provide data which will satisfy the most severe case."
"In our previous paper*1 we reported our fundamental study and, to some extent, application to cables of the semiconductive organic liquid which, when mixed in cross- linked polyethylene insulation for cable, deposits on the surfaces of voids in the insulation or between the insulation and the semiconductive layer with the lapse of time and brings about a remarkable reduction in surface restivity there, thus weakening the electric field within voids and eliminating partial discharges. Furthermore, the voltage- time characteristic curve of the cable with such insulation is more horizontal as compared with that of conventional crosslinked polyethylene insulated cable. We have since continued our study on such semiconductive organic liquid inthe process of its application to cable insulationandfound many phenomena. According to our findings, the breakdown voltage is less affected adversely by defects in the insulation and therefore is stable with very little deviation. The cable insulation containing the semiconductive organic liquid has a higher impules breakdown voltage and is free from breakdown at low voltages."
"The proposed transient recovery voltage standard for high voltage circuit breakers will specify application requirements on a recovery voltage basis. This paper studies the inherent circuit parameters required to generate the required TRV envelope. A simplified application procedure is developed based on miles to the first line discontinuity and the number of lines connected on the bus side of the circuit breaker."
"A further study of the responses of the IEEE questionnaire(1) regarding the various aspects of the problem of insulator contamination was made according to the general geographic and climatic area. Interesting information was revealed about the distribution of reported outages in the United States and Canada. It was found that problems either occur over a large region or are confined to a more or less well-defined spot. Hence, in the two countries surveyed, a differentiation was made between regioanl and spot contamination, though the latter type is not complete. The performance of transmission system insulation in various geographic regions has been analyzed regarding the effects of contamination. Industrial pollution seems to have more serious effects than the geographically more outspread natural contamination."
"In Newton load-flow solutions the mathematical decoupling of busbar-voltage angle and magnitude calculations has several computational and conceptual attractions. A hybrid Newton formulation exploiting this principle has been developed and well tested. For moderately-accurate solutions the method has advantages over the formal Newton approach in terms of computer storage and speed, particularly in adjusted solutions, and is at least as reliably convergent."
"The theoretical equations, describing the characteristics of a three phase salient pole type AC generator with asymmetrical damperwindings and bridge rectified output are derived. All resistance and rectifier drops are neglected; only the first winding MMF's and the first two permeance harmonics are considered. All winding inductances are defined in detail in App. I and are expressed in absolute and per-unit values. A set of equations is derived, defining the mutual relations between DC output voltage and current, start and duration of commutation, commutation current, constant and variable field current, damper circuit currents and instantaneous DC voltage fluctuations. By the use of two simplifying assumptions, this set is converted into explicit equations for the above values. These show that the inductance, determining the length of the commutation period is the equivalent of the average between the direct and quadrature subtransient inductances. Both a Star as well as a Delta connected stator winding is discussed. All equations can be expressed in generalized machine parameters. A numerical example is included."
"Using two approximations, the original set of basic equations of Part I applying to a Star connected stator winding is converted into explicit expressions for the average field current If, the commutation angles β and μ, the instantaneous values of all rotor currents and the DC output voltage. The particular characteristics of a Delta connected stator winding are discussed and its equations derived. All expressions are shown both in absolute as well as in per-unit values and can also be used as the initial approximation for the iterative process required to solve the basic set of exact equations of Part I. A numerical example demonstrates the capabilities of the equations."
"This paper provides references to material on engineering economics that is available in general publications as well as publications of the Institute. Engineers faced with the problem of making economic analyses should find it to be a useful source of published information."
"A model the magnetic fields in turbo- generators with either symmetrical or asymmetrical rotor has been developed, and mathematically described and solutions obtained using the digital computer. The model was developed specifically for use in the design stage. It is applied to the entire cross-section of the generator and is applicable to a wide range of machine geometries."
"This paper compares shop floor test results and results from simulation using the model presented in Part I. Also, it contains applications of rated load simulation. The results given are for two typical 4-pole and 2-pole turbo-generators. The 4-pole machine is equipped with an asymmetrically slotted rotor. The results show general agreement, within 2%, between theory and test. Some useful findings are obtained regarding the use of asymmetrically designed rotors. Asymmetry leads to lower flux densities in critically saturated parts of the rotor under full load. The effects of rotor asymmetry on excitation current, quadrature axis synchronous reactance and torque angle under rated full load condition are explored. The effect of saturation at full load on the values of quadrature axis reactance and torque angle is presented."
"Some advantages of rotor slot asymmetry are presented. The study was made using a computerized model of the two and four pole turbo-generator magnetic field based on the principle of magnetic vector potential and finite differences including nonlinearities of magnetic material. Rotor asymmetry reduces the peak value of mid gap flux density and saturation in the stator teeth."
"A review is made of existing methods for calculating the transient field current during three phase and single phase line to line terminal short circuits, since this current determines the ratings of rectifiers in the field supply. An equation, of improved accuracy is given for the three phase fault. Measurements and calculations are shown for laminated and solid pole machines. It is shown that the latter construction gives sufficiently different field currents and decrements to affect rectifier ratings but the new equation can be empirically modified to account for this. A method is given for calculating the inverse voltage of rectifiers during the fault when a rotating exciter is employed. The effect of thyristor waveforms upon bearing currents and frame to ground potential is demonstrated by calculations and measurements."
"In technology concerned with proving the performance of modern high-power circuit-breakers, special spark-gap switches have been developed to meet the specific requirements of 'break' and 'make-break' synthetic circuits, the former operating up to equivalent three. phase test levels of 30 G.V.A. This paper describes the design, performance, characteristics and operating experiences for two types of specialised triggered switches incorporated in the Synthetic test circuits of the Reyrolle Short-Circuit Testing Station."
"A study of random motion effects reveals that broadband seismic disturbances become filtered by mechanical soil-structure systems to produce narrow-band floor response motion under the equipment. The latter corresponds to quasi-resonance vibration buildup at one or more natural frequencies of the building."
"Switchgear in nuclear generating stations must continue to perform its essential functions during earthquakes. Sine beat vibration testing has been used to demonstrate such reliability. These tests have shown that switchgear of standard design will withstand the earthquake levels currently prevalent in nuclear generating station specifications without strength failure or the degradation of the safe performance of principal functions."
"Tearing permits larger problems to be solved on a given computer. It also permits solutions to parts of large network problems when the entire solution is unnecessary. This is very important to power organizations who find it increasingly impractical to solve an entire interconnected power pool when only local answers are desired. The partial inverse provides an excellent means for simplifying tearing while yielding useful intermediate results that have physical and electrical meanings. The tearing aspects presented in this paper have not been previously described."
"A fast approximate method is presented for solving the ac power flow problem for line and generator outages. The method is significantly more accurate than any linear approximation and significantly faster than the Newton-Raphson method for an approximate solution. The method has applications in system planning and operations where approximate ac power flow solutions are acceptable. The method is applicable to system planning for rapid location of design criteria violations and it is particularly well adapted for system operation use as an on-line security monitor. Efficiency is achieved through decoupling of real and reactive power equations, sparse matrix methods, an experimentally determined iteration scheme and the use of the matrix inversion lemma to simulate the effect of branch outages."
"When scheduling generating units for maintenance one of the goals is to level the risks of capacity shortages throughout the year. Level reserves have been used as an indication of level risk. This paper illustrates that better schedules can be found by a method that uses effective capability in place of reserve. The five step method of incorporating risk considerations into existing maintenance scheduling procedures is described and illustrated. The same capacity outage probability table as used in the loss-of-load probability method is used to determine the effective load-carrying capability of each unit to be scheduled. These effective capabilities take the place of the unit ratings in the reserve leveling portion of existing procedures. The loads forecast for each maintenance period are also converted into an equivalent load which reflects the variability of peak loads during the period."
"A simulation a roach suitable for non-linear analysis of the dynamic berformance of large power systems is developed. The problem of matching machine and network equations forms an important criterion in the development of the machine model. Among the major aspects treated is the influence of amortisseur circuits. Organization of system equations is evolved so as to permit rapid solution employing one level iteration of the resulting algebraic equations, which account for a very significant portion of the total computing time. In part II of this paper, network solution procedures and results of investigations carried out on typical systems are presented."
"Comparisons are made between the use of a large scale computer program, and a specialized simulation approach, when determining the value of damping forces present when large sources of generation are perturbed and angular swings develop between such sources, and persist for several seconds. In part I of this paper, the machine modelling and organization of machine-network interconnection equations are discussed."
"An accurate model of a turbogenerator is required for excitation and transient stability studies. Frequency response tests have been made on a 555 MVA unit to determine direct and quadrature axis transfer functions under operating conditions. Digital and analog computations were performed on line in the course of system tests. The performance of the model derived from the test results compares satisfactorily with the behaviour observed in service."
"A comprehensive computer-oriented procedure for Probablistic forecasting of hourly power-system loads with lead times of 1 to 24 hours is described. The forecasts produced are based on both historical load data and information from the latest weather forecast. The methodology combines stochastic load models and adaptive weather- load models optimally to yield an adaptive forecasting procedure especially suited for real-time control of power systems."
"The problem of designing a load frequency control law which reduces transient frequency oscillations (swings) and reduces the number of control signals sent to power houses is investigated. A linear model of an area of an interconnected power system is developed, and a discrete time, linear-plus-deadband, feedback control law is designed. Feedback variables include cumulative inadvertent interchange, frequency deviation, integral of frequency deviation, real power absorbed by loads, and governor-turbine variables. This linear-plus-deadband control is an application of a special case of a more general \"set-theoretic\" class of control laws. A simulation of two areas with two hydro sources is presented. The dynamic response to a step load change is determined for the case of no load frequency control, load frequency control presently used by power companies, and load frequency control designed in this paper."
"An ideal lightning arrester would have a low, precise sparkover unaffected by time or interrupting duty along with high interrupting ability. Most arresters are limited in their approach to this ideal because the sparkover control and interruption functions are performed in the same component-a gap."
"This paper dicusses a new probabilistic generation production cost program which computes the expected production costs for planning study evaluations, Most previous production cost programs have either ignored the existence of forced outages or have included their effects approximatelyby increasingthe length of scheduled outage periods or by reducing the maximum capability of the units in proportion to their forced unavailability. These approximations would seem to availability. These appoximations would seem to neglect the economic effects caused by the probability that randomly occurring unit outages will require the operation of rapidly starting, high cost peaking generation. The program described does consider these random forced outages, as well as scheduled outages. Economic loading of thermal units, consideration of the probabilistic nature of the hydro-electric energy available, and generation system reliability techniques are combined to produce expected values of production costs."
"The basic approach in the determination of generating capacity reliability is to develop a probability model of the generating facilities and then to combine this model with one of the system forecast load. There are two generally accepted techniques for performing a capacity reliability study, the loss of load expectation approach and the frequency and duration technique. The loss of load approach has been used for some time and there are numerous publications available which describe the application in single and interconnected system studies1. The recursive approach to frequency and duration indices appeared more recently and there has been a growing interest in the frequency and duration methods since the publication of a series of papers2-5 on the subject. The basic concepts2 are very powerful and have been used to solve a wide variety of power system reliability problems. In the generation area, this technique has been extended to include load forecast uncertainty6 and reliability evaluation of interconnected systems7-10."
"This paper is a continuation of Part I in which load models based on a multi level (MLEF) approximation and a continuously varying exposure factor (CVEF) representation were proposed. Their convolution with the generation system model was discussed and relationships were derived for the availability and frequency of cumulative margin states. This paper illustrates the concepts proposed in Part I by discussing the numerical results obtained using the developed expressions. Unless stated otherwise, the CVEF representation with constant low load has been used in this paper as the basic representation."
"The equations for computing frequency and duration indices of generating capacity reliability in interconnected systems were developed in Part I1 of this series of papers. A basic assumption used in this development was that the load models in interconnected systems are stochastically independent. In actual practice, the load models may be independent or correlated depending upon factors such as the geographical location of the interconnected systems and the weather sensitivity of the loads. This paper shows how the equations developed in Part I can be extended to the case of perfectly correlated load models."
"This paper shows how the theory of semi-Markov processes can be used to obtain some important figures of merit from non-exponential failure models of generating units. The approach is used to obtain the time dependent state probabilities, the distribution of the time to transit from one state to another and the distribution of the number of visits to a given state in a fixed amount of time for a three-state model in which the occupancy times of two of the states is not exponential."
"The problem of establishing the parameters of the equivalent circuit of an HV impulse generator is examined in order to predict and verify the resulting waveshapes, which are normally attained either analytically or through an analogue model."
"A contemporary approach to the high response excitation system for hydroelectric generators is described. This approach eliminates the conventional mechanical commutator, the main generator field collector rings, and many field power connections and switching devices external to the generating unit. Excitation power generation, and commutation are accomplished by using an AC exciter and thyristor rectifier bridge directly connected to the generator shaft. These elements, in combination with a sophisticated static regulator depending only on electrically derived inputs, provide improved positive damping of electric power system oscillations by proper control of excitation. This system was first applied to three 142,105 KVA, 90 RPM generators now in commercial operation."
"This paper describes and outlines early working experience with a nationwide data collection scheme introduced to permit the statistical analysis of interruptions in customers supplies and the performances at times of fault of electricity distribution systems and their servicing organisations. Some equipment and system failure rates, assessments of the security of complete systems, and typical fault operation rates for switchgear based on national results over six years are included."
"A mathematical analysis of shunt capacitor application for loss reduction in distribution feeder is presented. Generalized equations for calculating loss reduction in a feeder with representative loads are derived and the conditions for optimum loss reduction are developed. The results are presented in separate family of curves for convenient determination of loss reduction due to capacitors."
"The DC electrical breakdown of SF6 gas at extra-high- voltages was studied experimentally in coaxial systems of moderate size. The results were compared to a similarity relationship of electric stress for breakdown based on ionization of the gas. For laboratory-clean systems, theory and experiment agree when the macroscopic gradient does not exceed 150 to 200 kV/cm. If the active area of the stressed electrode is small the law remains accurate for higher gradients. Departures from the law are qualitatively explained by including the electrode surface microstructure in its application."
"Properly fitting a power system to the society it serves is an exceedingly difficult and important problem. Service reliability, a very important factor in this fit, has been determined somewhat arbitrarily in the past. Errors here are costly both to the supplier of electric power and to the power consumer. This paper presents the first method for determining economic optimum service reliability. A method for estimating ating the cost of service interruptions is proposed and the cost obtained is compared with values determined by others. A primary purpose of the paper is to provoke discussion and further research into the cost of power r interruptions and the optimizing of system design considering this cost."
"The expected value of generation deficit under conditions of system load loss provides a new parameter for the measure of generation system reliability. As a supplement to loss of load probability, this new parameter proves useful for planning reliable generation systems. This paper presents the mathematical background and calculation procedure necessary to determine the expected magnitude of load loss, considering load and generation uncertainty. Also presented are numerical results displaying the relationship of the expected value of generation deficit to system planning parameters."
"The frequency distribution of stroke current magnitudes proposed in the literature are examined to evaluate the influences nces that the height and type of structure have on the distribution of current magnitudes observed in the structures. These analyses have been performed using a three-dimensional electro-geometric model1. Results indicate that both the height and the type of the structure on which current measurements are made significantly influence the observed frequency distribution. It is suggested that these effects contribute to the differences existing between alternative distributions found in the literature."
"Stator insulation with mica splittings, vacuum impregnated with epoxy resin, originally introduced by Siemens in 1958 and successfully applied to 21 kV generator stator windings since 1963, is today being used with all steam turbine generators being built by Kraftwerk Union and Allis-Chalmers Power Systems. The method of manufacture and the development research, which led to this insulation system, known as Micalastic ®, and the tests which have been continuously carried out for evaluation and production control purposes are described in this paper. Micalastic insulation has proven itself in the faultless operation of numerous large generators."
 "The advent of large generators, requiring higher excitation powers, has led to a steady increase in excitation voltage magnitude. This in turn has meant increases in the pressure test level which the rotor winding must withstand. At present there are differences in the specified pressure test levels in various countries. On the European Continent ent there is a maximum pressure test limit of 3,500 volts, irrespective of the excitation voltage, whilst on the North American Continent the pressure test voltage is 10 times the rated excitation voltage with no maximum limit."

 "Data management and allocation is the systematic, efficient storage and retrieval of data. In impedance matrix (ZBUS) algorithms of power engineering, large blocks of data must be stored and accessed; core storage limitations often require that alternate media be employed as storage elements. The quantity of data in such algorithms makes data management philosophy highly desirable. In this paper, the scheduling of data allocation is considered. Expected retrieval time is improved in building ZBUS, and bus ordering is considered. The result is the more efficient use of peripheral storage."
"The results of a dynamic optimization procedure in the design of load and frequency control (LFC) of power systems are presented. This design is based on the optimal linear regulator theory, accommodated to satisfy the performance objectives of the LFC in large multiarea interconnections. A proportional-plus-integral control law is considered. The paper also analyzes the influence of system and design parameters on power system performance considering two-and three-area interconnections. Finally, the problems of implementation are discussed."
"Four different types of unbalanced short-circuits of an inductor alternator are studied. The case of simultaneous unbalanced short-circuits of the alternator is studied for the first time. For each case, complete solutions for armature, field and damper-circuit currents, short-circuit torque and open-phase voltage are developed. A numerical example solved for all the four cases is given and comparisons for significant points among the four cases are summarized."
"In order to include an accurate representation of loads in steady state stability investigations a method based on state space theory is suggested which due to its flexibility can be applied to any type of terminal equipment. In the present paper it is shown how the dynamical behaviour of loads may have a decisive influence on the stability limit of a power system."
"This paper describes a tuning scheme that uses a self-resonant line trap coil as one leg of a pi-section bandpass filter. The significance of this circuit as a step toward elimination of problems with line trap tuning packs is discussed. Comparisons are drawn with other approaches to these problems."
"This report briefly summarizes the seven papers in the session on DC Transmission. The papers represent a wide range of HVDC topics including control, protection, overvoltages caused by HVDC breakers, ground electrodes and harmonics. Many questions of interest have been put forward and these are accompanied by brief remarks. The purpose is to broaden the scope of discussion on each topic beyond that of the papers and stimulate discussion."
"The requirements of HVdc converter control are achieved by dicrital techniques with minimisation of circuit complexity. Feed-back control is applied to modification of the counting of clock pulses derived from the ac system by a phase-locked frequency multiplier. Symmetry of the derived firinc, oulses can be retained for all modes of operation with smooth transition from full rectification to full inversion."
"This paper elaborates on the principles of-a new type of practicable control scheme for HVdc converters using digital techniques as descri-bed in Part I. The implimentation of the required circuit functions are outlined. The circuits are Intended for real-system application and their-practicability is demonstrated by selected waveforms from tests with a system simulator."
"Use is made of a dynamic simulation programme to investigate the behaviour of HVDC inferconn` ctors during internal and external disturbances resulting in maloperation of the thyristor units. A comparison is made between conventional and newly proposed protective controls for their ability to regain normal operation. Special emphasis is given to invertor bridges connected to relatively small ac systems. An assessment is made of the severity of different types of convertor disturbances which is considered to be of relevance to the design and rating of thyristor-based convertor plant."
"Traveling waves arising from faults on HVdc transmission lines are computed digitally. Different analytical methods are compared and the termination of the lines at converter stations is given attention, including the dynamic effect of the control response which modifies the reflected voltages."
"Analysis of the potential and field distribution in the vicinity of HVDC ground electrodes has-till now been confined to the-case of homogeneous earth. However, the case of an electrode buried in non-uniform earth is of greater practical interest. In most practical cases, the resistance variation of the earth may reasonably be characterised by a two-layer earth model, comprising a top layer of finite depth followed by a layer of different resistivity extending practically down to infinity."
"This paper discusses some of the problems associated with the generation of lightning and switching impulses for research on U.H.V. systems. The solutions adopted for the impulse generators installed in the new U.H.V. laboratory of Electricite de France are described, and some performance details are given."
"This paper describes a precision capacitive voltage divider for impulse voltage measurements. The main feature of the new divider is a compressed-gas capacitor in the high-voltage arm. The divider is insensitive to environmental influences, possesses outstanding high-frequency properties, and causes little loading of the high-voltage circuit. Its excellent linearity and stable ratio permit meaningful high-voltage pulse measurements in the megavolt range."
"Appropriate segmenting and shaping of the rotor slot and bar cross-section, with respect to the skin-effect developing during acceleration, has a great potential in the design optimization of squirrelcage induction motors. - Inherent major non-linearities of the pertinent complex mathematical relations, though, tend to make this potential inaccessible and hidden. This three-part paper introduces a novel concept, as the foundation of a comprehensive model theory, designed to break through the \"non-linearity\" barrier. The derived analysis techniques proved to handle complex speed-torque curve shaping and motor performance optimization problems successfully and efficiently. The presented approach was also instrumental in producing a related invention (U.S. Patent, see Ref. 3), first applied to a group of several large 2-pole motors having special acceleration requirements. The main principle of the model theory is to establish an in-depth direct contact between the performance-effects of the rotor slot geometry and the mental design-optimization process. A great emphasis is given to the visualization of the coherences of electro-magnetic phenomena, motor geometry and motor performance."
"The first step of the presented method development has been, in Section 2 of Part I, the \"ddcoupling\" of slot segments in slot-constant calculations, using segmental \" Weighing Factors\". The direct practical application of the Decoupling Method is restricted to rectangular-top two-segmented slots, having rectangular or tapered bottoit segments. Iteration of this method, indirectly, allows the handling of further rectangular, \"upper\" and \"peak\" segments too."
"The \"Linear Equi-Permeance Rotor Slot\" Model Theory, established in Parts I and II of this paper, have furnished the \"conceptual tooling\" and the methods for the efficient handling of multi-segmented rotor slots, in optimization analyses with respect to shape, number of segments and proportions. In essence, what has been created, is the availability of such design analysis techniques, which do overcome the \"non-linearity barrier\" of design optimizations with multi-segmented rotor slots and consequently, make the true overall motor performance optimization a practical reality, with full consideration given to the entire acceleration speed range too."
"A program has been developed for determining the transmission system interchange capability and those outages and elements which could limit the transfer of energy between interconnected power systems. The method has been extensively tested during interchange capability studies of the Mid-America Interpool Network (MAIN). The program has proven to be an effective planning and operating tool, reducing both the engineering and computer time required to analyze interchange limitations."
"Extra high OF cables insulated by synthetic paper exclusively made of synthetic polymer were developed. It has been proved that the synthetic paper, given a structure similar to conventional paper, showed more favorable electric and physical characteristics and oil resistance, thus solving problems of extra high OF cables using films for insulation. This improvement is due to a structure having minute pores. This report develops considerations on this point. Trial OF cables with the synthetic paper for insulation were produced and tested on their characteristics; the measured results were satisfactory. Heating tests by loading power were conducted on its model samples. The test results showed that the synthetic paper is superior over the kraft paper as the insulator because of better heat resistance of its component polymers."
"Studies of the development of pre-discharges with large air gaps and positive switching voltages of 1.5 and 2.0 MV are reported. Measurements of the charge flowing into the gap and recordings obtained with a high-resolution image converter have shown that the origin of the filamentary brush-like discharges moves forward at an almost constant rate of a few cm/Ms, and that variations in luminosity are accompanied by similar fluctuations in the transfer of charge. The space behind the streamers remains without light except when a leader is formed for a short time in the event of a charge step. The discussion is illustrated by numerous photographs and oscillograms."
"This paper discusses some of the physical processes involved in the flashover of insulators with contaminated surfaces. Past theories of discharge propagation across moist films are reviewed and found to be unsatisfactory in certain respects. To better account for what is observed, it is proposed that under certain conditions contamination flashover is an electrical breakdown process, rather than a drying process or an electrical instability as has been generallly assumed."
"In order to study some of the processes occurring during flashover, wet contaminant tests were done on a simple flat plate insulator. The effects of such factors as contaminant surface resistivity, the amount of inert binder (bentonite), the use of a different binder (kaolinite), and insulator orientation were studied. Additional data was obtained on time to flashover and the drying effect of the preliminary discharging. Some interesting polarity effects were noted."
"The results of field experience and greatly increased laboratory test data on Resistance Graded insulators are reported. The continued success of this approach to the solution of severe contamination problems is confirmed. Parameters for future consideration and design of insulators using this approach are given."
"There has been a growing awareness in the electrical power industry of the necessity of protecting high voltage switchgears against anticipated severe earthquakes. The authors have accumulated data from a number of investigations into the seismic construction of this equipment. In addition, experiments conducted with a powerful hydraulic shaking table have confirmed the pertinence of the analytical data. These data have resulted in a practical and effective method of insuring the seismic design of high voltage switchgear. Many different types of high voltage power circuit breakers and gas insulated compact substations (GIS) have been constructed based on these procedures, and the security of this equipment has been verified during several recent earthquakes in Japan."
"The lack of knowledge of the behavior of loads during the voltage depressions caused by faults in HV grids has been emphasized on many occasions. Field and laboratory tests were advocated for more realistic representation of loads in transient stability studies."
"The paper continues the discussion of a probability method for the \"on-line\" assessment of the near-term future security of an operating bulk power system begun in Reference [1]. The present paper presents the development of probability models for normally- operating components needed for implementation of the probabilistic security assessment method."
"The paper continues the description of a probability method for bulk power system security assessment begun in companion papers. The present paper describes probability models for stand-by generators. Also discussed are methods for collecting and analyzing field data to obtain parameters needed for probability models."
"The theory of parametric power transformers is developed, and it is shown that the secondary side of the transformer operates as a parametric power oscil lator and is described by a non-l inear second-order differential equation with periodic coefficientsof the Hill's -Mathieus type. In developing the theory, attention is focused on the secondary inductance as the variable circuit parameter responsible for the oscillations. The double frequency variation in the inductance necessaryforparametric excitation is produced by the primary flux and is looked at as a modulating effect. The saturation of the secondary core also affects the secondary inductance and leads to the appearance of the non-linear term in the equation which is necessary to limit the amplitude of oscillations that otherwise tends to grow without bound."
"In recent months, it has seemed that there was much confusion in the use of measurements in corona testing. On the one hand, the thought was that the charge as measured was apparent only and defied analysis. The other was that a measurement might be correlated to a dangerous level. Measurements in one case would be a discussion of detection only and not interpretation. In the other, a level might be assigned which would be satisfactory to define a safe and long life."
"In the steady-state analysis of salient pole alternators the reactances Xd and Xq are generally assumed to be constant. This is not the case in saturated machines. The reactances are functions of the operational regime of the alternators, and for an exact analysis of the alternator's behavior the appropriate values of Xd and Xq have to be used. The magnetic induction is found in the cross section of the alternator by difference methods established at the Universityl and then saturated Xd and Xq are determined from flux plots. The results confirm that Xd and Xq are load dependent. The analysis is applied to a General Electric alternator with nameplate data 82.5 MVA, 16.5 kV, wye-connected, 40 poles and 60 Hz."
"Resonant voltage conditions on an unenergized 765 kV line with shunt reactor compensation, excited by a nearby energized 345 kV line are examined as a function of reactor MVA rating. Results from two methods of analysis are presented. One method uses ABCD matrix analysis in a digital program and the other method uses an electrostatic argument. The electrostatic analysis predicts the number and location of the resonant peaks while the ABCD method yields the entire response curve."
"Steady-state overvoltages can occur on EHV transmission systems during various system operating conditions. The voltage waveforms are characterized by a periodic waveform which may be distorted by harmonics if iron saturation of equipment on the lines occurs. This paper discusses the results of digital and transient network analyzer (Anacom) studies which analyzed system parameters with respect to their effect on harmonics in steady-state overvoltages. Special emphasis was focused on the factors influencing harmonic distortion of the steady-state voltages."
"The differential equations for the ladder approximation to a transmission line are computationally inattractive due to the high value of the spectral radius (high frequencies of oscillation) of the resulting equations. Existing methods for the evaluation of the transient response of the transmission lines generally consider either lossless or distortionless lines. Some methods include losses. All methods with the exception of the ladder representation use the principle of superposition and cannot therefore be used for lines with non-linear parameters."

 "In 1967 the PTC resistor was introduced to the American TV industry for color television degaussing. This new component caused comparisons of performance and economics to be made with existing techniques. The PTC degausser offered sufficient advantages so that by 1971 it was used in 50% of color televisions made in this country. After a general review of degaussing this paper explains the circuitry, advantages, and\u007fdisa\u007f disadvantages of various degaussing techniques."
"The performance of a V.H.F. tuner under strong signal reception is limited by the nonlinear effects that take place either in the R.F. or the mixer stages. These nonlinearities will either modify the amplitude of the incoming signal (cross-modulation or overload) or generate new frequency components (inter-modulation or harmonic distortion)."
"Many TV set manufacturers are considering new chassis designs which use dc controls because of the many advantages offered by that type of system. Perhaps the most important dc control is channel selection. A varactor tuner can be used to make dc tuning possible. The tuner can then be placed anywhere on the TV chassis giving the manufacturer greater flexibility in electrical and mechanical design. In addition, reliability is improved in the absence of mechanical RF switches."
"The system to be described, shown in Figure 1, employs raster scan \"painting\" to provide rich, flicker-free pictures. Color images are displayed at a resolution compatible with commercial television, while a high-resolution black and white display also exists for those cases where the standard resolution is inadequate. The mapping function, which is complex for this type of painting mode, is performed partially in the computer and partially in the display controller hardware. The controller and the magnetic disc perform automatic refreshing and handle the interfacing and data buffering functions. The computer used in the system is an IBM 1130 equipped with 8K of core, a disc, a card reader/punch, and a line printer. The computer services all user communications and provides system interactivity via the console keyboard. A set of FORTRAN-callable graphic subroutines is used in applications programs to generate images. The overall operation is as follows: 1. The computer generates the picture information and performs part of the mapping function. 2. The information is transferred to the controller, where the mapping to digital video is completed. The video is then put on the refresh disc. 3. The controller refreshes the displays by continuously reading out the digital video from the disc."
"This paper presents the preliminary results of a program to increase circuit reliability while reducing engineering time and maintaining cost control. To implement this program, it was first necessary to derive equations for use in the design and analysis of different amplifier circuits, which included both AC and DC parameters. Although Class \"B\" amplifier theory has been covered in numerous textbooks, previous papers, and application notes, there is no reference of which we are aware that considers anything but the basic output circuit and power supply. For a complete analysis, it is necessary to consider the effects of Class \"B\" drivers, DC feedback and Class \"B\" bias means. The equations derived may be grouped into two categories; (1) generalized equations applicable to any output confi,guration, and relating power output to power supply voltage and current, and to transistor dissipation, and; (2) equations for DC and thermal analysis of specific circuit configurations. The classical loop equation method was used for the DC equations."
"F. M. Stereo Multiplex Demodulation is typically performed by (1) product detection and matrixing, or (2) square wave switching. In either case great emphasis has been placed upon utilizing a symmetrical waveform; that is, a non-distorted cosine wave in case (1), and a square wave with 50% duty cycle in case (2)."
"A previous paper experimentally showed the possible nonlinear operating modes of a phase locked loop (PLL) subjected to a sinusoidally modulated input signal. 1 In the present paper, the PLL is considered as the nonlinear device it really is and its behavior is analyzed in locked operation. The results obtained give a new insight into PLL operation."
 "A Monolithic Power Driver has been designed to drive a pair of complementary output transistors. This prime function is as an audio amplifier for outputs up to 70 W rms. It features low standby current l4mA typical; high output current capability, 120 mA; low bias current; 1.5 uA typical; internal current limiting; external current and power limiting; adjustable quiescent current in the output transistors with temperature compensation; wide power bandwidth 100 kHz; wide power supply operating range, 10-50V and excellent linearity."

 "This paper presents some unique device characteristics and typical applications of a power amplifier. The device incorporates such features as high current capability, temperature shut down and short circuit protection. It also offers a choice of operation over a wide range of output loads and supply voltages. Simple external circuitry and minimal circuit components make this IC an outstanding candidate for low to medium power audio systems, high power audio driver, servo motor driver, low voltage high current adjustable power supply and numerous thick film applications."
"A new dimension has been added to monolithic integrated circuit (IC) voltage regulators. A combination of circuit, device and processing innovations has led to the development of the μA7800 series of 3-lead, 20-watt voltage regulators which feature output current capability in excess of 1A, low noise, and excellent regulation. They are available in fixed output voltage options covering the range of 5V to 30V using a built-in internal resistor matrix."
 "The advent of cablecasting has brought about renewed interest in the possiblities for new and improved performance in color television systems. The closed circuit environment, new technology for wide-bandwidths, new large area displays, and better signal transmission systems make it desirable to obtain the best possible performance from the NTSC system that is now serving very well for broadcast over-the-air transmissions."
"Rapid progress has been made recently in color TV sets. In Japan the first fully transistorized color TV set was placed on the market in 1968. The performance and reliability superior to those of tube TV sets allowed most color TV sets to be transistorized in 1970."
 "Are heatsinks really needed in the red-green-blue video amplifier? Their cost is appreciable. In large-volume consumer production, engineering effort to eliminate heatsinks is well worthwhile. This effort may make use of computer aid. In particular, computer programs having statistical analysis routines may be applied to power dissipation levels, thus providing greater information about transistor junction temperatures."
"Conventional high voltage supplies for color TV occupy much space, with both rectifier and flyback transformer enclosed in a metal cage. The solid insulation materials used allow the possibility of smoke emission owing to a small production error as voltages of up to 30KV at 15.75 KHz are generated."
"Recently several component manufacturers have introduced to the market a computer tuning radio which will tune in any selected station. Due to the cost of these systems they can only be offered in the top of the line. In my paper I would like to introduce a system which offers a greatly simplified approach to the problem of computer tuning."

  "Application of digital technique is of growing importance in the field of consumer electronics. This paper describes the details of a total electronic digital tuning system using logic circuits for controlling TV varactor tuners. The system has solved the problems of conventional controlling mechanisms."
"The usual method of determining impulse noise susceptibility is to feed various levels of noise from the motor in an electric shaver, electric eraser or electric drill to the antenna leads of a TV receiver and observe the effect upon the picture. The designer then attempts to determine what section of the TV receiver is being affected by the noise. This rather unknown level and type of noise is difficult to reproduce for comparison of various receiver designs. The method here proposed to test the receiver provides a known level of noise to test for horizontal and vertical sync stability, AGC set up, and white streaking."
"Of the numerous functions required of the IF amplifier in a modern television receiver, selectivity is undoubtedly the most difficult to achieve. Operating parameters such as gain, stability, linearity, signal-handling ability, voltage output and gain-reduction capability are achieved by rather straightforward means of design. Selectivity requirements are severe, calling for placement of several specific frequencies with close tolerance within the passband of the amplifier while simultaneously attempting to reject frequencies extremely close to the edges of the desired passband. In color television receivers, the problem is especially compounded because results depend on maintenance of low phase distortion between the 6 dB points of the response curve. The new bandpass-filter IF amplifier efficiently handles these problems and helps produce a high quality picture even from a low quality signal."
"TBA 440 resembles a sensitive IF amplifier, a double balanced detector and an AGC system for IF and RF with adjustable threshold and tuner delay in a comon 16 lead DIP-case. The IF-amplifier is dc-coupled from input to the video outputs and gain controlled in two stages by variable emitter-degeneration. Thus the number of external components could be minimized. The circuit offers excellent large signal capability and low noise level over the whole AGC-range. The dc-level of the video outputs and of the AGC threshold are temperature compensated."
 "In the past there has been several approaches to the solid state horizontal deflection of magnetically deflected picture tubes. Some of the most recent circuitshave been based on the wellestablished trace-driven principle in combination with some kind of converter power-supply (1). Others have been based on the retrace-driven principle, and here the application of silicon controlled rectifiers have been most interesting (2)."
"Recent developments in the CATV industry have made it imperative that the Broadcast Television Receiver Manufacturing Industry take a hard look at its product and the CATV interface requirements. The growth of this new mar-ket certainly will be dependent on the TV Receiver Manufacturing Industry and how it responds to these interface requirements. The real question is whether the CATV Industry will grow \"because\" of the Receiver Manufacturers response or \"in spite of it\"."
"Since RCA introduced the internal pole piece gun in the 700 picture tube in 1954, dynamic convergence of the individual beams has been the standard of the industry. With the 900 precision in-line color picture tube assembly, RCA introduces a totally new concept in color television display system utilizing an advanced design of the electron gun, the deflection yoke, and the picture tube to achieve superior performance in a simplified inherently lower-cost system. The combination of a precision unitized close-spaced in-line gun and a line-focus type PST ( precision static toroid) deflection yoke makes practical the first inherent self-converging color system. Convergence equivalent or superior to that of present commercial receivers is achieved without the use of any dynamic convergence correction or circuitry."
"An internally compensated low noise stereo preamplifier has been designed for consumer applications. It is characterized by 106 dB open loop gain, 76 dB S/N ratio (R1AA) and 0. 1% distortion when supplying 9Vrms to a 2KΩload using a 30V supply."
"Recent advent of varactor diode tuners has stimulated TV engineers to devise novel electronic channel selecors. The authors have developed a fully integrated channel selection system using only two IC's; one p-channel MOS LSI for channel selection and one bipolar IC for voltage selection."

 "General Electric has developed and plans to introduce commercially in 1972 a large screen television receiver that features an RGB plug-in module with all input signals AC coupled. The RGB module utilizes a unique DC restoration technique and video amplifier design in conjunction with a passive matrixing network. The RBG video amplifiers will provide 150 volts of video drive, however the stress ratio on the components is such that the module has an estimated *MTBF of 56000 hours, (based on component failure rates published in MIL HDBK 217 A)."
"A system has been proposed for the transmission of accurate time information during Line 21 of the vertical interval of standard television broadcasts. This paper will desctibe the basic system and its implementation in an approach to digital tuning. Many uses have been suggested for the vertical interval , including test signals, facsimile, etc. The National Bureau of Standards proposes using one of the lines for transmission of digitally encoded time information. The line chosen was originally line 1 but this was subsequently changed to line 21 due to the line 1 bypass used in broadcast processors. The information contained in the code would include -NBS time, local time, channel identification, 64 characters of text and a precise 1 MHz reference signal. The text is intended for deaf viewers, emergency codes, subtitles, network communications, etc."
"This paper describes a phase locked loop color subcarrier regenerator system employing internal monolithic phasing elements in the color APC, ACC detector, and color tint circuitry. External dc controls are provided for frequency set-up, killer threshold, and color tint."
"Until comparatively recently the concept of using digital methods in consumer equipment was dismissed as impractical, unnecessary and prohibitively expensive. New developments in semiconductor technology, transmission systems and FCC regulations have brought about a situation where digital techniques are now not only economically and technically feasible but also necessary. Some of the factors involved include the availability of complex MOS LSI (Large Scale Integration) devices, the National Bureau of Standards time code transmission system and the UHF tuning parity regulations. This paper will endeavor to discuss these factors and how they may affect future TV receiver design."
"Sylvania has long been actively engaged in the development of color television display systems, and during the past five years, studies have particularly and 1100 deflection systems both for delta and inline°gun arr°ys. This work has revealed that toroidal yokes are inherently precise magnetic deflection components which overcome the imperfections of saddle yokes in that they provide nearer to optimum beam landing, convergence, and consistency in production. As a majo consupplier of picture tubes, Sylvania believes it is in a position to optimize the combination of picture tube and yoke for better performance; the result of work to date has been the development of a family of toroidal yokes specifically designed to complement the characteristics of the present generation of color picture tubes."
"The wound section of a television receiver has seen several evolutions since 1966 and has been extensively described in the literature. 4 Although phase locked systems have been introduced, 5 the more classical approaches to the sound function have dominated both the TV and FM scenes. A block diagram of the TV sound function is shown in Figure 1."

  "The response of RCL corona-pulse detectors is investigated as a function of the calibration-pulse rise time. Excitationpulse rise times ranging from 0.05-50 μs are employed and the resulting signal response waveform and magnitude are recorded. The peak response is found to diminish appreciably with the rise time for values in excess of 1.0 μs; significant response waveform changes are manifest with rise times greater than 3.0 μs. A multichannel pulse-height analyzer is utilized to demonstrate the errors inherent in response signal magnitude distribution measurements when calibration is carried out with square pulses having different rise and decay times."
"Dielectric specimens in the shape of a frustum of a cone were evaluated for surface flashover strength in vacuum of 10-5 torr. Data were obtained for positive and negative pulses of several hundred kilovolts amplitude and with rise times in the nanosecond and microsecond region. The results indicate that most materials exhibit a greater resistance to breakdown if the base of the cone is at the cathode and that the strength is greatly affected by the angle that the dielectric makes with the applied field. Lucite, polystyrene, polyethylene, cast Nylon, and 7740 glass are shown to be relatively resistant to flashover in comparison with the ceramics and molded plastics. It is also observed that the surface strength in vacuum is a small fraction (approximately 1/10 or less) of the volume strength and consequently breakdown through the bulk seldom occurs. Data are given for several common insulating materials."
"The need for a standard procedure for evaluating the relative thermal life and temperature rating of new thin-wall general-purpose aircraft wire insulation is presented from the point of view of the aircraft manufacturer. Problems relative to safety considerations, cost, expected life, temperature rating, and the confusion resulting from the lack of standard test procedures are presented and discussed. A simple specific procedure utilizing the Arrhenius plot is demonstrated and is proposed as a basis for an IEEE Standard for determining the relative thermal life and temperature rating of aerospace wire insulation. Test data on life curves and thermal ratings are presented on six types of wire insulation of present interest in the aircraft industry. These results illustrate the ease of directly comparing the thermal life of various new thin-wall insulation systems relative to the older insulation systems of known service characteristics. Included in the paper are three irradiated insulation systems as well as various insulations that utilize polyimide polymers."
"The equations governing the thermal degradation of electrical insulation and those governing the shape of a thermogram have been combined to give that of the required life line. The numerical solution has been shown to require an empirical correlation between the physical properties involved. In the case of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), weight loss can be correlated with electric strength (the failure criterion) in an independent experiment. However, in differential thermal analysis (DTA) (at least with normal DTA technique) the heat evolved cannot be correlated with electric strength. By means of a numerical integration of a DTA thermogram, together with the determination of the cell cooling constant, an activation energy can nevertheless be obtained and the thermal rating estimated. DTA constitutes an ideal supporting technique, since if the activation energy agrees with that given by TGA this is good confirmation that the value is appropriate to life-line slope. A worked example of the method (using a formvar enamel) is described in detail."
"A method has been devised for rapidly determining the thermal stability of polymers. It is based upon a previously described thermogravimetric method for predicting the thermal ratings of wire enamels. By using only one thermogram per sample and at a standard heating rate, determining the activation energy, and assuming a 50-percent weight-loss failure criterion, the approximate thermal rating is fixed and read off a diagram. During chemical development work, when a series of structural modifications to the polymer is carried out, the progress can be mapped on the diagram and the experimental program thereby accelerated."
"This is Part II of a three-part series presenting statistical methods for planning and analyzing temperature-accelerated life tests with the Arrhenius model, when all test units are run to failure.

These methods are illustrated throughout with accelerated life-test data on insulation. While the methods are presented for the Arrhenius model, they can be used for planning and analyzing many other accelerated life-test situations."

 "A technique is described for rapid reproducible testing of contaminated outdoor insulators. The test parameters can be controlled to permit comparison of insulators under different conditions. Erosion and tracking resistance of polymeric insulators in functional designs can be studied by controlling the test parameters. A conductive mist is sprayed on the insulator while oscilloscope traces of the current wave are measured and examined. Test variables that can be controlled include voltage, spray volume, conductivity of the contaminant, and time. The insulator test features rapidity and reproducibility allowing the user to quickly compare new designs with conventional geometries. It is possible to vary the test parameters so as to represent a variety of environmental conditions that may exist in the field. The test method makes no attempt to simulate a specific environmental condition. Illustrative data are included for conventional porcelain-suspension insulators that are compared to results for a DuPont Teflon polytetrafluoroethylene rod and a quartz rod."
"Flashover voltage, scintillation current, resistance of a number of simple insulator geometries (rods, disks, and cones) have been measured under contaminated conditions. Results have been compared with porcelain suspension insulators. Tests were made in a high-density conducting mist and correlated with the resistivity of the contaminant solution. With such tests it seems possible to optimize insulator geometries. Flashover voltage of about twice that for conventional 6-in-long porcelain suspension insulators has been demonstrated for small-diameter cones on rods. While maintaining the same clearance distance1 for an insulator design, the effectiveness (per unit length of additional creepage distance) decreases with an increase in creepage distance. This is especially true in the vertical orientation. An increase in insulator diameter decreases effectiveness. Small-diameter rods perform well. Current measurements and photographs of scintillation and partial flashovers provide insight into insulator performance. Scintillation and arcing currents may lead to tracking and erosion of plastic insulators. Optimized design can reduce such currents by as much as 20 times."
"The electrical breakdown of hexane was investigated using nanosecond duration high-voltage pulses. An attempt was made to experimentally isolate the formative time lag contributions of the two major breakdown mechanisms: electron avalanche and streamer processes. The electrode area was kept constant at 2.85 cm2 throughout the study, and time resolution was on the order of 0.5 ns. The gap spacing and the applied field were varied in a highly controlled manner. A series of breakdown events were studied for gap spacings ranging from 0.07 to 0.41 cm with selected constant field strengths from 0.8 to 1.6 MV/cm. The results obtained indicate that the streamer mechanism is the dominant process in the breakdown of hexane and the average velocity of propagation is on the order of 107 cm/s for the fields and gap spacings used in this study."
"Lives of pin-plane and sphere-plane configurations were investigated. The number of impulses required to produce breakdown depended on the applied stress, the specimen thickness and area, and the resin formulation. Theoretical models were constructed suggesting an avalanche or streamer type of breakdown destroying dielectric near the anode. Breakdown parameters were estimated."

 "A rapid measurement of thermal deterioration of oil-immersed papers by mass spectrometer and gas chromatograph is described. A special assembly was developed using a mercury diffusion pump and automatic Topler pump to extract a very small quantity of generated gas from the oil and to collect it in a reservoir. The gas collected by the above assembly is analyzed by mass spectrometer and gas chromatograph. Logarithm of the generation rate of (CO + CO2) [log (CO + CO2)] is proportional to the reciprocal of absolute temperature (1/T). This linear relationship can be explained by chemical reaction-rate theory and it is shown that the thermal endurance and the thermal life of insulating papers in oil can be estimated by the generation rate of (CO + CO2) in a few weeks as was reported previously for air and vacuum. But the change of the slope of the line log (CO + CO2) versus 1/T at the temperature near 130°C was observed. This is a new mechanism of thermal deterioration of insulating paper in oil, which is apparently unexplained."
"A new calorimetric method for measurements of insulation aging rate is introduced. The method is based on measurements of the heat flow caused by the heat absorbed or liberated in aging reaction. In isothermal conditions, this heat flow is proporticnal to the reaction rate. The instrument is sensitive enough for reactionrate measurements down to the service temperatures of materials. Using an appropriate gas circulation system, the tests can be performed in different atmospheres. In this way, the competing reactions in an aging process can be observed separately. Any type of solid material can be tested: solid block, film, powder, etc. Some test results on a few well-known insulating materials are described. A new procedure for aging tests, based on the use of isothermal differential calorimetry, is proposed."
"New synthetic resin insulation systems have been established in Japan, as in Europe and the United States [2], and have a history of almost fifteen years. The research work of authors, initiated in 1949, led to the completion of the unsaturated polyester insulation system called SLS insulation. Outstanding performance was obtained as of 1957 when this new insulation system was applied to large rotary-type machinery. In the meantime, a trial manufacture study was conducted on epoxy-resin insulation in view of its excellent electrical and mechanical properties. As a result, an epoxy insulating system of quality distinctly superior to the former system was successfully put on a mass-production basis. This paper describes the fundamental insulation procedure, the dielectric properties, and the service experience of this system."
"The volume of oil under the highest stress has been shown to correlate well with the measured breakdown voltages of transformer oil in different electrode systems. The determination of the volume of oil that is most highly stressed in a given electrode system is not however an easy matter. It involves the location of equistress or equigradient surfaces followed by computation of the oil volume contained within the surfaces. This paper describes a differential probe and amplifier system, which has been developed to allow the direct plotting of equigradient lines on a conducting paper analog of any two-dimensional electrostatic field."
"This paper describes the effects of adding small concentrations of organic additives (anthraquinone, benzophenone, and diphenyl) to transformer oil on its gassing characteristics under different gas phases (H2, N2, O2, and air), different stresses and different temperatures. The results show that there exists an optimum concentration for each of the additives used. The optimum concentrations were found to be independent of the gas phase used. Also, for a given test liquid the results indicate the presence of an optimum stress for both gas-evolving and gas-absorbing oils. The results obtained are explained in terms of the free radical mechanism for gassing of oils under electrical stress."
"Calculating the life expectancy of electrical insulation is an interesting application of Arrhenius's law. Bussing's analytical treatment is derived for the simple case of life at constant temperature. Its extension to variable temperature conditions is explained as is the application of the same techniques to calculating mechanical failure due to creep and capacitor failure due to electrode diffusion. Lastly, recently developed techniques for rapid determination of the slopes of Arrhenius's-law graphs for insulation life are reviewed."

 "The properties of polypropylene paper have been examined for possible use as an insulating material for power transmission cables carrying electric stresses excess of 500 kV. Typical physical and mechanical properties of dry and impregnated non-woven polypropylene are described. The effect of the composition of the impregnant on these properties was also investigated. Analyses of the results indicate that polypropylene webs could become a promising replacement for Kraft paper in cable insulation."
"Surface conductance of outdoor insulators exposed to pollution and moisture from rain or fog is related to two aspects of insulator application: 1) possibility of insulator flashover and 2) duration and severity of surface arc discharges. This paper will discuss some of the experience with monitoring the surface conductance of porcelain and synthetic insulation under voltage stress and exposed to outdoor weathering in various locations in the U. S. Simple flat surfaces mounted at a 30° angle from the horizontal and some shed-type insulators have been followed in this study. Recordings have been made over periods of several years, comparing results with low and high voltage stress. Results of these outdoor tests are also compared with results of tests of similar surfaces in a synthetic salt-fog chamber."
"The surface of cylindrical insulators placed in high vacuum becomes positively charged when subjected to a high-voltage stress parallel to the dielectric surface. A study is made of the variation of the surface charge density as a function of the voltage applied to insulators made of alumina ceramic, nylon, Teflon® and Plexiglas®. Direct and pulsed voltages were used in the experiments."
"This paper presents results on flashover voltages across insulation surfaces and on the rate of surface deterioration in a vacuum of 10-5 torr under direct, alternating, and surge voltages of front duration in the range from 1-600 μs. The insulation material used was polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) of cylindrical shape fitted between uniform field electrodes. The measurements were carried out on insulator specimens 25 mm in diameter and 5, 10, and 20 mm in length."
"The dielectric constant and loss, as well as the resistivity of a cable insulating oil, have been measured as a function of temperature and frequency before and after successive oxidations. The dielectric loss, and its distribution of relaxation times changes slightly with the degree of oxidation, but the resistivity decreases by more than an order of magnitude. However, the activation energy for conduction remains unchanged. A previously unreported result is that the frequency of the maximum of the dielectric loss decreases with the degree of oxidation. A tentative semiquantitative molecular model to account for the activation energy for conduction is presented."
"A review of the available formulas for predicting the complex permittivity of mixtures of dielectrics has revealed some of their limitations. The authors pro-ose altemative formulas, which are straightforward and less time consuming. Measured values of e' and e\", obtained from experiments conducted on mixtures of transformer oil, cottonseed oil, and castor oil in differcnt volumetric proportions, are in close agreement with their predicted values."

"A single conductor of arbitrary length is placed close to the surface of a conducting cylinder parallel to its axis. Impedances are connected between the ends of the cable and the cylinder. An incident monochromatic plane electromagnetic wave propagates in the longitudinal direction and is thus polarized in a transverse plane with respect to the axes of the external conductor and the cylinder. The component of the electric field tangent to the terminating impedance excites the circuit. The objective is to derive formulas for the currents in these impedances. The transverse dimensions of the conductor satisfy the inequalities a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ∞, where a1 is the radius of the external conductor and a2 is the radius of the cylinder. It is assumed that the distance d between adjacent points on the conductor and the rocket is small compared with the wavelength."
"Three circuits are analyzed. One consists of an isolated two-wire transmission line with terminating impedances; another of a single conductor with terminating impedances grounded to an infinite perfectly conducting plane; and, finally, a terminated two-wire transmission line in the vicinity of an infinite perfectly conducting plane. In all cases a plane monochromatic electromagnetic wave is incident on the wires with the electric vector parallel to their axes. The wires are oriented with respect to the incident field and the ground plane, if present, for maximum response. The objective is to derive formulas for the currents in the load impedances of the three circuit configurations described in the preceding. The writer then presents a heuristic argument to the effect that solutions of these problems bracket the response of exposed unshielded one-and two-wire transmission lines arranged parallel to the axis of a rocket and close to its surface. The established upper and lower bounds for the load currents are sufficiently close together to be of considerable practical value in the study of the electromagnetic compatibility of rockets."
"The concept of a coupling (transfer) impedance as developed by Schelkunoff for cylindrical tubes is applied in the determination of the mutual coupling to a grounded coaxial cable. Formulas are developed utilizing the coupling impedance concept when the exciting, or interfering, circuit is either a single-wire line or another coaxial cable over a ground plane."
"Fragmentation of spectrum management responsibilities and authority is resulting in less than optimum electromagnetic spectrum utilization in the United States. To begin to implement a solution to this problem, a phased program which would ultimately centralize all administrative, engineering, and record-keeping activities related to spectrum management is proposed. A \"national spectrum manager\" is proposed who would have the authority and capability necessary to design spectrum utilization patterns by applying state-of-the-art analysis, information, and monitoring techniques to the electromagnetic compatibility problem. The need for computer simulation and interference prediction capabilities is discussed. The problems involved in keeping existing spectrum users \"happy,\" while serving new users under changing use patterns and rules, are discussed. Approaches to the validation of the analytical capability are treated. Possible applications of the resulting capabilities and techniques to international spectrum management are discussed. The ever-present subject of cost is raised, and several possible methods of financing such a system are reviewed. Also touched upon are future problems and applications, such as those relating to space and satellite communications."
"HF noise (2-8 MHz) as a function of azimuth, frequency, and time of day was measured in England during the winter of 1966-1967. For a given frequency interval eight unequal azimuthal sectors (with five sectors between 45°-180°) were sampled each four hours in a standardized fashion. Power levels for the tenth, fiftieth, and ninetieth percentiles were derived and plotted. The results provide the integrated total external noise (both local and propagated). In addition to the well-known distinctive diurnal and frequency changes, a marked variation with azimuth is present. A separate examination of noise intensities measured simultaneously from several azimuths reveals strong differences with azimuth. The investigation indicates that noise levels as a function of azimuth are needed and are the ones to be applied to practical HF systems."
"The results of a recent survey of power line noise levels at a number of locations-ranging from an urban business office to a rural farm-are given."
"I have just had occasion to look over the August issue of this TRANSACTIONS, which consists of the Proceedings of the 1971 Walsh Function Symposium. The theoretical investigations of Walsh functions and their potential to such areas as linear and nonlinear filtering, image processing and pattern recognition, bandwidth compression, and signal detection offer promise of attractive new applications to the field of communications engineering. It appears appropriate that both the AdCom and the TRANSACTIONS staffs review their policies with regard to supporting technical programs and papers so that their efforts will concentrate more succinctly on areas of direct interest to EMC Group members.[Editor's Note: The August 1971 issue of this TRANSACTIONS was apparently not well introduced to our readers. Evidence of this fact is found in the foregoing, as well as in other unpublished correspondence. Basically, letters ask, \"Why should Walsh functions, admittedly important to some groups, receive so much attention from the EMC Group ?\" The answer is found in a logical argument which runs in the following way. EMC engineers are going to be concerned more and more with digital systems in the future-digital applications are growing at an ever increasing rate. Consequently, EMC engineers, to remain viable as a group, must learn to cope with external interactions involving digital systems. Required modifications to digital systems, including certain types of digital filters, are conveniently based upon Walsh function theory. It behooves the EMC engineer to become acquainted with this tool or face the possibility of obsolescence.]"
"The magnitude of noise induced into communication cable from electromagnetic influences is reduced by the shielding properties of the metallic shield. One of these properties is the surface transfer impedance. The surface transfer impedance relates the current induced on one side of a shield to the longitudinal voltage appearing on the other side due to that current. At low frequencies the surface transfer impedance for nonpermeable materials is equal to the dc resistance of the shield. At high frequencies it decreases rapidly. The frequency at which the decrease begins is a function of the thickness and conductivity of the metal. For cylindrical shields having longitudinal seams, the transfer impedance increases at somewhat higher frequencies. The size of the seam opening determines the frequency at which the increase begins. Although the size of the seam opening is difficult to control, experimental results are in relatively good agreement with theoretical calculations."

 "Theoretical foundations for an analytical model of urban radio-noise environments are presented at a level of generality broad enough to include the pertinent physical and statistical elements which critically influence the temporal and statistical character of such interference in radio receivers. The central roles of geometry, directionality (beam patterns), waveforms (from the interfering sources), motion (Doppler), source density and distribution, and secular variations of source parameters, as well as the radiation mechanism, are specifically developed. The basic statistical model (BSM) involves independent sources, in space (and in time), leading to Poisson radiation fields and a Poisson process X(t) in a typical receiver. This received process X(t) can be considered the sum of a Gauss process (by the central limit theorem) representing the cumulative effects of a large number of sources, none of which is very large vis-à-vis the rest, and a Poisson process produced by those few strong transients which when present dominate the background. The process X(t) is essentially stationary for periods comparable to the secular period of changes in traffic intensity and flow, which permits the construction of usefully large experimental ensembles from which to estimate the process statistics. A semiempirical, but more analytically tractable model similar to that introduced by Hall [6] for impulsive atmospheric noise but used here for independent sources is also constructed. This model is represented by X(t) = a(t) Z(t), where a,Z are independent processes, both zero mean, and Z is regarded as Gaussian."
"A general theory is advanced for determining the currents in the load impedances of an N-conductor isolated transmission line excited by an electromagnetic field with the electric vector directed parallel to the wires. The number of impedance loads in the circuit is 2N. An impedance is connected in series with each conductor at its ends. At each end of the transmission line the impedances emanate from a common node. There is no requirement that the conductors be of the same radius, be equally spaced, or lie in a common plane; however, their axes must be parallel. Evidently the cross section of the line must be sufficiently small in terms of the wavelength that transmission line theory applies. Numerical values for the load currents In a three-conductor model are given. Scattering from end loaded multiconductor transmission lines is considered. It is shown that for configurations lacking geometrical symmetry such problems become arduous if not solved by computer."
"The crosstalk induced in a particular cable by other nearby current carrying cables is of significance in predicting the behavior of systems using such cables. Unfortunately, computational difficulties and ignorance of the actual problem geometry (as opposed to the nominal geometry) often make the calculation of the crosstalk uncertain or impossible. In this paper a method is devised for expressing the rms value of the crosstalk, and the resulting expression is investigated for a particular class of cables. The models proposed are applicable only to long low-frequency cables constructed of nonmagnetic materials. Electrostatic effects are not considered."
"A theoretical analysis of pulse spectral components is given which shows that the pulse area remains invariant under a wide range of restrictions. A complementary practical measurement technique shows that information required for calibration purposes can be derived from spectral measurements and is recommended for such purposes."
 "Five comments are made on the above paper.' The first pertains to the overall approach used in this model in comparison with an earlier model. Other comments pertain to what appear to be errors in the paper. An important, but originally incorrect, equation is derived in the Appendix."
"It is suggested that noise grade maps may be given for two frequencies rather than one to improve the accuracy of predictions. Further, predictions should be given for spot hours rather than on a time block, basis as the time block concept has serious shortcomings."
 "The reception of unwanted noise can be drastically reduced in a single-phase transmission line by employing 2N, N = 1,2,. ., conductors with alternate wires connected in parallel. The cross section of the line forms a regular polygon. The advantage of the four-wire line over the two-wire line for discrimination against noise is exhibited."

"Three-dimensional computer plots of the cross-ambiguity function are developed in order to illustrate the discrimination against improperly coded signals in a pulse compression matched filter. The filter response envelope amplitude is plotted as a function of time and frequency offset for input signals mismatched in FM rate, pulsewidth, and timedomain amplitude weighting. Illustrative examples of the unnormalized cross-ambiguity diagram reveal the signal-to-interference ratio improvement of this filter in the presence of signals with no FM or reverse slope FM. The effect of Hamming weighting on the waveform response is also shown."
"A brief history of man-made noise interference is provided. A series of examples of this type of radio interference points out the generally insidious_or in a few instances the somewhat ridiculous_nature and effects of man-made noise. It is demonstrated how the Pacific Missile Range and the Western Area Frequency Coordinator mitigate man-made noise by the use of area controls, engineering, testing, monitoring, training, and frequency management."
"An approximate formula is derived for the currents in the loads terminating a two-wire line located parallel to and near a circular conducting cylinder of finite length. The line and the cylinder are illuminated by an incident plane wave. The analysis takes account of the coupling between the line and the cylinder and hence of the effects of possible axial resonances in the latter. The configuration simulates exposed conductors used to interconnect the electronic apparatus in a rocket. The analysis is directed toward determining possible hazards due to induced currents."

"A rocket with removed access plate is simulated by a section of coaxial transmission line with a transverse elliptical slot cut in its sheath. The internal circuit consists of two arbitrary impedances in series with the inner conductor at its ends. The object is to find the currents in these impedances when the cylinder is illuminated from the outside by an electromagneticfield that enters the aperture and excites the internal circuit. The problem is solved by application of the reciprocal theorem. The current in a dipole antenna is determined when this is inthe far field maintained by the slotted coaxial line when driven by a generator in series with one of the load impedances. The field in the aperture is replaced by equivalent electric and magnetic dipoles. The reciprocal theorem gives the current in the load impedance when the distantdipole is driven. A numerical example is given."
"The paper explains the advantages of and compares various forms of four-level phase modulation from the point of view of performance, implementation, and spectrum usage. The results are applicable to digital mobile radio systems employing a large number of transmissions in which cochannel and adjacent channel interference are experienced. Of particular interest is the extent to which the theoretical spectra may be realized with practical transmitters. Differences between theoretical spectra and those measured from practical power amplifiers are identified. A method of simulating the effects of power amplifier nonlinearities is described and results are presented which agree closely with measurements made on an actual power amplifier."

 "A method is presented for choosing the zero pattern of the z transform of a Huffman (impulse-equivalent) sequence so that the energy of the sequence is large for a given peak amplitude. The scheme applies to real and complex Huffman sequences. Illustrative examples are given and the ambiguity functions of the synthesized signals are shown."
"In general, circuit reliability can be enhanced by either incorporating redundancy or by minimizing a circuits component count. Conventional nonregulating converters generally require two active devices, whereas in regulating converters or switching regulators as many as 10 transistors, either integrated or discrete, is not uncommon. A regulating dc-to-dc converter which provides useful regulation and which can be constructed with either two or three transistors is described."
"Photocounting distributions, the decision threshold, and the probability of error are obtained for a binary optical communication system in which both the signal and background radiation are Gaussian processes. This would be the case, for example, when the radiation source is a nonlocked multimode laser or when the received radiation is scattered from a satellite. Dark current is considered. The results indicate that when possible, counting times should be adjusted to be large in comparison with the background radiation coherence time, and optical amplification before detection should be employed."
"The search process of an airborne laser-seeker system is studied to maximize the probability of target acquisition with respect to the following parameters: altitude, velocity, seeker scan angle, seeker depression angle, laser illuminator peak power, scan pattern, and acceptance logic. The relationships between the objective variable and the first five parameters are established through a regression analysis of data points collected from a computerized system model. Classical techniques applied to the regression equation isolate a local maximum. Scan pattern and acceptance logic are each studied separately since their optima are independent of the other parameters of the system. Maximum probability of target acquisition is nearly unity."
"Distribution-free methods and maximum-likelihood estimation technique have been previously suggested for constant-false-alarm-rate (CFAR) processors. The first technique assumes no a priori environmental knowledge and the second assumes almost complete environmental knowledge. Several intermediate environmental assumptions are considered. The performance of single-pulse transmission signal processors that produce CFAR for the different environments is analyzed. Probability of target detection is evaluated for Rayleigh interference and Swerling I target. It is shown that adaptive threshold techniques implemented by logarithmic amplifiers, instead of linear amplifiers, can attain better false-alarm-rate control with only small loss in target detectability."
"The receiver signal of a general angle tracking radar where there is asingle target which consists of a set of n reflectors is analyzed. It is shown how the analysis of this radar can be greatly simplified by representing the signals in the receiver as complex variables. This representation also makes it very easy to analyze such problems as scintillation and single-sideband crosstalk."
"The factors which affect the target-handling capacity of an agile-beamelectronically scanned multitarget-tracking radar are reviewed and analyze.Consideration is given to the choice of strategy for dwell allocation amongtargets, the choice of trajectory extrapolation algorithms for target tracking, and the determination of saturation target acquisition rates. Emphasisis placed upon radar systems with control computers having limited speed and memory, and recommendations are made for allocation strategy and targetytracking algorithms, based on uniform sampling, to be used in maximizing thetarget-handling capacity in this situation."
"When the cumulative drift in the center frequency of a binary split-phase FSK signal exceeds the peak deviation of the signal, a conventional noncoherent receiver (i.e., one provided with only two IF filters) may be unable to achieve the probability of error per bit which the designer desires. This limitation may be overcome if the receiver is provided with a bank of more than two contiguous filters (each followed by an envelope detector) tospan the total IF band the instantaneous IF signal might occupy. It is shown that the probability of error per bit for such a receiver is a function of 1) the ratio F of peak frequency deviation to peak frequency drift, 2) the number M of IF filter/detectors, and 3) the signal-to-noise ratio ß in the output of the filter containing the signal. It is further shown thatfor a given value of F an increase in M reduces the amount of transmitter power the communication system designer must provide to yield a given probability of error per bit."
"It is shown that the digital-data-transition tracking loop, previouslydevised using physical reasonings, is actually a practical implementation of an optimum (maximum likelihood) self-bit synchronizer."
"Optimization of the bandwidth of a turnaround transponder is carried out for weak signals at the transponder receiver. Optimum transponder bandwidth is found to be around 0.77-1, where T is the period of one element of the ranging code. Linear transponders are compared with transponders having baseband limiting. Phase modulation is assumed. It is shown that, for weak signals, linear transponders are preferable for a partitioning of the transponder transmitted power giving (carrier power)/(total power) > 0.43, while baseband limiters are preferred for (carrier power)/(total power) < 0.43."
"Barton's [1] procedure is further simplified to require only the use of a single-valued detector loss curve plus ideal detector curves to calculate the performance of envelope detectors with postdetection integration."
"The trend toward digital processing of radar and sonar signals has ledto the use of \"baseband\" or bipolar video signals. The processingof both the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) channels generally allows an exact representation of the signals, and no loss of sensitivity need occur. However, for reasons of economy or weight only one channel is often implemented. This correspondence shows that the sensitivity loss for this case often deviates considerably from the 3-dB rule of thumb."
"Probability density expressions associated with the noncoherent detection of a sinusoidal signal have been obtained. The signal is assumed to be imbedded in sinusoidal clutter at the same frequency and narrow-band Gaussian noise. The density expressions are shown to be a function of the signal-to-noise power ratio and the clutter-to-noise power ratio. The expressions have been numerically evaluated for a number of conditions, and the results under each reception hypothesis are presented graphically. Under large-sample conditions, the probability density for a multisample test statistic is shown to be Gaussian, and the probability of detection expression is written such that commonly available tabulated data can be utilized to determine the probabilities."
"A study of the effect of observation errors on the best least squares estimate of satellite attitude based on two sets of direction measurements, where one set contains two independent measurements which are corrupted by zero-mean normally distributed additive errors, is summarized. Using Monte-Carlo techniques, the statistics of the estimated rotation of the satellite, from a known reference, were obtained. It was found that one of the parameterizations of the rotation, namely, the vector z, is best suited for estimation, since Δz is normally distributed with zero mean and its standard deviation is independent of the two direction measurements."
"A joint detection threshold corresponding to a circle around the origin of the in-phase and quadrature components of a radar IF process is equivalent to envelope thresholding. Square and octagonal approximations to the circle are evaluated for prescribed false-alarm probabilities and the variation of detection probability with signal phase."
 "Significant IEEE papers and items of correspondence in the radar field are dispersed through many publications, not covered by a comprehensive index. To assist the radar system engineer in locating material of interest, the following cumulative index, limited to the IRE/IEEE journals published since World War II, has been prepared. The 41 subject headings are somewhat arbitrary, but they cover the field of radar as shown in Table I. Listings under each subject are chronological, and the journals covered are listed in Table II. Papers on components and circuit design are generally excluded, and the subsystem areas are covered only to the extent needed in performing system engineering. In spite of omissions, however, it is believed that the index should prove useful to many engineers in the radar field. Correspondence is indicated by the letter c after the page numbers. Supplementary issues (e.g., EASTCON) are indicated by (Sup) after the page numbers. Presence of a correction, comment, or addendum in a subsequent issue of the same journal is shown by the year and page number of the item in brackets."

 "The outputs of a vertical monopole and two mutually perpendicular slots in a horizontal plane can be properly combined to yield a steerable cardioid-shaped pattern for vertically polarized waves. The required weighting factors for placing the pattern null in any desired direction are presented in graphical form. The shape and the half-power beamwidth of the steerable pattern are examined. This combination antenna unit offers important advantages in direction finding and other applications, especially at microwave frequencies."
"An analysis is presented which deals with the effects of polarization mismatch errors on the accuracy of a phase interferometer used for position location of unknown emitters relative to known calibration emitters. Closed-form expressions for the induced phase difference between interferometer antennas are derived for several combinations of receiving and transmitting antenna polarizations. Errors contributed by mechanical misalignment between antennas, as well as effects of power loss attributable to polarization mismatch, are also considered. The analysis leads to the conclusion that circularly polarized interferometer and transmitter antennas are best suited for the position location application, if it is assumed that polarization tracking of the interferometer antennas is not available. It is shown that a reasonable amount of ellipticity can be tolerated before the phase error becomes significant."
"Information on the position of a source of radiation is often obtained from bearing observations made from two or more known locations. Some criticisms of existing procedures are enumerated and a new approach proposed. This approach allows for the incorporation of knowledge existing before the observations are made and provides simple computational procedures for obtaining both the a posteriori density function of the source position and an estimate of this position from the observed data."
"The feasibility of constructing composite rotors in the laboratory for use on a 60- to 120-Hz supply has been established and the experimental results with such rotors have been published for the first time. Results obtained from the tests made on a three-phase induction motor with different solid-iron as well as composite rotors are presented. These are compared with the theoretically predicted characteristics based on existing analytical as well as numerical analyses."
"A system concept for remote measurement of vehicle orientation with only passive devices mounted on a vehicle is presented. Three channels of polarization-modulated light are used to determine all three degrees of freedom of vehicle orientation. Two important system components are described, a polarization rotator and a retroreflector which leaves the polarization state invariant. Also, the method of data reduction is outlined and the system accuracy is discussed."
"The application of a highly parallel computer known as PEPE (Parallel Element Processing Ensemble) to radar data processing is described. The PEPE computer consists of a large number of identical processing elements which operate in parallel and are controlled by a common control unit. Each of the processing elements is assigned to a particular radar target such that many targets can be tracked in parallel. PEPE is designed to augment a conventional computer rather than to stand alone. The total data processing load associated with a radar tracking system is distributed between PEPE and the sequential machine in a manner than maximizes the overall system efficiency and desensitizes the system performance to fluctuations in traffic levels. The use of PEPE provides very high data processing throughput potential to a radar data processing system."
"A method of determining the predetection signal-to-noise power ratio in a radio receiving system by measurement of average postdetection signal-plus-noise and noise-only voltages (dc output of the detector) is described. The principle has actually been known for many years, but does not seem to be well known or widely used, possibly because of some associated computational difficulties. Some digital computer tabulated results are presented which remove these difficulties, and measurement techniques are discussed. The calculation of expected signal-to-noise ratio for radio and radar systems is briefly reviewed."
"The optimum processing (likelihood functional) is found for a set of M images {Zm = Sm + Y + Nm}, each the sum of a member Sm of a signal sequence {Sm}, due to an object to be detected and its parameters estimated, a sample function Nm of a noise field {Nm}, and a sample function Y of a common background field {Y}. The noise fields {{Nm}} are independent, zero mean, white Gaussian fields, all independent of the background field {Y}; the latter is assumed to be either 1} completely unknown or of known mean and covariance functions with 2) a certain fluctuation property or 3) Gaussian. Three equivalent forms of the optimum processing are found: 1) a summation of generalized matched filterings of the images, 2) a summation of matched filtering of certain generalized differences of the images, 3) a summation of \"estimator-correlator\" type filterings. The detection performance and optimum signal/image selection under the Neyman-Pearson criterion is given and the singularity of the ({{Nm = O}} and M > 1) case noted. It is shown that optimum processor and signal design can completely eliminate any effect of the background on detectability (M > 1). The Cramer-Rao lower bound for the signal parameter estimates meansquare error is given along with an example; optimum signal/image selection in the single parameter case is discussed."
"A He-Ne laser beam is sent through a common path differential interferometer and the interference signal is detected by a p-i-n photodiode. Weak phase objects can be examined because optical path changes can be resolved to 0.1 Å with a time resolution of about 20 ns. Examples for different gas-dynamic investigations show good results and demonstrate the wide field of application for this type of laser interferometer."
"Comparative utilization of a limited amount of energy for continuous and pulse operations was investigated. Under a restriction that the amount of available energy was limited, general equations for operational hours of the energy source for given power output were derived for both continuous and pulse mode operations. This paper points out that due to various adjustable parameters available for pulse mode operation, if properly designed pulse mode operation produces longer utilization of available energy for required output power than continuous mode operation."
"Measurements of sea clutter at low grazing angles using high- resolution radar show that the probability density p(x) of envelope detected sea clutter is not Rayleigh. Using the composite surface scattering model, a special varying clutter density p(x|σ0) is proposed and is used to explain the non-Rayleigh nature of clutter. Since the clutter distribution has an enormous effect on the performance of a radar, the variation of the clutter densities, p(x) and p(x|σ0), with various radar parameters such as frequency, pulsewidth, and polarization is found. Finally, a simulation of the composite surface scattering model is performed, and it verifies the effect of the various parameters on p(x)."
"An experiment is described which was used to evaluate a typical pilot's ability to activate a switch in response to a sound stimulus. Regularly spaced voice countdown, irregular voice countdown, initiation of a tone, and termination of a tone were each used as the stimulus. The individual under test was given a task similar to that involved in maintaining accurate flight conditions to occupy his attention. The regular voice countdown is shown to be least accurate in defining the switching time, providing a mean delay of approximately -0.09 second (actually a stimulus anticipation) and a standard deviation of a bit more than 0.2 second. In each of the other cases, a mean delay of approximately 0.25 second and a standard deviation of approximately 0.09 second were obtained. This compares favorably with previous experimental results."
"An airborne microwave hologram radar system has been developed which is a two-dimensional analog to optical holography. The field of view of the radar is directly below and to either side of the aircraft. Resolution is realized in the along-track direction by utilizing the synthetic aperture technique, and in the cross-track direction by means of a phased receiving array. The theory of operation is summarized, the demonstration system is described, and results for both the normal and contouring modes of operation are presented."
"The optimal solution is presented to a cooperative game which is described by a common quadratic cost functional subject to linear ordinary differential equation constraints. The optimal feedback controller is constructed for both players when all components of the state vector can be measured. For the case that only some components of the state vector are available, the optimal feedback controller is designed using a dynamic observer. As a specific application, the approach is used in determining the optimal feedback controllers for two satellites which are performing a rendezvous on a circular orbit. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the applicability of the approach."
"Two new methods for navigation on the land are reported. Both methods make use of landmarks which are in sight but whose positions are not known. Only angle measurements are needed. Although the methods were intended for guiding a Lunar Roving Vehicle as it travels on the lunar surface, they may also find applications on other planets as well as on Earth. Besides the mathematical details, two examples are also included to demonstrate the correctness of the method."
"The concept, operation, and predicted performance of an RF tracking control system used to point the Pioneer F/G spacecraft at the Earth is described. This system employs a modified conical scanning technique called Conscan. The signal processor, the most interesting unit of the system, is described in detail to show that it approximates a maximum likelihood estimator. The dynamic behavior of the spacecraft and the stability analysis of the system are presented, demonstrating that the system performance is basically determined by the open-loop phase and amplitude errors introduced by the antenna, receiver, and signal processor. A detailed error budget shows that the phase and amplitude errors are small. Finally, closed-loop simulation and test data are presented to verify the error budget."
"A common approximation for the variance of a function of two random variables is obtained via a series expansion. It is shown that for some cases the error in the approximation is quite large. This approximation is sometimes used to compare the relative merits of two alternate systems. The comparison might be erroneous if the system differences are comparable to the approximation errors."
"The effects of implementation errors in tapped delay line filters on the peak-to-sidelobe ratio and the signal-to-noise ratio of binary PSK pulse compression codes are considered. As error model the delay elements and weighting factors of such filters are assumed to have an error distribution with known mean and variance."
"The jointly optimal filters of a filter-sampler-filter system, representative of a fixed-range radar, are shown to each have impulse-response functions of the form a · cos(at), 0 ≤ t ≤ π/2a."
"This correspondence reports measurements taken in both the 4- and 6-GHz frequency bands of the protection afforded a pit-shielded Earth-station antenna. The measurement program described is an expansion of a previous one and was designed to determine the effects of artificial site shielding for a range of satellite locations rather than a single position."

 "The simple Doppler-shift formula fD = v/λ shows that frequency changes (fD) useful for actual practice have to be based on either rapid changes of the distance between transmitter and receiver (v) or the application of very short waves (λ), and this with high frequency stability. Both conditions became feasible only during the last twenty years because of rapid technological progress. Some applications of the Doppler effect are described in connection with a number of modern radio-location systems."
"An analysis of the factors affecting aircraft takeoff and landing weights is presented. This analysis, made with the aid of a computer, considers all factors, including: type of aircraft; weight; temperature; wind; engines; payload; policies; limits; runway slope, conditions, and length; obstructions; and aircraft flap settings."
"Analysis indicates that the rotation of a satellite can cause an error in the range-rate measurements of a two-way Doppler tracking system. The error is proportional to the rotation rate, and the constant of proportionality depends on the polarization of the satellite transponder antennas. Measurements made by ground-based simulation confirmed the analytical prediction."
"For many years Norwegian airports have been equipped with instrument landing system (ILS) localizers of conventional type. Most of the localizers, however, were found not to perform very well on these sites. The course bends were too large and even moderate amounts of snow and ice could cause the localizer to fall out of operation. To overcome these difficulties, the requirements for localizer operation at these airports were analyzed and a new and improved antenna system developed. After a long period of operational testing, during which it was made clear that a substantial improvement in performance had been achieved, the new localizer antenna system is now in operation at 13 Norwegian airports."
"Detailed derivation of the transfer function for a multigimbal, elastically supported, tuned gyro is presented and comparison made between its characteristics and those of a classical two-axis, free-rotor gyro. Knowledge of the gyro transfer function is necessary for the purpose of servo analysis of the system in which the gyro is used; also, the transfer function is a basis of evaluation of errors caused by angular inputs that occur at twice spin frequency."
"An elastically supported, tuned gyroscope is a complex device, but experience has shown that it can be represented by mathematical models by means of which practically all of its characteristic errors can be analyzed and predicted with good accuracy. The gyro angular transfer function, derived in [1], serves as an excellent basis of evaluation of errors due to asymmetries of the gimballing system and effects of rotor angular offsets. The gyro translational transfer function, derived in this paper, may be used in the analysis of errors caused by linear acceleration inputs."
"The Discrete Address Beacon System (DABS) is scheduled to replace the Air Traffic Control Beacon System (ATCRBS) as the prime sensing tool for air traffic control in the 1980's. The design of DABS requires knowledge of the tracking accuracy obtainable as a function of various system parameters. In particular, the potential value of air-to-ground telemetry of turn-rate data and its effect on intermittent positive control (IPC) must be assessed. The design of DABS tracking algorithms is discussed, and the results obtained with a Kalman tracker simulation are given. The major finding is that turn-rate telemetry of moderate accuracy can improve tracking by a factor of 6 to 10."
"A typical function of an angle tracking loop is to keep a radar antenna pointed at a target. The error in pointing is directly related to successful operation of the tracking device; therefore, its behavior is of interest. For a tracker with a general polynomial nonlinearity, an arbitrary initial pointing error, and a bounded deterministic input, a method is developed for finding upper bounds on the magnitude of the tracking error using Volterra series techniques. Convergence regions of the Volterra series are also obtained. Applications of these results are made to a second-order tracking device."
"The optimal terminal rendezvous of two satellites in orbit about the Earth is studied using a stochastic model and formulating the rendezvous as a game problem. Each satellite has noise-corrupted output measurements and uses a Kalman filter to generate the best estimate of the states describing the rendezvous. The optimal control for the satellites is determined. A comparison is made in terms of dimensionality and complexity to a deterministic solution of the rendezvous problem."
"Two techniques for estimating the correlation function of a stationary random process using the method of stochastic approximation are developed. Both provide updated estimates as successive T-second observations are processed. Both assume a functional form for the correlation function that depends on a number of parameters that are estimated. One technique is based on the mean-square error; the other maximizes a likelihood function. Examples are included."
"A general set of equations is developed from which the effects of initial condition perturbations upon weapon impact point are readily evaluated. Data are presented to illustrate the accuracy with which predictions can be made. Results obtained from the actual ballistic equations, from the time-varying perturbation equations, and from a time-invariant approximation of the perturbation equations are compared. It is shown that reasonable impact point predictive accuracy can be provited for fairly large changes in initial conditions."
"An automatic data processing system for the evaluation of statistically occurring Doppler-difference bursts is described. In addition to the higher accuracy compared with the data acquisition procedures known so far, this technique allows the Doppler-difference method to be used as an operational instrument for investigations into turbulent flows, especially in the case of low particle density and extremely small turbulence degrees."
"The problem of designing a Wiener filter for the optimum processing of amplitude-modulated (AM) signals transmitted through randomly dispersive media is discussed. Results are obtained that provide effective least-mean-squared-error estimation of the input message when errors which do not represent loss of information are neglected. These results, which differ appreciably from the results that obtain from a deterministic analysis, indicate that there are certain values of the propagation parameters which narrow the filter passband to such an extent that estimation is rendered ineffective."
"The implementation of control systems capable of identifying and adapting to time-varying unknown parameters has become increasingly important in air-traffic control and other applications. In the recent literature the control problem, in which both the initial state vector as well as a vector of constant plant parameters are unknown, has been treated utilizing sensitivity techniques referred to as optimally sensitive control. The concepts of optimally sensitive control as developed by Kokotovic, Perkins, Cruz, and others are extended to the problem in which the state dynamics contain a vector of stochastic inputs which can be represented as Martingale processes. The resulting optimally sensitive system is shown to be an effective and realistic adaptive controller for systems containing unknown time-varying parameters. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting control system at identifying and adapting to the levels of the unknown time-varying inputs."
"A qualitative analysis of the trajectories of a missile pursuing a maneuvering target according to the proportional navigation law is presented. Conditions for a missile to reach the target from any initial state are determined. The existence of a boundary for the required missile acceleration is demonstrated."
"In vehicular and aircraft generating systems, the voltage transient suppressor requirements for protection of utilization loads are generally based on measured values of valtage transients and the generating system impedance. This paper presents an approximate method for determining the suppressor requirements that disregards the generating system impedance. When a voltage surge due to removal of load is suppressed, the greater portion of the removed load current is transferred to the shunt-type suppressor. The influence of generating system voltage regulator design on severity of voltage transients is discussed."
"This study determines through digital simulations the effects of two-antenna interference, defined as interference occurring at the ground guidance system antenna between the signals from two antennas located on, opposite sides of a space vehicle. It is demonstrated that errors due to interference during early booster flight are recovered from at booster cutoff; interference produced errors occurring shortly before cutoff are not recovered; and modulating the gain of one spaceborne antenna is beneficial to guidance in the interference region."
"The maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters of the genalized chi-square distribution are derived and approximated. These estimators are compared with those based on the method of moments."
"The power selection of a search radar is best obtained in the framework of the overall detection probability concept. This concept is here applied to fluctuating target models for single- and multiple-scan detection. The approach combines the pulse train statistics over the detection interval to the mean target statistics over the search region and directly relates the overall detection probability POD to a single system parameter σ0, proportional to the transmitted power."
"The effect of a logarithmic receiver on the detection performance of a radar has been determined by Green by numerical computations for up to 100 pulses integrated. It was further suggested that the loss in decibels as compared to a square-law detector would appear to be proportional to the logarithm of the number of pulses integrated. In this correspondence we show that this \"conjecture\" is false, and that the additional loss when N becomes very large approaches a constant value of 2.2 dB."
"Two new methods of landmark navigation were recently presented. The landmarks are assumed to be within sight of the navigator but with unknown positions. Both methods require computations which are time consuming when a computer is not available. This correspondence presents the concept of a new navigation device called \"landmark navigation rule\" which eliminates all the computation effort required in both new methods. The device is simple in construction, lightweight, and consumes no power."
"The nonlinear characteristic of a sinusoidal phase detector can create an additional loop suppression factor and cause distortion of any phase-modulated data that is to be extracted in a phase-lock loop receiver. The distortion caused by the phase detector's sinusoidal characteristic will degrade the phase-lock loop parameters and decrease the amplitude of the phase-modulated data."

 "This paper addresses some of the more important questions asked by managers and scientists associated with industry, foreign governments, and U.S. agencies regarding remote sensing. The difficulty in answering these questions is simply that no single view by any one of these groups alone provides enough perspective to do the questions justice. Consequently, this paper reflects an attempt to integrate views expressed by many people regarding the following five questions. First, \"What is the background, motivation, and mandates for each of the major participants affecting the development of remote sensing markets?\" Second, \"What can remote sensing techniques do today?\" or, \"What is operationally ready and what is really research?\" Third, \"What will be the most important operational contributions of ERTS-A?\" Fourth, \"What remote sensing subtleties are particularly important to understand?\" And finally, \"How much value is there in remote sensing, for whom and when?\""
"In the first six months of 1971, the United Nations executed surveys using a number of the recently developed geophysical sensors on behalf of the United Nations Development Program in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Lesotho. The Ethiopia and Kenya surveys had the objective of direct exploration for and inventory of geothermal resources and involved coverage of some 39 000 km2 and 1550 km2, respectively, of thermal scanning in the 3 to 5 micron and 8 to 14 micron ranges. The Lesotho survey, experimental in nature, had the objective of exploration for diamondiferous kimberlite pipes and involved some 2600 km2 of aerial survey, utilizing true color, false color, and multispectral photography, scanning in the ultraviolet and 3 to 5 micron and 8 to 14 micron infrared spectra, infrared radiometry, and aeromagnetics. A preliminary evaluation of the results indicates a degree of success that will dictate expanded use of these methods by the United Nations in the future."
"A digital processing approach has been devised for performing motion compensation in a high-resolution airborne synthetic aperture radar in the presence of simultaneous longitudinal (speed change), lateral (turn), and vertical (climb or dive) maneuvers. Both side-look and squint are accommodated in a unified scheme, which is validated by various simulation runs reported herein. Present attention is focused on theoretical verification, irrespective of mechanization or specific parameter values."
"The computerized model permits a mixed fleet of aircraft to \"fly\" over a route structure for a given time period. By doing so, the detailed operational and economic factors are evaluated. In the past, the above-mentioned information was available after the purchase of the aircraft, and the selection of the airplane was done by little-known parameters. This program will furnish the data before the aircraft is purchased, thus taking the guessing from the selection. The high investment makes it mandatory for airline management to examine and to know ahead what to expect from the airplane and what is the acceptable return on this investment. On the other hand, an existing fleet with a given route structure can be analyzed by varying the schedule."
"An analysis of the output of three alternative matched filter configurations in an infrared scanning system model is presented. The sensor is corrupted by thermal noise, generation-recombination noise, photon noise, and modulation noise, the latter providing an extreme discoloration in the signal passband. Expressions for the signal voltage density spectrum, signal pulse shape, noise power spectrum, and average noise power at the matched filter output are derived where the integral evaluations attendant to these derivations do not appear elsewhere in the literature. The paper also provides graphical displays of the signal-to-noise power ratio at the filter output versus various system parameters, noise power spectrum out of the matched filter versus ω, and the signal pulse shape out of the filter versus time. Also included are discussions of practically realizable approximations to the matched filters and curve fitting techniques for the signal pulse shape function."
"This is the first part of a two-part paper which summarizes work pursued by the author in 1966 [1]. The paper describes the application of minimum-variance estimation techniques for in-flight alignment and calibration of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) relative to another IMU and/or some other reference. The first part formulates the problem, and the second part [2] reports numerical results and analyses. The approach taken is to cast the problem into the framework of Kalman-Bucy estimation theory, where velocity and position differences between the two IMU's are used as observations and the IMU parameters of interest become part of the state vector. Instrument quantization and computer roundoff errors are considered as measurement noise, and environmental induced random accelerations are considered as state noise. Typical applications of the technique presented might include the alignment and calibration of IMU's on aircraft carriers, the initialization of rockets or rocket airplanes which are launched from the wing of a mother ship, the alignment and calibration of IMU's which are only used in the latter phases of rocket flight, and for the initialization/updating of SST guidance systems."
"This is the second part of a two-part paper which summarizes work pursued by the author in 1967 [2]. The paper describes the application of minimum-variance estimation techniques for in-flight alignment and calibration of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) relative to another IMU and/or some other reference. The first paper [1] formulates the problem, and this paper reports numerical results and analyses. The approach taken is to cast the problem into the framework of Kalman-Bucy estimation theory, where velocity and position differences between the two IMU's are used as observations and the IMU parameters of interest become part of the state vector. Instrument quantization and computer roundoff errors are considered as measurement noise, and environmental induced random accelerations are considered as state noise. In this paper, numerical results for three important IMU error parameter configurations are presented and discussed. The main results of the paper determine the effects of state and observation noise levels and the nominal trajectory on the identifications of the errors for these configurations. A discussion of the minimum number of trajectory maneuvers and of the optimal trajectory maneuvering is given."
"A high-frequency (HF) aperture was synthesized by receiving ionospherically propagated signals in an airplane. The signals used the one-hop F lower ray mode to propagate a distance of 2600 km and were processed to yield equivalent aperture lengths of 10 km and 70 km. It was shown that apertures of up to 10 km in length could sometimes achieve their ideal free-space directivity without use of ionospheric compensation."
"A new type of control loop is presented for dc/dc regulators, based on the use of a linear analog to pulsewidth modulator. This function, which is independent of operating frequency, permits high sampling frequencies. Combined with a limiter of the analog input, limitation characteristics are automatically available, without any extra sensing on the hot line. The independence of parameters f0 and t1 is demonstrated, and application of the loop to control the regulator output characteristics is shown. This flexibility finds useful applications in high-power systems (1 kW) by permitting parallel unit operations and utilization of modular units."
"Five basic needs for the improvement of system security are identified. Brief discussions are presented in the areas of system design, coordinated operation, more effective operation, and political- public relations problems. Recent results in the fifth basic need for system security, the development of more sophisticated approaches to the problems of system control, are presented. The results are in research areas sponsored by Electric Research Council Research Project RP90. Finally, several suggestions are offered for further research in this vital area of system control."
"Computer-aided instruction (CAI) has not achieved widespread use, even though experimental results have been promising, because of a complex of technical, economic, and social factors. The problems these factors produce might be overcome if a major \"market success\" could be achieved with CAI systems. One potentially high-volume market, having probably a lower resistance to profound innovation than other sectors of education, is the junior college. To achieve a market success which would catalyze public and private investment to sustain the growth and dissemination of CAI requires technical solutions in the areas of hardware, software, and courseware. Courseware is a term designating the applications programs for CAI systems and associated textual, audio-visual, and other materials of instruction. Two different approaches to the production of courseware and their underlying philosophies are discussed and contrasted. The extent to which these different models of courseware design and development might lead toward the goal of mass dissemination is highlighted."
"The title of this paper provides a point of departure for the broadest possible discussion of electric power transmission and presents an opportunity to comment on some misconceptions regarding power systems. The subject of transmission is discussed in terms of 1) the grid concept, 2) its system function, and 3) its probable future development and some of the problems facing such development."
"Generating capacity additions planned for the 1970's and beyond include a high percentage of nuclear power plants. The light water reactor is the dominant type of commercial nuclear reactor being installed during the 1970's. Advancement to more efficient designs, such as the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor, is expected around 1980. Prospects for the breeder reactor and fusion energy systems dictate a major research and development effort. Attempts to control effluents from fossil-fired plants have resulted in a sharp increase in the use of low sulfur fuels. Research and development efforts are being intensified in an attempt to obtain a breakthrough in methods of stack emission control."
"The growth of the Intelsat Global Commercial Communications Satellite System, which provides the facilities used to exchange television programs among many countries of the world, is described. Service was initiated between North America and Western Europe in 1965. Currently, some 48 separate geographic areas throughout the world are interconnected by the Intelsat System. The unique air-transportable Earth terminal, developed by the General Electric Company, at the request of the television networks, to meet the special requirements for providing live television coverage in color of the Apollo recoveries at sea, will also be described."
"Technology will be utilized by the educational field, but only in those areas where it can be proven to be economically feasible. In the area of improving the quality of education, technology will be utilized only by those areas that can afford a large increase in expense. With the promise of reduced costs, and in the face of resistance by entrenched individuals and arguments regarding dehumanization, and in view of the lack of a clear demonstration of effectiveness, technology will remain only a dream for the next decade."
"In an earlier paper by the author the problem of determining the optimum symmetrical weighting factors for a video MTI radar was discussed. This paper extends this work so as to remove the symmetrical restriction from the problem. In addition, for a staggered pulse system, optimum times of transmission are determined. In the earlier paper a global solution to the restricted optimization problem was achieved. In this paper only a locally optimum solution is achieved for the more general problem."
"This paper analyzes a hybrid navigation concept that uses signals from a radio interferometer mounted on a spinning geostationary satellite, preliminary position estimates from self-contained equipment, and stored a priori information on the past performance of this equipment. The craft-borne processor, optimum in the maximum a posteriori (MAP) sense, is designed to estimate position coordinates using only the incoming radio signals, although improved estimates result if the other two items are available. An error analysis starts with the derivation of an estimation error covariance matrix, whose elements depend on additive receiver noise and the physical parameters of the system. A minimum 1σ estimation error in position is obtained by trading off these parameters. The effects of other major error sources, such as tropospheric phase fluctuations, multipath, and craft altitude uncertainty, are added to the estimation error to give a total 1σ position error on the order of 3.7 to 5.6 km."
 "A unique delay-lock tracking system is described. The system includes an interrogator and a repeater operating on the same radio frequency, with a pulse repetition rate which is related to the distance. Single radio frequency operation allows utilization of a superregenerative radio frequency stage, which serves as both the receiver and the transmitter of the interrogator unit."
"The different quantitative criteria (and numerical results) for analytically determining the optimum squint angle of an amplitude monopulse system in the track mode are compared and reconciled, and the results are generalized to include mutual coupling."
"The properties of an adaptive array antenna, including transient response rate and control loop noise, depend on the intensity of the external noise field. The dependence can be reduced by 1-bit digitization of the real and imaginary parts of the signals from which the envelopes in the control loops are formed. This can be done without degrading the performance of the adaptive array."
"The derivation of a simplified method of calculating the time from launch to the smoothed estimate of the first track point for a known value of g by least squares fitting a linear equation is presented. This method eliminates the need for the fifth accumulator, normally used for (Equation), as well as the need for processing this accumulated value in calculating the elevation velocity and position of the first data point."
"Government contracts mandate specifications and standards of specific issues and dates; Government/industry practice involves continuing update of materials, processes, and components documents. These different approaches create hardships in major system procurements, due to long duration of the procurement cycle. Examples of inconsistencies among documents governing electronic systems are discussed and tabulated. Modification of the \"Defense Standardization Manual 4120.3-M\" is recommended, to provide a consistent and practicable Department of Defense policy."
"An analysis of the output of a running integrator in an infrared scanner model is presented. The sensor is corrupted by thermal noise, generation-recombination noise, photon noise, and modulation noise. Expressions for the signal voltage density spectrum, signal pulse shape, noise power spectrum, and average noise power at the integrator output are derived. A graphical description of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the integrator output versus time is included, and a comparison of the integrator SNR with that of a matched filter is provided. Expressions are given for the signal pulse shape and the average noise power when the integration time is subject to small Gaussian errors."
"The relationship between the gain statistics of a system composed of independent cascaded components and those of its individual components is investigated. The first- and second-order moments of the system gain are expressed as a function of the first- and second-order component gain moments. Curves obtained from the resulting system gain variance equation are presented and special cases are discussed."

 "The first demonstration of atomic fission occurred in a laboratory thirty years ago (December 2, 1942). The first electricity from an experimental atomic power plant in the United States was produced fifteen years ago (December 18, 1957). Less than a dozen atomic power plants of significant size have been completed and started operating within the past five years; their brief record of operating experiences is grossly inadequate as a basis for responsible engineering (with absolute safety) and for committing large future investments in this new technology. However, in the utility industry, corporate wisdom and good judgment at the Board of Director level has been perverted by massive campaigns of overselling, irresponsible propaganda, and deliberate deception. This paper identifies some of the more common fallacies."
"The problems of satellite charges with reduced G/T stations for different pre-assigned and demand-assigned modes of operation are considered. A mixed pre-assigned demand-assigned operation is assumed as a model, in which large standard stations use the demand-assigned system for their overflow traffic. Determination of the optimum percentage of overflow for each link and of the global satellite revenue and occupancy, in terms of a general traffic matrix, is carried out and then used in the specific case of the Atlantic satellites to establish demand-assignment and pre-assignment charges as a function of G/T, based on a cost per unit bandwidth criterion. The effects of various demand-assignment systems on the economic balance is also considered."
"A mathematical algorithm using the method of invariant imbedding is developed which generates a best £2 estimate of range and range rate from pulse Doppler data."
"The FM threshold performance of the frequency demodulator with feedback (FMFB) is experimentally optimized. Rules of thumb for the practical design of the FMFB with limiter in the loop are proposed. Such design rules provide for optimum FMFB threshold performance given specifications of the received signal. Equivalences among the FMFB, phase-locked loop, and limiter- discriminator offer some additional physical insight into the threshold-extending mechanism of the FMFB not presented by previous investigators."
"The problem of estimating the state of a turbopump rotating assembly and identifying unknown products of inertia and unknown bearing parameters is considered. A linearized, extended Kalman filtering approach has been used and found to be successful for both state estimation and parameter identification in an inherently nonlinear problem. The input data was simulated Bently test data which was obtained from a verified 12-dimensional state-space model and was compared with real Bently test data obtained from NASA. The results prove the feasibility of using this model and this type of test data to obtain the hidden parameters of a typical turbopump rotating assembly. This method should lead to improved performance by allowing improved balancing of the rotor and giving improved knowledge of the bearing reactions."
"An expression is derived for the probability of error for a conventional binary, noncoherent, frequency-shift-key (NCFSK) communications system under the influence of bandpass Gaussian noise and a linear frequency-modulation jamming waveform. The resulting integral is expressed in terms of the well-known Q function, which depends upon average signal, noise, and jamming powers. The analytical procedures used can be applied to the analysis of the effects of other types of jamming."
"An exact mathematical model is developed for a discrete loop of a general order particularly suitable for digital computation. The deterministic response of the loop to the phase step and the frequency step is investigated. The design of the digital filter for the second-order loop is considered. Use is made of the incremental phase plane to study the phase error behavior of the loop. The model of the noisy loop is derived and the optimization of the loop filter for minimum mean-square error is considered."
"This paper considers the real-time \"desmearing\" of motion- \"smeared\" imagery telemetered from an airborne platform. The specific configuration considered is the direct raster scan readout of a satellite-mounted vidicon. Three types of smearing are considered: 1) linear uniform smearing, 2) linear nonuniform smearing, and 3) nonlinear smearing. The simplest type of smearing, linear uniform, has as its desmearing or inverse filter a circulating delay line (CDL) cascaded with a differentiator. An error analysis of this filter is presented along with an experimental simulation. Linear, non-uniform smearing characterized by the operator \\begin{equation*}\\int^{t}_{t-\\delta(t)}I(\\tau){ }{d\\tau}\\end{equation*} is considered next. Two possible realizations for the inverse filter are discussed as to accuracy and practicality. Finally, an error analysis is performed for the nonlinear smearing that results from a skewing of the raster scan."
"Research in numerous areas is directed toward the resolution of multiple overlapping signals in a noisy environment. These areas include radar, sonar, speech, seismology, and electrophysiology. Sometimes matched filters are used; other times inverse filters are employed. This paper discusses one approach to the analysis of the resolution of inverse filters. Our method is to compromise the trade-off between signal resolution and the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A performance measure for the inverse or deconvolution filter is defined as a quantity proportional to the harmonic mean of the resolution and the SNR. An optimum output pulse duration is obtained using this criterion, where the pulse shape has been previously selected and the input signal waveform is known. In addition, upper and lower bounds for the output pulse duration are presented. Graphs are given which allow the designer to select the optimum inverse filter output pulse duration for a desired signal resolution and an estimated SNR."
"This paper considers a binary frequency-shift-keying (FSK) communication system with an adaptive receiver. Partially coherent detection is accomplished exploiting phase and bit synchronization directly extracted from the information-bearing waveform. The optimum (maximum a posteriori probability criterion) estimators of the relevant channel parameters are found along with some suboptimum realizations. It turns out that these schemes are decision-directed tracking systems that may be implemented using standard circuitry."
"The cell averaging LOG/CFAR receiver is a special implementation of a constant-false-alarm-rate (CFAR) receiver in which the noise level estimate is derived from a set of contiguous time samples of the output of a logarithmic (LOG) detector as obtained from a tapped delay line. This CFAR receiver is capable of operating over a larger dynamic range of noise levels than a conventional cell averaging CFAR receiver, but with somewhat poorer detectability. The performance in stationary Gaussian noise of the cell averaging LOG/CFAR receiver with no post-detection integration is determined in this paper. For a small number of reference noise samples, results were obtained by a Monte Carlo simulation using the technique of importance sampling. For a large number of reference noise samples, a second moment analysis gave the desired results. Both these results can be summarized in the following simple formula, NLOG = 1.65NLIN - 0.65, which relates the number of reference samples required by each of the two receivers for equivalent performance. Thus, for the cell averaging LOG/CFAR receiver to give the same detection performance as the conventional cell averaging CFAR receiver, the number of reference noise samples has to be increased by up to 65 percent."
"The function of the receiver in a binary digital communication system is to make a binary (\"space\", \"mark\" or \"\"0\", \"1\") decision by comparing the signal values from the mark and space filters (or correlators) at known successive time intervals (\"bit\" or \"baud\" time intervals). When the signal value out of the mark filter is greater than that out of the space filter, it is decided that mark or 1 is transmitted, and vice versa. It is of fundamental importance to know the exact instant of time at which the two filter outputs are to be compared. This is the problem of synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver. In this paper, we assume a system that is perfectly synchronized. In a practical system, the difference between the two filter outputs must differ from a threshold by some finite amount in order to cause the device to respond reliably. The examination of the effects of this dead zone (finite-width decision threshold) on digital transmission systems is of important practical interest. Its effects on binary differentially coherent phase-shift-keying, and m-level phase-shift-keying systems have been investigated previously. In this paper we consider its effects on binary coherent phase-shift-keying (CPSK), coherent orthogonal (CFSK), and noncoherent orthogonal (NCFSK) systems. The probability of bit error and the channel capacity of each system is obtained in terms of the dead zone threshold."
"The time at which a received signal crosses a certain level fluctuates in the presence of noise. In this paper, a theoretical formula for the standard deviation of this thresholding time is obtained. The formula is applied to the detection of a pulse perturbed by Gaussian noise. Two practical detection schemes, the peak amplitude estimator and the double differentiator, are theoretically analyzed and compared. Also, a formula is derived which may be used to determine the efficacy of a false-alarm detection system."
"This paper contains a mathematical analysis of the problem of automatically pointing a sighting device, mounted on a moving vehicle, at a fixed target. The results apply to situations such as automatic sighting devices for aircraft and helicopters, automatic camera aiming for airborne photography, etc. Basic mathematical relations, which govern all forms of such automatic pointing devices, are derived."
"This paper examines the possibility of deriving fixed-point smoothing algorithms through exploitation of the known solutions of a higher dimensional filtering problem. It is shown that a simple state augmentation serves to imbed the given n-dimensional smoothing problem into a 2n-dimensional filtering problem. It is further shown that computation of the smoothed estimate and the corresponding error covariance does not require implementation of the 2n-dimensional filtering equations. Some new results involving systems with or without multiple time delays and having colored observation noise have been derived in order to illustrate the versatility of the proposed technique. It is also demonstrated that the present approach leads to an easier derivation of the continuous-time fixed-point smoothing algorithm reported in the literature."
 "A recently developed algorithm which is being used to compute an aircraft reference altitude from air data inputs is accurate in a stationary column of air. However, pressure gradients in the atmosphere can introduce significant errors. An improvement (which corrects for pressure gradient errors) has been developed which is based on the equilibrium equation for the motion of the air mass in the presence of pressure gradients."
"Resolution as a function of aperture length in the presence of phase errors is investigated with the aid of the spatial power spectral density. Numerical calculations are made for power spectra thought to be appropriate for phase errors due to atmospheric turbulence. Both Gaussian and uniform illumination are considered, and the results obtained here are compared with those reported by Brown and Riordan [2]."
"It is shown that for the problem of detecting a nonfluctuating target in Gaussian noise, three common optimality criteria lead to identical multichannel filter designs."
"It is shown that the \"first inversion, transposition, and averaging\" technique [1] is, assuming convergence, quadratically convergent, since it can be developed very simply by the use of quasilinearization. Only the three-dimensional case is considered; the art of matrix orthogonalization is practiced in more general settings [2] than considered here."

 "An electrostatic-wave topside sounder has been flown to study electron plasma resonances. Unique features of this sounder are the preservation of data spectra, a frequency synthesizer, and a gain-change mechanism. Preservation of the spectra provided frequency information with a resolution of a few hundred hertz by use of a fast Fourier transform while the synthesizer provided the necessary frequency stability. The gain-change mechanism provided information on the strength of the resonances. Resulting data support the electrostatic-wave echo theory of topside resonances."
"A foremost characteristic of large dot radar angels is the wide variation of basic parameter values which they exhibit. This variation is traceable to the nature of the underlying phenomena, i.e., birds and flocks of birds. In this paper, statistical distribution models for the mean radar cross section (RCS) and density of radar angels are obtained, based on a combination of radar and direct ornithological data. The radar cross-section distribution model has been derived from a dimensionless RCS versus wavelength model for individual birds, obtained from measured RCS data which have been scaled to a dimensionless form. This model is applied to ornithological data on populations of birds. The density distribution model is based on statistical reduction of migratory bird data obtained by Lowery's moon watching experiment, and observed seasonal and diurnal variations of radar angel activity. Both resulting distribution models are closely appproximated by the log-normal distribution. The model parameters for these distributions are given."
"The optimum processor and its accuracy limit for radar altimetry for geodetic use over the sea are studied with a model accounting for random surface reflectivity, sea height variation, additive noise, and pointing errors, and allowing for arbitrary antenna patterns, signal modulations, and other system parameters. The \"threshold\" case solution (which can have any specified accuracy) dictates a signal modulation bandwidth just shy of resolving the sea height variation and/or illuminated sea area (as scaled into time delay and \"smeared\" by pointing errors). For such a modulation a relatively complete solution is obtained. These results are used to determine practical radar altimeter designs, additionally accounting for antenna size, stability, and peak power restraints. Conditions allowing neglecting of limiting or complicating effects due to temporally varying reflectivity, sea height, and vehicle position are given and shown to be satisfied for a typical satellite."
"A model of a distributed target as a collection of independent, Poisson distributed point scatterers or scattering centers in a range-velocity target space is introduced and is characterized by a deterministic function called the \"scatterer density function.\" This function is the density of the point scatterers in the range-velocity space and can be estimated in a relatively straightforward manner by any radar having adequate resolution in both range and velocity and no ambiguities in the region occupied by the distributed target. The use of the random signal radar with a correlator receiver is considered here and the statistical properties of the correlator output, when the return signal is from a distributed target, are derived. It is shown that the spectral density is simply related to the scatterer density function. The technique is illustrated by an example in which the target is a tornado modeled as a cylinder with constant angular velocity. The example suggests that is a possible to remotely estimate the radar cross section per unit volume as a function of distance from the center of the tornado."
"A Q-switch single-mode ruby laser is used for holographic recording of simulated sonic booms. The gaseous objects are visualized by means of the following techniques: 1) Differential interferometry in polarized light, as well as the Schlieren method with defocused phase plate. Both techniques are applied to the holographically recorded wave (directional lighting).2) Interferometry by double exposure with directional lighting."
"The statistics of aircraft radar cross section (RCS) are estimated by fitting members of the chi-square family of distributions to empirical distributions obtained from blocks of RCS data, each block of data corresponding to a particular aircraft azimuth aspect. The parameters of the fitted distributions vary with azimuth aspect angle, type of aircraft, and radar frequency. Detection probabilities based on the estimated statistics are calculated and compared with detection probabilities based on Rayleigh statistics. This comparison indicates that the average value of radar cross section has much more effect on probability of detection than the normalized variance of RCS, and in the usual situation tends to mask the effect of the normalized variance on probability of detection."
"A new design is described for support electronics used with rate-integrating gyros in strapped-down operation. By using pulses of constant charge to a linear torquer, system simplicity is retained with accuracy of 40 ppm per year."
"z-transform techniques are employed to establish general symmetry and simultaneity properties of the first sensitivity functions of the phase-canonical form of single-input, nth-order, linear, constant, discrete-time, controllable systems. It is demonstrated that computation of the first sensitivity function requires one nth-order model in addition to the system model. This simultaneity property is extended to arbitrary single-input, nth-order, linear, constant, discrete systems. In complete analogy with results presented for continuous systems, symmetry and simultaneity properties may be established for the computation of the /th sensitivity function \\begin{equation*}^{l}\\beta^{y} \\triangleq \\frac{\\partial^{l}y_{i}}{\\partial\\alpha_{Jl}\\partial\\alpha_{Jl-1}\\cdots\\partial\\alpha_{J2}\\partial\\alpha_{J1}}|_{\\alpha=\\alpha_{0}} {\\rm for} \\substack{i = 1,2,\\ldots,n\\\\ J_{k} = 1,2,\\ldots,n\\\\ k = 1,2,\\ldots,l.}\\end{equation*} Extension of these results to multi-input systems is also mentioned. The usefulness of the simultaneity property is illustrated by applying the results to the design of a low-sensitivity optimal control law."
"A hardness assurance program suitable for a retaliatory or deterrent missile system is discussed. The program consists of three phases: the establishment of suitable controls and screens to ensure piece part hardness, a supplier data monitoring program to measure hardness related parameters in a timely fashion to obtain advanced warning of potential problems, and a hardness assurance verification testing (HAVT) program to periodically measure the radiation response of parts, circuits, subsystems, and systems on a sample basis to ensure proper functioning in simulated radiation environments. All of the data relevant to hardness assurance is stored in computer memory and routinely interrogated with programs which compare current results with the engineering baseline data and other data from preceding lots. Other computer programs enable statistical estimation of system response to the radiation environment with confidence based on the expanding data base provided by the HAVT program."
"The equations of motion for the stable member of a threegimbal platform are presented [3]. These equations are combined with models of the three platform control loops to formulate a model for the system. The system model is simplified and a digital simulation is developed for studying the motion of the stable member under conditions of dynamic vehicle angular environment."
"A detailed analytical study is made of the effect of FM noise on a laser carrier frequency which is used in a Doppler radar. Both long-term drift and short-term FM noise are considered. The case of high modulation index of the noise is permitted by the theory. Forward as well as slanted beams are examined. Curves have been calculated for each case to allow rapid estimates of the bandwidth requirements to accomodate the laser noise. This, in turn, will give the resolution limit of the radar caused by that noise. A summary of the results is given."
"A Cartesian coordinate linear regression filter is utilized for tracking maneuvering aircraft targets. Measurements of target position are made in a line-of-sight coordinate frame, but filtering is performed in Cartesian coordinates. Numerical results are given for optimizing the truncation time constant such that a good balance is obtained between the dynamic errors and the standard deviations. Lower bounds on the dynamic errors are established for the Cartesian coordinate linear regression filter and compared with a line-of-sight coordinate Kalman filter."
"Two methods are established for identifying constantcoefficient C2n-type noise-free linear systems if the time response data of the input-output or of all states are known. 2n response data are required to identify an nth-order transfer function or state equation for an unknown linear system. The order of the unknown system can be identified by checking a sequence of determinants. The Z transform and its inversion are mainly used."
"Loran, as an example of a \"hyperbolic\" range difference location system, provides hyperbolic lines of position on which the target must lie. It is shown in this paper that lines of position need not be hyperbolic, i.e., an exact straight line of position on the plane or the surface of a sphere (where the solution is a great circle) is derived and computer-generated error maps are given."
"This paper applies optimal control theory to designing constant gain filters which minimize a weighted average of the filtered variances. Uniaxial second-order motion is studied in detail, and an example is given which indicates that a constant gain filter may be designed with performance comparable to a Kalman filter. An appendix is included which shows how the approach may be extended to higher order systems."
"A method is discussed for tracking the radar cross-section centroid of an ensemble of scatterers, using a raster scan observation technique. Estimation of the mean-squared dimensions of the ensemble is also considered. A maximum permissible beam separation is defined for the scan. Expressions for the bias and variance of the centroid estimates are given. Advantages of the approach are that individual scatterers need not be resolvable, and that the number of beams is independent of the number of scatterers."
"The mapping between function spaces that is implied by the representation of a real \"bandpass\" function by a complex \"low-pass\" function is explicitly emphasized. The discussion is extended to the representation of random processes where the mapping is between spaces of random processes."
"Referring to a previous paper on the subject, this correspondance gives a simple approximate formula for improvement in tracking accuracy that can be obtained by using frequency agility to reduce glint errors. The result turns out to be the smallest of two easily calculated ratios."
"An expression valid for large values of a signal-to-noise ratio is obtained for the covariance of a particular least squares estimate. The quantity estimated is a vector α embodying the direction and speed of a plane wave impinging upon an array of sensors. The method used for calculation differs from that suggested by Levin [1], is thought to be more straightforward, and yields the same results."

"A mathematical model consisting of a homogeneous spherical conductive medium was used to simulate the human head. A current dipole situated in the interior of the sphere produces, on the surface, a theoretical distribution of potential similar to certain EEG activities recorded on the human scalp. We propose a multi-stage method for computing the six parameters of a such virtual dipolar source by using only measurements on the surface of the scalp. Epileptic discharges observed on a young patient were thus analyzed. The computed dipole depends on the placement of pairs of electrodes used for the record. We compare the results of four ``assemblies'' using different pairings of electrodes. The center of the dipole varies within a volume of 2 cm3 but its direction is stable. We discuss the importance and the influence of the approximations introduced by the model and the method. Although these approximations cannot be neglected, they do not change the signification of our results. The question is now raised: Has the virtual source a physical interpretation? Only intracerebral investigations can bring about a clear answer. However, whatever the answer may be, it appears that the method presented here can be helpful in the analysis of EEG surface situations."
"A closed-loop analog computer model for corticosterone dynamics in the male rat is presented in an attempt to examine some existing experimental evidence which suggests contradictory characteristics of the ACTH-glucocorticoid system. First-order compartmental kinetics model the removal of ACTH and corticosterone from the blood. Nonlinear models are used to describe the release of corticosterone by the rat adrenal cortex in response to ACTH in blood, and for the release of ACTH by the anterior pituitary in response to corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) in the hypophyseal portal system. Curve-fitting techniques are used for each system function to adjust the analog to obtain good agreement with laboratory data. The gross characteristics of the neurosecretion of CRF and the resulting ACTH secretion are identified by using portions of the model to simulate various physical experiments."
"A three-dimensional radiographic imaging system has been developed, and is presently being clinically evaluated. Twenty conventional radiographs are reduced and reprojected into a display volume according to a geometry which matches the X-ray source geometry. The images are integrated on a viewing screen and produce the tomographic plane corresponding to the screen's position. Planes parallel and tilted with respect to the scanning plane can be observed by simply adjusting the screen. The image is continuous in all directions, possesses a resolution of about 2lp/mm, and is usually true-sized, although factors of 2 or 3 in magnification can be easily produced."
"In normal vision, eye movements cause the image to move on the retina. Special apparatus can stabilize the image on the retina so it cannot move, and vision fades away. Previous methods for stabilizing the image were either optical systems or complex computer-controlled feedback systems. A simpler feedback system is presented which detects eye motion and rotates a mirror through which the target is viewed, to exactly compensate for eye motion. Unlike previous optical systems, this new system has no lenses in either the viewing or the image-forming path to limit the spatial resolution."
"A procedure is reported for determining vocal-fold closure using a technique of transmitting continuous-wave ultrasound through the larynx. A frequency of 3.2 MHz and an applied acoustic power of less than 1 mV/cm2 was used. Physiological interpretation of received signals is discussed in terms of glottal closure, vocal-fold thickness, vocal-fold vibratory pattern, and thyroid cartilage ossification. Suggestions are offered for choice and arrangement of transducers for this application."
"A mock circulatory system (MCS) was constructed for testing intra-aortic balloon (IAB) temporary heart-assist devices. The MCS consists of a left heart analog, compliant arteries, peripheral resistance, and venous return. Design objectives and operating characteristics of the MCS are presented. The results of a number of studies to determine the effectiveness of intra-aortic balloon devices under conditions of simulated cardiogenic shock are reported."
"A respirator control system based on a variant process model and optimization of system performance is described. The system attempts to minimize the harmful effects of positive pressure ventilation while meeting the ventilatory requirement of the patient. As alveolar pressure is indicative of respiratory dynamics, it has been used as control parameter. Desired alveolar pressure is derived from a fixed parameter RC lung model while actual alveolar pressure is estimated from the variant lung model which is continuously updated through on-line computation of respiratory mechanical parameters. The controller gain is optimally adjusted so as to minimize error index. The system has been simulated on a digital computer and several representative cases of sudden and gradual parameter variation have been studied. It has been shown that in case of changes in the process, the error quickly damps out to zero."
"The distribution of the heating potential generated by an incident electromagnetic plane wave on a conducting sphere simulating the human head was investigated. It was found that for a sphere of 10-cm radius having the same electrical characteristics as those of biological tissues, no hot spots are generated inside. While at lower frequencies the heating is relatively uniform with some polarization effects, for frequencies above 1000 MHz only skin heating takes place. For a sphere of the same size but of conductivity &#x003C3; = 10 mmho/cm (which for f>1000 is lower than that of biological tissues) hot spots occur inside for f>1000 MHz. Intense hot spots also occur inside spheres of radius 5 cm having the same electrical characteristics as those of biological tissues in the frequency region of 250 MHz<f<2800 MHz."
"An electrooptical attachment for an incremental plotter was developed for use with a laboratory computer to provide of digitizing drawings, waveforms, and other graphic Excellent sensitivity was achieved with components than $100. Fiber optics, solid-state devices, and a simple incandescent light source were employed."
"A simple electronic circuit is proposed as an analog of the excitable membrane. It is based on the Hodgkin-Huxley model and their squid axon voltage clamp data. The simulated potassium and sodium conductances are reproduced satisfactorily and the electronic action potentials are very similar to the experimentally recorded ones. Since this analog contains only a few electronic elements, it is small and inexpensive to build. It could be very useful as a means of simulating a wide variety of membrane conductances and different types of action potentials. Also, the simplicity of the circuit makes it an ideal unit to build complex neuron networks."
"Ventricular fibrillation, a form of electrical instability of the myocardium, is strongly suspected to be a significant contributor to ``sudden'' coronary fatalities. Present evidence indicates that ventricular fibrillation is often preceded by other forms of abnormal electrical activity of the heart, especially ventricular premature beats (VPBs). Early detection of the presence of VPBs in the electrocardiogram may be important in making medical decisions to avert a later coronary attack."

  "Medical schools, both newly developing and well-established, are recognizing a need for visual and mechanical instructional aids for teaching medicine to future physicians and paramedical personnel. The analog computer has proved to be very useful for these purposes in our hands, since it can be used to simulate many human and animal functions."
"The on-line interactive-graphics digital-computer model of the normal and congenitally defective heart was developed as a basic research and teaching tool. The interactive graphics capability of the simulation system provides the user great flexibility in selecting the types of defects he wishes to study, and in allowing him to progress at his own speed."
"A third-order model of the cardiovascular system which is designed to illustrate biological system simulation to bioengineering students and to introduce the students to a maximum number of analog computer components is described. The extreme simplicity of the model allows the students to concentrate on the simulation and computation without the additional burden of physiological complexity. Heart pumping action is derived from a variable capacitor, and the systemic circulation is modeled as an RC filter. The data obtained from this model show good correlation with observed data. After presentation of this simple model in class, the students are asked to improve the simulation by including any or all of several improvements which are suggested in this paper."
"A number of complex cardiovascular system models have been developed at the University of Wisconsin largely as a result of bioengineering thesis work carried on in the Department of Electrical Engineering, using a large hybrid computer. Other work in modeling includes parameter estimation study and the development of new methods of modeling. This work has been carried out in collaboration with research workers in Medical and Life Sciences Departments at Wisconsin."
"The present study was prepared in order to illustrate the gas exchange (O2 and CO2) between pulmonary blood and alveolar air. In the model, circulatory and respiratory systems have been separately simulated in order to obtain the driving functions of the interaction model. This last takes into account oxygen and carbon dioxide exchanges between alveolar air and pulmonary blood."
"A simulation of the human speech-production mechanism is described and its application to the area of biomedical teaching is indicated. For the group of students interested in the clinical and scientific areas of speech work, the simulation is particularly useful for showing how various parameters affect speech outputs, and also for helping estimate parameter values that cannot be measured directly. For students of bioengineering, the model and simulation is valuable for illustrating techniques of simplifying complicated physiological systems and actually carrying out the details of a real-world simulation. The model used in our work divides the speech generation into four distinct portions: 1) the lungs-bronchi-trachea which serve as a pressure source; 2) the larynx which provides the oscillatory mechanism; 3) the vocal tract which serves to shape the audible signal produced by the larynx; and 4) the mouth opening which serves to interface the vocal tract with the air outside. Since the above model has been implemented using the IBM System/360 Continuous System Modeling Program (CSMP), it is very easy to demonstrate effects of changing various parameters on the waveshape produced by the system, and to introduce structural changes in the model corresponding to newly obtained physical data or refinements in the mathematical models of the various subsystems. Because CSMP is an application-oriented language, the user can concentrate his efforts on the details of the system he is studying rather than worrying about subtleties of numerical analysis and programming."
"Epidemiological simulation models to be used primarily to augment the teaching of epidemiology to medical students and other individuals concerned with public health and control of epidemics are presented. Interactive simulations are used to expose students to ``realistic'' epidemic situations and permit them to experiment with various control strategies. Criteria by which simulations for such teaching purposes may be evaluated are proposed and operating simulations, MEASLES and INFLU, are described in detail. Information is provided regarding user experience with the above simulations."
"A simple problem in epidemiology is described. The purpose is to demonstrate how computers, analog im this paper, can be used to assist the student in visualizing a complex system. The very act of creating the necessary equations to describe a system forces the experimenter to crystallize his understanding of the system. When, and usually if, the computer simulation does not match the data, the investigator must revise his model. Several iterations result in a more accurate understanding of the system being studied. The analog computer is a handy tool for performing rapid parameter studies and model revisions at low cost. More scientific investigators need exposure to the advantages of small low-cost computers."
"In the study of biophysical systems, the need for simulation often arises because a system may be better defined by assuming that the simulation model characterizes certain properties of the real system. Techniques of digital simulation and dynamic analogies, which offer much greater possibilities for quantitative analysis and synthesis of complex biological and physical systems, have become important and versatile tools. The advent and development of problem-oriented computer languages have made the simulation analysis a convenient and powerful method of problem solving and design in the diversified fields of biological engineering. Practical guides to the idealization, simplification, formulation, and analysis of biophysical systems, as well as application of computer-simulation models and routines, are discussed."
"Some of the earliest biological system models used to guide the affairs of man were employed to avoid the ``bends'' in diving. A brief discussion of decompression sickness, as it can affect tunnel workers, airplane pilots, or divers, is given, along with an analog computer configuration to represent the situation. The configuration itself has proved helpful in aiding engineers to understand some of the mechanisms involved, and the recordings that result seem helpful in supplying to physiologists and divers a feeling for the probable effect of a change in circumstances associated with a proposed dive. The effect of changing a gas mixture or changing the time course of a dive is readily visualized, for example, as are the results of using a continuously variable gas mixture and continuous ascent for minimum decompression time."
"Although often neglected in bioinstrumentation courses, direct calorimetry has important biomedical, biophysical, and clinical implications. Since direct calorimeters are usually considered somewhat esoteric, a simplified analysis of their design and operation is useful. Therefore, an electrical analog of the thermopile lattice common to most direct calorimeters was developed. This model can be used to derive the transfer function of the direct calorimeter, and through digital computer simulation, can aid in the design of specialized instruments. Engineering students can readily understand and use this model making the study of direct calorimetry practical in a teaching context."
"This report has been prepared by past and present members of the Engineering in Biology and Medicine Training Committee in response to a request from the Research Training Grants Branch, NIGMS. It represents the best effort of this group to project the national manpower needs in biomedical engineering during the decades to come and to assess the impact of different types of federal support of graduate training in biomedical engineering. The Committee believes that, although there may be an apparent oversupply of biomedical engineering Ph.D.'s during the next year or two, in the longer range the need for biomedical engineers at all educational levels will meet or exceed the capacity of the nation's educational system to produce them. This view depends, however, on the assumption that certain changes will take place, both in the biomedical engineering industry and in the universities. The Committee concludes that a balanced collection of several means for governmental support of biomedical engineering graduate students is both appropriate and necessary."
"A vector relationship similar to Green's theorem incorporating simplifications which can be made for impedance plethysmography is derived. The mathematics involved are simplified by the use of current density instead of electric field. Geselowitz's lead theory result [1] is rederived and a limitation of such proofs is discussed."
"A multisensory conversational learning facility is described which permits the visually handicapped to share the process and content of instruction of sighted persons. The blind student receives live or recorded audio and graphic instruction synchronously via his aural and tactile/kinesthetic senses. A novel kinesthetic terminal for the blind is described which permits ``visual'' perception of kinetic graphics. In the classroom the blind student perceives blackboard graphics concurrently with the instructor's live presentation; in the self-instruction mode he connects to a remote bank of audiographic instructional materials and receives lessons via telephone through a combined audio/kinesthetic terminal. The conversational learning system which serves simultaneously varying numbers of blind and sighted learners is controlled by a mini-computer. Applications of the audio/kinesthetic terminal in education of sighted persons and in research on information processes of the blind are briefly noted."
"Linear potentiometers and approximation circuits have been employed in a simple and inexpensive device which accurately reproduces the contour of a patient to within ±2 mm. Reliable measurement of patient contours is necessary for accurate dosimetry in radiation therapy treatments."

 "One goal of digital processing of radiographic images is to provide the radiologist with quantitative measurements of human anatomy as well as an indication as to whether or not this anatomy is within normal limits. A computer algorithm is described, designed to automatically detect, extract quantitative measurements from, and diagnose the cardiac projection present in full-size anteriorview chest radiographs. A normal-abnormal diagnosis is demonstrated utilizing abnormal data from five classes of heart disease. In addition, normal-abnormal as well as normal-differential diagnoses are demonstrated for the rheumatic heart disease class. A feature extraction algorithm is developed using several ad hoc techniques, some of which were adapted from other feature extraction uses. The extracted features are classified into diagnostic classes using linear and quadratic discriminant functions. A concurrent study of physician diagnostic accuracy is also undertaken using the averaged diagnostic rates of ten radiologists on a representative subset of the radiographs used in the computer study."
"A brief description of the standard rotating tomographic collimator and a new magnifying tomographic collimator is given. The geometry of the apparatus is quantitatively described and the modulation transfer characteristics for the standard apparatus and for various configurations of the proposed system using various source frequencies and planar depths are calculated. The smearing function for a line source is also calculated. It is shown that planar depth resolution can be improved at the expense of decreasing geometric efficiency. The advantages of using a magnifying collimator in the tomographic scheme are discussed."
"Holography has emerged from the laboratory and is slowly becoming a useful tool in a variety of engineering and scientific areas. The potential exists for holography to serve as such a tool in medical and biological research. Holography can be used to form three-dimensional images. Three dimensionality is a consequence of the recording of phase information in the hologram. The presence of phase information in holographic images makes them extremely versatile and amenable to such a posteriori techniques as interferometry and dark-field imagery. Holography can also be used to analyze images, that is, to enhance image contrast and resolution, or to perform such functions as correlation analyses and pattern recognition. Moreover, the versatility of holography extends beyond the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum; holograms made with infrared, ultraviolet, microwave, or ultrasonic illumination, or ``synthetic'' holograms made using a computer can be used to produce visible images or to analyze nonvisible images. The manner in which holography's potential can be used in biomedical applications is discussed."
"A dynamic lumped-parameter model for pulmonary gas transport has been developed to characterize the lung and predict the effect of various parameter changes. The gas side of the lung is modeled as a series and parallel arrangement of five perfectly mixed, variable-volume compartments that correspond roughly to airway and alveolar regions. The blood side of the lung is modeled as a series of perfectly mixed, constant-volume compartments that represent the pulmonary capillary bed. From nonsteady mass balances, equations are derived which yield the time course of concentration for each compartment. Model simulations indicate that the oxygen-hemoglobin reaction does not reach equilibrium in the pulmonary capillaries, an assumption commonly made in analyses of pulmonary oxygen transport. Simulations also show the extent to which breathing amplitude and rate can affect the oxygen level in the blood leaving the lung. A comparison of simulations for a normal state and chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD) with identical input conditions demonstrates that the oxygen level in the blood leaving the lung is much lower in COLD. Also, the simulations are compared with experimental findings."
"To develop a measurement technique for microvascular stiffness and resistance, an iterative algorithm (NOLESQ) combining steepest descent and Taylor series (Gauss-Newton) methods was used to estimate model parameters to provide a minimal least squares error at 5-ms intervals of the predicted blood flow to the measured flow. Renal arterial pressure and flow data of high dynamic and static accuracy were used. The data were in blocks of 2500 values each (12.5-s samples). A reasonable fit was obtained with only three parameters: arterial conductance, compliance, and a steady pressure at or just beyond the glomerulae. Other models, incorporating large artery resistance, blood mass, pressure dependent conductance, and pressure dependent compliance were studied. Criteria for acceptance were reasonable values from prior knowledge of biological materials, similarity of parameter values between consecutive samples and between animals, convergence, and error of fit reduced to the noise level of the input data."
"Encouraging progress has been made recently with a multiple-dipole type of inverse electrocardiographic procedure. A vitally important feature of the procedure is constraint of equivalent dipole moments to nonnegative values by means of quadratic programming. Application of the method to data derived from purely clinical sources has great heuristic value, but suffers from the lack of undisputed baseline information against which to compare the results of inverse solution. Accordingly, in this paper we attempt to evaluate the dependability of fixed-dipole array inversion by applying the method to a series of accurately modeled situations. Generally acceptable results are obtained with the dipoles arrayed in ``favorable'' configurations, with considerably less acceptable outcome likely under ``unfavorable'' conditions. Superposition of signal noise or perturbation of equivalent dipole locations tends to degrade the quality of solution, but does not entirely vitiate it. Study of one unfavorable array shows how a competitive situation might occur which could cause ``crosstalk'' between the interventricular septum and the free wall of the right ventricle. Despite the quantitative deficiencies which become apparent when multiple-dipole inversion is essayed with accurately modeled data, the procedure continues to offer promise as a useful means of extracting intrinsic electrophysiologic information from electrocardiographic signals."
"Pediatric defibrillator paddles for infants and small children have been designed for a dc defibrillator. Studies in dogs, in which paddles ranging from 3 to 9 cm in diameter were used, suggested that 5-cm paddles were optimal from the standpoint of minimal myocardial damage, skin burns, and deviation of the delivered energy from that shown by the meter of the defibrillator. Transthoracic resistance was found to be inversely related to paddle diameter according to the equation R =(450/d) -7.32, where R represents the transthoracic resistance in ohms and d represents the diameter of paddles in cm. The effect of paddle size on the peak transthoracic voltage, current, and total delivered energy is presented. Use of paddles smaller than 5 cm was associated with discharge of damagingly high voltage and current densities. The effectiveness and relative safety of the 5-cm pediatric paddle are discussed. Even though conclusions reached relative to an optimal paddle size for small patients should be restricted to the dc defibrillator used in these studies, the reported general technique and design procedure should have general applicability in the design of pediatric paddles for other types of defibrillators."
"The in vivo power output of implantable power sources using porous platinum- or palladium-black cathodes is approximately four to five times greater than ones using commercially available cathodes of platinum black dispersed in Teflon. Porous electrodes produce a much lower foreign-body reaction than electrodes with plastic binders. Comparison of BET surface-area measurements for the powders and compacted electrodes illustrate that there is an approximate 20-percent decrease in surface area following compaction. The particle size, distribution, and shape of the powders were studied with the aid of scanning electromicrographs. In vitro galvanostatic measurements were made on the implantable power sources to study the electrochemical activity before implantation."
"The capabilities and limitations of electrocardiography and magnetocardiography are discussed. Representing the electrical activity of the heart by an impressed current density ji, electrocardiography determines the spherical harmonic multipole expansion of its divergence (flux source), while magnetocardiography determines the spherical harmonic multipole expansion of the radial component of its curl (vortex source)."
"A technique for photographing the ensemble effects of a series of evoked neuronal unit responses is described. The use of a counting register and a digital-to-analog converter to step the sweep after each stimulus obviates the need for a moving-film type of camera. Pattern height remains constant for any preselected number of sweeps, and for changes in stimulus frequency as well. Provision is also included for presentation of unit discharges in dot form or unit slow-wave activity in analog form."
"A special operating table for cats has been developed. It maintains the body weight within ±5 gm by means of a built-in load transducer system controlling an infusion pump. The table has a conventional temperature control."
"Restoration of volitional control of the micturition reflex requires the use of bladder volume sensors. A method of measuring bladder volume by monitoring local distension has been developed in the laboratory. Tests conducted in experimental animals yielded 15 percent accuracy with bladder volume at micturition reflex threshold."
"A simple cardiac monitoring system (called the disaster alarm) is described in this short communication. The system provides a simplified form of cardiac monitoring for patients on regular hospital wards who do not require continuous observation."
"A device to produce displacement step pulses for studying viscoelastic wave propagation in biological specimens was developed on the basis of condenser discharge through a solenoid. The amplitude and rise time of the pulse step can be adjusted by varying the condenser capacity, charging voltage, and distance between the armature and the electromagnet."

"A method for determining the essential parameters of the aorta, namely the geometric taper, area, hoop elasticity, and effective loss factor, from in vivo pressure measurements is presented. A nonuniform hybrid model, having both geometric and elastic taper and terminated in a reflectionless impedance at the femoral bifurcation, is utilized."
"An automated constant cuff-pressure system to remotely determine average human blood pressure levels was developed to overcome problems in measurement caused by natural beat-to-beat fluctuations in arterial pressure."
"The inverse problem in electrocardiography is attacked via the development of a model appropriate for the computation of epicardial potentials from a knowledge of heart and torso geometry as well as surface potentials. The model takes the form of an integral equation of the first kind in which the kernel is interpreted as a Green's function. A theoretical investigation of system independence in the presence of error is developed, and two techniques for the theoretical consideration of system independence are examined. Application of these two techniques to concentric spherical systems indicates that spheres with ratios of inner-to-outer radii less than 0.5 contain less than twenty independent parameters in the presence of realistic noise levels. The number of independent parameters deteriorates rapidly as this ratio falls below 0.5. These results suggest that it is not feasible to determine epicardial potentials from torso potentials by using unconstrained solutions."
"The application of digital filtering techniques to correct for the instrumental error, known as ``smearing,'' which occurs when a long catheter of narrow bore is used to sample the concentration of an indicator substance dissolved in blood, is described."
"The simulation of a system to perform an automated leukocyte differential has been achieved through the measurement of certain features or parameters on the cell image. Using photomicrographs on Kodachrome II-A film of Wright's stained leukocytes, the following four features have successfully separated five normal cell types (neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte): 1) nucleus size; 2) nucleus color; 3) cytoplasm size; 4) cytoplasm color."
 "Passage of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968 marked the beginning of a new era in the relationship between Federal health authorities and the electronic products industry. The Act establishes the authority of the Federal government to issue radiation safety performance standards for commercial electronic products and to require manufacturers to correct product defects relating to radiation safety."
"Biophysical principles which relate to the interaction of microwaves to biological material and man are summarized. The limitations of animal experimentation and the usefulness of biophysical considerations are indicated, and the absorption of microwaves by tissues is discussed."
"Various types of human injury attributable to nonionizing radiations are presented. Because of the unique combination afforded by the optical qualities of the eye and by the differential diagnostic features of resultant ocular pathology, an ophthalmological examination frequently can provide the signature indicating whether visible or invisible radiations produced the injury. For example, visible radiations principally result in various forms of macular photoretinitis and retinal burn or detachment or chorioretinal melanomata; whereas, invisible radiations principally produce thermal types of cataract or uveitis. Other systemic injuries and effects are also discussed. A rationale is submitted in support of a new concept, elastic membrane fatigue, as an etiological factor for otherwise inexplicable findings, such as the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, which parallels the increased ambient levels of electronic smog found in urban environments."
"Stimulation of nervous tissue by means of an induced electric field produced by a contactless device is described. The unit is unique because it lends itself to surgical implantation."
"An electronic system is described that distinguishes and tabulates pressure pulses received from the Resusci-Anne training mannequin during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The requirements of this system are in accordance with accepted CPR training programs. Samples of quantitative data gathered during mannequin practice sessions are included. The effectiveness of the system as a teaching aid is investigated, and correlations are made between CPR skills and a trainee's physical attributes."
"A small, inexpensive, integrated circuit, asymmetric, triangle generator for the calibration of cardiovascular waveform differentiators is described. The calibrator produces a simulated pressure waveform in which the slopes of the leading and trailing edges are precisely and stably set to represent specific values of dP/dt in millimeters of mercury per second. The waveform is clipped to give a zero output when differentiated, facilitating setting the baseline and the gain of the differentiating amplifier used to record the first derivative."
"An inexpensive EKG telephone transmitter is described that can facilitate remote monitoring of potential cardiac patients. It can be particularly useful in automated mass-screening programs, battery-life pacemaker studies, and routine but short-term rhythm sampling. An alternate version incorporates touch-tone capability to allow operation with an unattended computerized monitoring facility."

"In order to deliver reasonable health care to all people, it is essential that standards be established. Standards vary with the type of control and with the approach desired in determining the quality of care. This paper discusses various kinds of standards and their application in the health care field. Standards may be determined as a process or as a direct regulation. It is probable that regulation of standards by process is the most satisfactory method."
"A telemetry system for long-term monitoring of the blood pressure of unrestrained animals is described. The wholly implantable transmitter is equipped with a pressure transducer suitable for chronic intravascular use. To achieve high performance and long battery life, a greater number of components were used than in conventional implantable devices. Pulse interval modulation is used with a mean sampling rate significantly higher than twice the maximum signal frequency. Together with a controlled pulse window in the receiver, an effective reduction of ignition spark interferences with the weak transmitted signal could therewith be achieved."
"A new solid-state device has been developed for the measurement of ion activities in electrochemical and biological environments. One can recognize in the device the properties of both a glass electrode and a field-effect transistor. This justifies the name ion-sensitive field-effect transistor. The device makes it possible to measure ion activities without using a reference electrode. For its application, a special electronic circuit is described. Results of measured Na+ and H+ ion activities are given in detail. As an example for electrophysiological application, results are shown of recorded extracellular ion pulses measured with a guinea pig taenia coli."
"A three-dimensional finite difference computer simulation has been used to model entire intracranial fields from a known dipole generator in both a cat brain and an insulated cube. The model permits pointwise variation of conductivity coincident with intracranial inhomogeneities due to gray and white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and bone. Adequacy of the model was verified by agreement between the computed results and those obtained in the cube with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous media and in the cat brain along the dipole axis. Variation of brain model parameters showed that neither increasing nor abolishing intracranial inhomogeneities would give differences great enough to be detected experimentally. On the other hand, the position of the boundary could have significant effects on the fields. The model is general enough to be applicable to a variety of multipole generators and generator locations, as well as permitting consideration of the influence of localized inhomogeneities."
"A neural network model is introduced which approximates the behavior of an integrator. It is developed from cells that are physiologically realistic. Requirements for insensitivity of network function to cell threshold distribution are derived, and network performance as the forward-path element of a neuromuscular control system is analyzed. The response of the ``integrator'' to sustained inputs is derived and shown to approximate the desired proportionality of input magnitude and rate of change of output. Finally, deviations from physiological realism are discussed and the visual accommodation system is described as an example of a biological servomechanism in which a neural integrator seems probable."
"The construction of a lightweight quadrifillar needle electrode offering four monopolar and six bipolar microelectrode combinations is described. The electrode has three useful features: 1) it can record distinct individual motor unit action potentials during strong muscle contractions, 2) the frequency response curve of the electrode can be altered to a simple functional relationship within the frequency range of myoelectric signals, and 3) the electrode minimizes the subject's discomfort."
"The importance of diffusion phenomena in glass micropipettes filled with concentrated electrolyte solutions is well known. Nonequilibrium diffusion-rate equations for electrolyte-filled glass micropipettes are given for a model of situations of current interest: diffusion into an infinite medium. The solutions of these equations give the flux of material out of a micropipette as a function of time, concentration, and geometry."
"A dual-window video densitometer was developed for the measurement of dimensions of televised scenes. Filter and hold circuitry used to convert the output into analog signals proportional to the dimension being measured obviate the use of specialized computers. The system was utilized to study the change of dimension of the in vivo human heart."
"Preparations for and results of a democratic expression of opinion by 15 scientists who ranked 29 potential research topics according to the priorities they perceived in April 1970 forbasic research on diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasonic radiation are reported. Recommendations are included on methods of funding and on the design, conduct, and reporting of such research. This paper is intended to be of interest to established workers in the field, recent graduates seeking research topics, and program directors of funding agencies."
"An attempt to quantitate the organization of the human uterus was made by measuring the maximum amplitude and the maximum and minimum slopes of the intrauterine pressure waveform prior to induced labor and during spontaneous and induced labors. No apparent differences in the ratio of the maximum amplitude to the maximum and minimum slopes were found in these three physiological states. All the correlation coefficients for the maximum amplitude and maximum (r1) and minimum (r2) slopes were high, r1, ranging from 0.79-0.84, and r2 from 0.72-0.80. Possible use of these measures in the further analysis of the organization of uterine contractility is discussed."
"An exact solution inside, outside, and within two arbitrary concentric spherical shells is presented for an impinging monochromatic linearly polarized electromagnetic wave. Specifically, the solution was found for a double-shell spherical acrylic plastic enclosure irradiated with 2450-MHz microwaves. The enclosure is used as an environmentally controlled exposure chamber for experimental animals during microwave irradiation. The analysis shows that an air foamed material, such as styrofoam, would be a better material than either Plexiglas or Teflon, provided it is sufficiently durable."
"A multipurpose electronic filter and integrating level detector suitable for electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic recording and analysis is described. It uses solid-state components and is easily constructed. An application of the device in the detection of slow wave sleep (SWS) potentials is given."
"The feasibility of using quasi-linearization for obtaining solutions to the inverse problem in electrocardiography is investigated. Results suggest that convergence is unlikely when using real electrocardiographic data."

"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques have been applied to the measurement of steady or quasi-steady flow by using, principally, the tag-detect method. This paper describes a two-magnet NMR flowmeter that can be used to measure pulsatile flow. The pulsatile nature of the flow causes a pulsed magnetization of the fluid, which is detected by a flow-sensitive NMR detector. A parabolic velocity profile has been assumed. The results of theoretical computations closely approximate in vitro data from a 1.6-mm ID rigid tube with respect to the shape of the NMR signal and to the proportionality of the NMR signal amplitude to flow rate. Selected in vivo results are also presented."
"Most investigations of visual evoked potentials monitored at the human scalp have utilized the average of a series of responses recorded from a single subject in a specific population to define components of the visual evoked response (VER). While this technique provides a fairly consistent estimate of an individual's average VER, it is not uncommon to obtain quite dissimilar averages from different subjects under identical experimental conditions. This contrast in the VER estimates across a population has hindered the interpretation of the effects of stimulus parameters on the VER and frustrated the attempt to use this average for clinical diagnosis."
"The problem of output for reading machines for the blind is discussed and it is concluded that speech is essential if reading rates greater than 80 words/min are desired. Means for achieving this are considered to be dependent on the design of a cheap compact data store. Assuming that monotonic telephone-quality speech would be acceptable, the minimum storage capacity for normal reading speeds is shown to be 6 × 10-6 bits, if speech synthesis is not used."
"This paper describes a simple automated procedure for counting the number n of alveoli per unit area of human lung tissue."
"Median nerve afferent action potentials can be recorded at the wrist in response to a current pulse applied to the index and middle fingers. Latencies of such action potentials have diagnostic value; however, because of difficulties in recording techniques, such latency measurements have not been used widely in clinical environments. A recording technique with very little stimulus artifact is presented."
"On-line dynamic experiments on skeletal muscle vascular resistance require an extensive number of simple calculations in order to derive the data. A low-cost analog computer is described which utilizes perfusion pressure, venous flow, and muscle weight to calculate vascular resistance per 100 gm of muscle weight. This computer has been in use with the isolated perfused canine gracilis muscle preparation and has been shown to have considerable merit in reducing calculations and permitting immediate evaluation of the experimental data. A drop rate meter is incorporated in the device for the calculation of venous flow; perfusion pressure is obtained from a standard commercial transducer. A block diagram is included, and typical data are shown which illustrate the usefulness of continuous on-line calculation of resistance."

   "MAN is but a part of the universe; his capabilities make him a significant link, in the cycle of life. To ensure this life, man must live in harmony with his environment. Recently, a disharmony has been discovered which could have grave effects upon the existence of man. It appears that man in his great thrust forward is destroying his own environment. The gravity of this threat to man's own existence carries some intrinsic problems of its own: man must allow his reason rather than his emotion to take command."
"A brief picture of one of the newer advances in the art of digital logic is given. The advantages of high threshold integrated circuits is covered along with their use in digital logic control applications pertaining to materials handling. Topics covered are basic logic functions and counter and shift register applications."
"A method to combine a thyristor switch with a rubbing contact distributor in order to produce a polyphase square-wave output from a dc supply is described. The switch operates sequentially on each phase and is rated at a fraction of the total output of the converter. An experimental converter was used to study the problems of transferring the static switch from phase to phase without sparking under various loading conditions. A successful 6-kW laboratory converter was evolved, capable of operation on inductive and resistive load from 50-Hz to zero output frequency with a high efficiency. The economic features of the system and its application are discussed."
"General techniques for installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting variable-speed drives are presented. In all cases the actual drive manufacturer's instruction manual and wiring diagrams should be utilized for final analysis and detailed information. Installation and periodic maintenance techniques will cover some specific hardware. However, a systematic approach will be utilized in the troubleshooting area."
"There are, at present, forces operating in the real world that demand a vigorous enlightened appraisal by any profit-oriented textile company. In addition to such widely publicized forces as increased foreign and domestic competition and rising costs, there are the problems of getting, training, and keeping an adequate staff of electrical-electronic maintenance personnel. Some of these personnel problems are defined, and some solutions are suggested."
 "The application of digital techniques to program and to process the input signals to adjustable-frequency inverters for the control of rugged ac motors is becoming widespread. It was perhaps inevitable that digital signal control would eventually be combined with the inherently digital adjustable-frequency power inverter to produce systems having high overall line speed accuracy, adjustable ``digital gearing'' between sections, locked-in-step acceleration from creep to run speed, and in-train digital jogging. A short introduction to adjustable-frequency motor control is given, and the use of digital techniques for controlling adjustable-frequency inverters to produce digital speed systems is described. Early applications of the first solid-state inverters to synthetic fiber spinning and their continued use is described. Specific current applications of digitally controlled adjustable-frequency speed systems are discussed, and potential applications that demonstrate how the capabilities of such systems can be used to provide economic solutions to many textile industry drive problems are reviewed."
"Time sharing enables many businessmen, engineers, and scientists to share the use of remote computers over regular telephone lines from a terminal in their office. The process is described, and a brief history of its development is presented."
"Mill drives for the cement industry have rapidly increased in horsepower during the past few years. There appears to be no limit in size. Because of this increase in horsepower, the application problems have become more complex. The usual type of mill drives may not provide the optimum performance and cost. Nonconventional drives should be included in the evaluation. The significant types of drives available are reviewed, and the electrical performance and economics of each type are evaluated. Gearless-type drives are in the study. Gearing, however, is not included in the evaluation. No attempt is made to recommend one drive over any other."
"With the expanding market for glass, the advent of strict pollution control, and the shortage and increasing cost of natural gas, the interest in electric melting has heightened dramatically in the past few years. Most of this interest to date has centered on the technical aspects such as control, element and furnace design, etc. The factors of power cost in melting are evaluated. A discussion of typical utility rates, an analysis of the electric melting load, and the integration of that load with a normal glass plant load are included. A basis for determining incremental melting costs is established and possibilities for reducing power costs discussed."
"Three general problem areas are considered. They are electrode immersion length, parallel electrode effects, and power density distribution. Use is made of data from operating furnaces, water models, and mathematical analysis."
"Ultrasonic detection of electrical corona discharge has become an important and useful tool for the detection of faulty insulators. The ultrasonic test unit consists of a hand-held probe-microphone responsive to acoustic energy in the 36-to 44-kHz range and is battery powered. Solid-state electronics translate high-frequency sonics to the audible range and provide amplification through a speaker or headset. The characteristics associated with a phenomenon are preserved through translation. Energy released at 40 kHz by corona or arcing is recognizable as the familiar ``frying'' sound. Similarly, air pressure leaks emit ``hissing'' sounds at 40 kHz. Application of this principal has resulted in the replacement of numerous insulators before occurrence of serious electrical failures. Minute inspections and tests revealed porcelain cracks and mechanical imperfections that would have eventually resulted in critical electrical faults. Similarly, leaks have been eliminated in compressed air systems, thereby reducing compressor service demands."
"The standard SCR dimmer, like all phase controlled dimmers, produces a distorted output waveform. When this waveform is applied to an incandescent lamp, the lamp emits an audible hum that in certain applications is intolerable. To reduce lamp acoustical noise, most lighting control manufacturers place a large inductor in series with the lamp. An alternate approach is the reverse phase controlled dimmer. Instead of inductors, it utilizes auxiliary commutated SCR with capacitor commutation circuitry to limit lamp noise. Two advantages are offered by this approach. First, eliminating the large inductor allows the dimmer to be greatly reduced in size. Secondly, elimination of the inductor makes more power available to the load. The cause of lamp acoustical noise, the design of the reverse phase controlled dimmer, and methods for measuring lamp noise are described."
"A brief description of the WABCO/Reliance-pulse-width modulation (PWM) propulsion system and its potential operational advantages are presented. PWM system performance and early operating experience on Cleveland Transit System (CTS) car no. 154 are reviewed. CTS no. 154 is a modern ``airporter'' car that has been retrofitted with engineering prototype inverter and control packages. It is running on the transit system to evaluate propulsion system performance and reliability. This car and the earlier breadboard experimental car, CTS no. 169, are the only known transit vehicles using ac induction motors."

 "The survival of industry requires the use of new technology which embraces visual and total environment-these are dominated by illumination. The direct correlation between better and more economical lighting conditions and the increase in production, improvement in attitude, the availability of workers, and working efficiency, are illustrated by case histories and pictures. Consideration of the effects of environment on man is looked upon as the key to success that has taken place in many companies and the hopes of the future for others."
"A redundant static inverter is applied as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). A reliability analysis is presented showing that the introduction of a static bypass transfer switch brings about a reliability improvement of 8.5 to 1 in the mean time between failure (MTBF). This gives MTBF greater than 600 000 h. The static bypass transfer switch provides a synchronized automatic transfer in less than 1 ms from the UPS to the normal ac input power source upon a failure of the UPS."
"A technology foundation paper on thermoelectric cooling and air conditioning, presenting basic theory and system design parameters is presented with some discussion of applications."
"The ac converter system discussed involves a design concept that results in a total cost that is competitive with dc converter systems when applied to specific application requirements. The particular application used as a reference is the limited speed range, constant horsepower grinder. This application may be satisfied by a constant voltage, adjustable frequency converter, and motor combination. First, the application requirements are presented. Next, the discussion covers satisfaction of these requirements by means of specific design as to minimize cost. Finally, other unusual aspects of the system are presented, such as the method of modifying the motor voltage during acceleration, the requirement for high voltage output, and a unique packaging design to satisfy the severe ambient conditions of the application."
"DC chopper propulsion speed control is attained by a solid-state switch whose variable on-off duty cycle transfers a proportional quantity of pulsed energy into a motor. The pulsed battery current is alternately stored and expended within the dc motor and its series connected dc choke during each period of conduction and succeeding freewheeling operating mode. Hence an energy transfer is maintained transforming a high voltage low dc supply into a lower voltage higher dc demanding load. The transformation ratio is considered a controlled variable by simply controlling the on-off conduction duty cycle of its solid-state switch. This simplistic approach, however, fails to recognize that the instantaneous battery current amplitude equals the motor current demand during the switch ``on'' period resulting in potentially very large peak power demands [1]."
"Since its introduction in the mid 1960's the pulsewidth modulated (PWM) inverter has offered a number of significant advantages over other inverter types for low and medium frequency applications. The generation of an acceptable waveform at higher frequency, however, was limited by the characteristics of available power thyristors and modulator design. With the advent of the fast turn-off thyristor and advances in PWM modulator techniques, the PWM inverter now offers application advantages to 200 Hz. PWM design considerations are analyzed, with a discussion of second-generation PWM operation provided."
"Digital measurement is described, and its importance to the raw mill operation is discussed. The systems that can make use of digital measurement are also considered."
 "Some control problems in textile processes require or can justify a control computer in lieu of conventional type of control. How then should the typical user approach the selection and implementation of a system. The user must evaluate 1) buying the mini and applying it himself, 2) buying the mini from one vendor and system application from a ``software house,'' and 3) buying the computer and programming as an engineered control system from one vendor at what may initially appear to be a premium price. He will soon learn that the ``mini'' price tag balloons as he decides to actually do something with the basic box. Considerations of hardware, control oriented software and process-computer interface are discussed. Flexibility, reliability, and expandability of hardware and software as well as vendor experience and services offered are key features which should be evaluated as related to user's current needs."
"Glass batching, the process in which raw materials are stored, weighed, mixed, and delivered to glass melting furnaces, was modernized with small dedicated digital computers. The modernized glass batch plant includes the direct control of twenty-one scales, weighing 136 000 kg (150 tons)/h for nine glass container furnaces. The computer system improved the weighing accuracy, increased the potential material through-put, and provided greater flexibility of operation."
"Recent advances in both design technology and installation techniques of optical flame detectors have now made possible and practical the reliable use of flame failure detection systems for burners used on glass melting tanks and annealing lehrs. This paper will cover the operating characteristics of various types of flame detectors and a description of flame safeguard control systems as applied in the glass manufacturing process. In addition, we have prepared a review of current industry recommendations and insurance underwriters' requirements for burner safeguard systems for the glass industry."
"The sizing of primary substations, distribution voltage selection, power-factor correction techniques, and unit substation sizes are discussed for general manufacturing facilities' power distribution. These areas are explored with respect to the specific requirements of a tire manufacturing plant."
"The requirement for transforming dc power from one voltage level to another, and processing this power for compatibility with the load exists in many industrial and vehicular applications."
"In many applications where battery powered drives are used, high efficiency, low cost, and low weight are of prime importance. Such applications include electric vehicles, fork-lift trucks, submarines, etc."
"The critical need to improve our environment has caused renewed interest in vehicles propelled by electric or hybrid electric power plants [1]. Electric traction drives form the pivotal element in such a system. They are also gaining wide acceptance in other vehicular applications."
"The dc chopper-controlled car, offering numerous merits, is expected to introduce many advantages. However, from the beginning there has been apprehension that the chopper-controlled car may develop harmonic currents in the catenary system and inductively interfere with other electric equipment. Harmonics in an overhead wire system caused by dc chopper-controlled cars was examined, and the relationship of circuit element values and chopper operation to harmonic currents was theoretically analyzed. Results of inductive interference tests with a prototype chopper-controlled car nearly agreed with the result of this theoretical analysis. Practical conditions wherein dc chopper-controlled cars were fully adopted and run in accordance with standard running curves were further simulated, and a program to obtain harmonics in an overhead wire system by using a computer is developed. It was found that the simulated equivalent interference current, even under the worst condition, is only 20 percent larger than the maximum equivalent interference current of one train and can be sufficiently suppressed by appropriate filtering."
"IT is essential to maintain the integrity of electrical substation apparatus and associated equipment to ensure the availability of uninterrupted power. Cement plants must maintain continuous production and avoid the high cost of unscheduled interruptions. Periodic substation surveys will determine the integrity of the equipment. Where the condition of apparatus and porcelain insulators are less than satisfactory, service can usually be accomplished without power interruption. The integrity of porcelain insulators is of special importance because of the nature of contamination prevailing in the area of a cement plant. Metal oxides and sulphides adhere to the insulator and become an electrolyte in water, thereby increasing leakage currents to dangerous levels where flashover can occur in the event of high voltage transients. Flashover of the insulator can cause damage to the insulator, damage to apparatus, and interruption to service."
"New types of direct burial cable, associated devices, and methods, coupled with ecological pressures, have resulted in phenomenal growth of underground power distribution. Applications are going far beyond previous industrial and residential development use. Often loop or alternate feeds are not available, particularly in rural radial systems. Rapid service restoration may depend upon cable tracing and fault location. The proliferation of under-ground utilities with increasing possibility of excavation damage makes on-site route tracing and depth finding highly desirable. The ready availability of suitable tracing and fault locating equipment in the hands of trained personnel becomes of greater importance as installations multiply."

 "Recurring reports of arcing ground fault burndowns have generated a considerable amount of interest in the subject on the part of those individuals who are responsible for the design of power systems. In fact the interest is so widespread that as one consequence, article 230-95 of the 1972 edition of the National Electrical Code requires that service entrance devices of specific types be equipped with additional ground fault protection."
"A great amount of information and opinion has been written about grounding versus ungrounding low-voltage systems, but no magic application formula has arisen. Each system design decision must be made on an individual system basis modified by planned plant operating procedures. Because of the number of circuit devices involved, economics, and the integrity of electrical apparatus, the decision on extent of application of ground detecting equipment is difficult. A single suggestion to cover all system ground protection questions is impossible. Without firm assurances from the operating management for continued availability of skilled and experienced maintenance personnel, the authors would favor the solidly grounded system utilizing sensitive protection devices for isolation of low-level-and above-ground faults."
"The strength and fracture characteristics of tempered glass are dependent on the temperature/time relationship of the glass during the heating and cooling operations. This paper describes the use of radiation pyrometers embodying appropriate filters to measure and control the glass temperature so as to achieve consistently the required characteristics in the tempered glass."
"The winder can be the most difficult component to specify when the operational requirements for a processing line are being generated. When choosing a windup system, size, accuracy, required range of control, and cost must be considered. If these factors are kept in proper perspective, an optimized system can be selected to produce a rewound roll with the characteristics required for in-or out-plant handling."
"A single-phase 5-kW 120-V demonstration model switching system which utilizes power transistors and does not require power source synchronization has been developed and laboratory evaluated. This model accomplishes load transfer between two independent power sources at any phase angle and in less than 20 µs. The utilization of this system in investigating the effects of asynchronous switching on a limited number of electronic equipment indicated that such equipment can tolerate high-speed power source asynchronous switching."
"The thyristor inverter induction motor drive devised, analyzed, and experimentally evaluated in this investigation has a new thyristor commutating technique where the dc bus current is interrupted periodically by a thyristor dc switch to commutate all the inverter thyristors."
"An equivalent circuit of an induction machine in complex frequency domain is presented. This can be used to predetermine the performance of induction machine supplied with balanced nonsinusoidal voltages without obtaining the harmonic components of the supply voltage waveform as in classical approach. Moreover, a transfer admittance function has been defined between the line current and the line voltage of an induction machine with star- or delta-connected stator windings. The speed of the machine has been assumed to be constant to ``linearize'' the system. The admittance function has been used to obtain the waveform of stator line current for a given line voltage waveform using fast Fourier transforms. The waveforms obtained using this method have been compared with the waveforms obtained in experimental investigations reported earlier. The two are in excellent agreement."
"A static power converter operating on the principle of parametric excitation is analyzed. The energy transfer from the input to the output takes place via the magnetic field without mutually coupling the windings. The transfer is accomplished by affecting the reluctance of the secondary winding. Thus output becomes available which is essentially independent of the waveform of the excitation; transients and noise are filtered. The characteristics of the converter are derived in a qualitative manner, and the outstanding characteristics of the device such as voltage regulations, under-and over- voltage protection, load dependence. and inherent protection against overload are explained."
"The published literature deals with Arno converters with identical number of turns in three phases and capacitors connected for reducing negative sequence voltage. This paper presents the analysis of the Arno converter with additional turns in the auxiliary phase. The starting and running performance are analyzed using modified symmetrical component theory. Theoretical results are compared with experimental results for a 120kVA converter developed for ac locomotive duty. Effects of variation of voltages and machine parameters on performance are also discussed."
"The low power factor of phase-controlled converters when the output voltage is less than the maximum is of-concern in high-power equipment. In a converter consisting of two commutating groups in cascade, the usually low power factor can be improved by firing or gating the thyristors in the two groups asymmetrically. One of the groups is fully advanced (or retarded) to minimize its reactive power, while the other group is controlled to give the desired dc Output. The technique is not recommended for single three-phase bridge converters because of third-hannonic output ripple, second-harmonic line current distortion, and danger of commutation failure. These objections are overcome by combining pairs of three-phase bridges. When regeneration is not required, half of the thyristors can be replaced by diodes, reducing the cost. The method should offer substantial improvement in the power factor of cycloconverter ac motor drives as well as dc motor drives."
"Maximum surge current is one of the important ratings of semiconductor rectifiers. There are several methods in the literature for calculating dc bus fault currents. These methods have largely been devoted to rectifier equipment without phase control."
"A study of the behavior of current limiting fuses and of their effectiveness in protecting power thyristors is presented. Mathematical models simulating the prearcing and arcing characteristics of the fuse are described and used for analog computer evaluations. The junction temperature response of a thyristor to surge currents is analyzed with the aid of a further model. Finally, the fuse and thyristor simulations are coupled for a survey of the combined system. From this, a practical fuse/thyristor coordination rule is developed."
"Mass transportation is being recognized as a critical need in modern society. The application requirements of propulsion motors for rail passenger vehicles can be derived from elementary mechanics of motion. The implications in motor design are discussed in this paper."
"The Swedish State Railways' decision to order thyristor -controlled locomotives has given Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA) the privilege of being the first company in the world to build this type of locomotive in a long series. This paper explains the choice of low-frequency ac for electric traction equipment in Sweden and then traces the development of the modern thyristor locomotive. Advantages of this design, and special measures required to deal with reactive power and harmonic currents, are set forth, as are the operating experience and tests which have been conducted on this new type of locomotive."
"In May 1966 the Swedish State Railways (SJ) ordered from Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA) 90 two-car units intended for the suburban services in Stockholm. The order was later increased to a total of 102 two-car sets. In June 1970, 90 sets were delivered. The cars have thyristor control equipment and separately excited dc traction motors. The line voltage is 15 kV, 162/3 Hz."
"Self-regulating ceramic heating systems that operate without conventional thermostatic controls are now being designed into heated appliances. The result is longer life, lower cost, and more streamlined appliance packaging. The development appropriately comes at a time when end of life safety is receiving increased attention, cost reductions in heater-thermostat systems are producing diminishing returns, and the volume of heated portable appliances for personal care and food warming is growing rapidly. The Semiconducting barium titanate heaters undergo a crystalline phase change and resultant resistivity increase in the vicinity of the ferro-electric curie temperature. This characteristic provides high initial power at which point the sharply increasing heater resistance reduces power to the required steady-state level. Positive temperature coefficient (PTC) barium titanate has been used since the 1950's for low voltage sensors, but was only made available for appliance heaters by the recent development of line voltage materials for a different segment of industry-color television. One third of all color sets now use 120-V PTC degaussing elements. The paper discusses the complex thermal design considerations involved in the development of a PTC heater for 10-200 W appliances and reviews the application of a PTC heater to a food warmer."
"Flow and heat transfer conditions are investigated on rotating flat plates and on blades of tangential blowers. The solution of the three dimensional boundary layer equations for rotating flat plates show that 3-D effects are of influence only in the neighborhood of the axis of rotation. The conditions outside this region can be treated as flow in a 2-D system. The measurements indicate that turbulent flow exists already at Re-values much smaller than Reclit for stationary flat plates. As a result of this, high heat transfer rates can be achieved at lower average velocities. All data taken on rotating flat plates and on the blades of a tangential blower can be correlated by a single dimensionless relationship. The results obtained by theory and measurements are used to derive design curves for the construction of a heat pump. A device built in accordance to these curves performed as predicted. Discussed are also rotating furnaces, radiators and condensers for vapor driven engines."
"The control described is based on the combination of three techniques to develop an accurate low-cost unit responsive to frost loading on evaporator coils. For sensing, a fluidic type sensor monitors the air pressure drop across the evaporator, responding to signals in the order of 0.1 to 0.5 in of water. To detect the signal from the sensor, a simple yet highly accurate and reliable transistor bridge circuit is used. A motor driven timer, which integrates the detected signal, provides a uniform period for defrost and run off, and switches the relatively high currents of the defrost and compressor circuits. The use of this system can extend the interdefrost interval in low humidity conditions by a factor of 3 or 4."

 "After a review of standard xerography, it is shown that optical techniques can be used to perform all the xerographic functions (charging, exposure, transfer, fusing and cleaning) except development. ``Photoelectric charging'' and ``induction charging'' are described in detail, and the complicated and subtle phenomena which occur at the photoconductor interfaces are clarified. ``Persistent internal polarization (PIP)'' is also discussed, and the role of the photoconductor interfaces and the bulk traps in the photoconductor are clarified. The spectral considerations necessary to optimize machine performance are discussed in terms of the crucial components (lamps, documents, optics and photoconductors). The new concept of ``optical transfer'' and the use of light to aid in ``cleaning'' are described. The use of radiation to perform xerographic fusing is described for both ``flash'' fusing and ``radiant'' fusing. The essential concepts necessary for achieving ``selective fusing'' are discussed."
"Voltage level variations are shown to be only one of eight different types of voltage deviations which can affect motor characteristics. Each of these is discussed in relation to possible detrimental effects on operating costs or motor reliability. The timeliness of the paper is demonstrated, especially for continuous process and automated industries. Remedial measures, when indicated, are shown to cover a wide gamut from redesigning control systems to reappraising the electrical system one line diagram."
"The protection of a fuel-cell system requires a circuit breaker which will trip more rapidly when overcurrent is accompanied by undervoltage, but it should not trip with undervoltage alone without overcurrent."
"Insulation system integrity is probably the most important factor in satisfactory transformer performance; changes and improvements in transformer insulation systems take place continuously. Insulation systems are described, as they are currently constituted in oil immersed, askarel insulated, dry type, gas insulated, and encapsulated power transformers. Since transformer life is directly related to the insulation system and its time-temperature characteristics, the performance of the complete system, rather than that of individual components, is stressed."
"Vacuum circuit breakers have been used successfully in a variety of applications, spanning duties from fault interruption to highly repetitive arc-furnace switching. Application guidelines that have resulted from extensive engineering investigations and successful experience in service are described."
"The application of lasers to industrial electrothermal processes is discussed together with the factors affecting the choice of laser. The use of gas jet assistance in cutting applications is described, and the influence of gas jet assistance on the cutting rate and cut quality for metals and nonmetals is shown."
"An analysis of the process of tube expansion by electromagnetic forces has been suggested for an approximate evaluation of pressure, velocity, and radius. Reasonable agreement is obtained with experimental results."
"The conventional method which has been used for specifying the load current/time capability of power conversion equipment is based on the provision of continuous and short-time current ratings under specified conditions of service. This method is not suitable for establishing the capability of the equipment for supplying arbitrary load current/time demands on a repetitive duty cycle basis. This paper develops the basis for a method of rating which can be used for this purpose. It is a method that is application rather than equipment oriented. It involves the construction of a service current profile which is actually a function rather than a value. The method has been incorporated in standards which have been proposed for thyristor power conversion equipment for dc motor drives by the appropriate committees within NEMA, IEEE, and the IEC. The concept, in fact, was developed through the deliberations of those committees. It should be remarked that the method can also be applied to other types of power equipment."
"Inherent simplicity and high efficiency combined with an excellent dynamic behavior make the use of self-oscillating switching circuits an attractive alternative in the design of electronic power conditioning equipment. Unfortunately, these free-running circuits often suffer from large variations in operating frequency under varying line and load conditions, a deficiency which seriously limits their usefulness for many applications. A general approach is described by which this drawback can be remedied without impairing the aforementioned advantages."
"Cycloconverter control circuitry is discussed using examples from a practical three-phase to single-phase circulating current free cycloconverter. The voltage biased cosine wave technique is used for phase control. Phase-forward and phase-back limit (PBL) pulses are superimposed on each cosine wave. Spurious gating pulses in the range 180° to 360° are suppressed. A new current zero detector is presented involving continuous monitoring of the voltage across each thyristor. Two types of circulating current elimination logic are used, suitable for 1)resistive and lagging loads, and 2)leading, resistive, and lagging loads. Auxiliary gate pulses are supplied to the incoming converter to prevent large gaps in the load current waveform."
"A fixed-frequency 360-Hz SCR inverter operated with an inductive and three-phase motor load is described. Such an inverter could provide a solid-state motor control more compact and possibly at a lower cost for a given horsepower than a 60-Hz system. A McMurray-Bedford inverter circuit was used similar to that described by Bedford and Hoft in [1]. The inverter operation has been described in detail by an approximate equivalent circuit approach for which a digital computer simulation was devised. Computer plots of various waveforms and experimental results are included. This simulation gives a thorough prediction of the circuit behavior with inductive load. The circuit provides a reliable and efficient ac power source with a fixed frequency. An accurate prediction by the digital computer simulation enables one to choose most efficiently. circuit elements which would perform the function most efficiently."
"The power handling capability of thyristors and silicon rectifiers have, in the last few years, increased to the power handling application range previously served by the ignitron. The ratings of the power semiconductor, however, are significantly different than ignitron ratings. Power semiconductor ratings are compared with ignitron ratings when applied in welding and other applications having cyclic loads. By careful review of how averaging time is defined for power semiconductors, the ratings of thyristors are presented on the well-known ignitron rating format. This permits direct comparison of the power handling capabilities of the power semiconductor to the ignitron."

"The general nature of contouring errors experienced in type 1 servo systems as a result of command contours is described. Both transient and steady-state errors are discussed. A significant result illustrates that contouring error is essentially a result of mismatched gains in the servo drives and the contour. The relative significance of errors associated with a mismatch in time constants, modeling technique employed, and magnitude of velocity gains is discussed."

It suggests a systems approach to electrification, on the basis that proper coordination of propulsion power with signaling and communication facilities can materially improve the return on investment for electrification."

 "This paper describes a variable-frequency source employing the cycloconverter principle. SCR's have been used as the principal switching and voltage-regulating devices. The logic of the firing circuit has been discussed. The factor affecting output frequency stability has also been presented. A three-phase variable low-frequency oscillator has been used as the reference to achieve the variation of frequency. Voltage variation has been affected by phase delaying of the firing pulses in a manner similar to that in a phase-controlled rectifier. Provision has been made for changing the phase sequence at the output in order to facilitate reversal of the direction of rotation of the motor. Experimental results include output waveforms of various frequencies (0-30 Hz), and speed variations of the experimental motor (1 hp, 100 V, 1700 r/min) in either direction of rotation thereby providing the practical feasibility of the SCR cycloconverter for speed control of induction motors."
"A large chemical complex having the total electrical load served by in-plant generation and purchased power from four remotely located purchased-power substations required electrical load information in one location. The megawatt and megavar information is used to control the ``take'' from the utility company to optimize billing costs. Total purchased power and individual substation load information is required to permit control of purchased-power load by manipulation of generation and plant load."
"The most troublesome electrical noise source in industrial control systems, the ``showering arc,'' and the resulting induced noise in adjacent lines is characterized by oscillograms and other measurements. It is shown that shunt capacitance due to wiring can increase the severity of this noise. Transient voltage peaks of 17 000 V have been observed; 2000-V peaks are common in 120-V ac systems. Malfunction of control systems due to these transients can be prevented by proper isolation shielding techniques or elimination of the noise at its source. A method to provide assistance in the selection of a capacitor quench circuit is presented, showing that capacitors of not more than 0.5 µF are adequate."
"Bulk materials required in the preparation of glass have been historically conveyed using contact flow and feeding devices with electromechanical and electrical or electronic devices serving as logic control. It is now economically feasible to solve the control problem with the use of a minicomputer. Material flow efficiency can also be improved with state-of-the-art mechanical devices. Such a solution is described."
"The introduction of glass gaging has come about due to the rigid requirements of close dimension for television picture tubes. Prior to the advent of television tubes to the glass industry, the requirement for sophisticated gaging was nonexistent. Television glass, on the other hand, has several very close requirements. The inside surface of the face panel requires a generally spherical shape to be within 0.015 in of true contour, while the periphery of the skirt or edges of the panel must be held to ±0.040, and flatness of the mating surface called ``seal land'' must be within 0.015 in. Add to all of this the fact that glass scratches easily and chips or breaks readily and so upon the stage enters automatic gaging."

"This paper describes a coupled equivalent circuit approach for predicting the current distribution in three-dimensional geometries having axial symmetry. Specimens of arbitrary cross section can be handled by this numerical method so long as they have circular symmetry about the coil axis. Several self-inductance and mutual inductance formulas are investigated, and the merits of these formulas for calculating the parameters for the equivalent circuit are compared. Experimental and theoretical results are compared for a variety of geometries. Current density probes were used to obtain the experimental results."
"The electrical heating of pipelines has received a lot of attention recently because of better controllability and maintenance experience than steam tracing. This paper describes a way of electrical heating with a variable resistance wire. The installation in a manufacturing area, with many zones of process piping to be heated is described. These methods reduced design and installation costs."
"The invitation to talk about sputtering in a conference devoted to heating may seem incongruous. Sputtering is primarily a mechanical effect, a dislodging of material from a solid target by bombardment with gas ions. To be sure, a lot of heat is developed in the process, but this heat is usually unwanted and must be removed or limited. Wehner [1] estimates that 95 percent of ion energy appears as heat in the target. From the user's point of view, the exact classification of the process does not matter. Sputtering is competitive with many industrial processes that are purely thermal such as coating or bonding by evaporation or by melting. It is this competitive situation that should be of interest to the potential user of the sputtering process. His questions are likely to be: Can sputtering do what conventional heating cannot do? Can sputtering achieve a lower product cost or improved product quality, as compared with a purely thermal process? Is sputtering sufficiently simple and controllable to be used as a production process? These questions cannot be answered in detail by a short paper. Rather, an attempt is made to supply a generalized answer, derived from a rough simplistic description of the physical principle of sputtering. The gist of this answer is that in many specialized applications where purely thermal processes become difficult to control, sputtering can indeed be superior. The accurate control claimed for depositing materials by sputtering comes about mainly because sputtering is an ``atom by atom'' transfer process."
"This paper describes the practical design and operating principles of the pulsewidth modulated (PWM) inverter. The use of this power circuit in a variable voltage, variable frequency ac motor drive is emphasized. A comparison with the conventional adjustable voltage input inverter is made with respect to input-output characteristics as well as the effect of the unit on the input supply. This paper demonstrates the ability to design and produce a practical system using state of the arts components."

"It is generally necessary to connect an RC snubber across a power rectifier or thyristor to absorb the energy associated with the recovery current of the device and limit the resulting voltage spike and rate of rise dv/dt. For a given snubber capacitance, it is shown that there is an optimum damping resistance which minimizes the peak voltage, but a lower resistance is required to minimize the average dv/dt to the peak. Design procedures are derived for selecting the capacitance and optimum resistance to limit the peak voltage or dv/dt to specified values. The device recovery current is trapped in circuit inductance, and its energy must be dissipated, while the snubber produces additional losses as the price of performing its limiting function."
"A method of determining a given heat exchanger's thermal properties from the characteristics of the cooling medium is discussed. A test method is presented with an example which helps to clarify the results.

In addition the special rating of SCR's and cooling requirements for cyclic duty are described along with techniques for protecting the devices from overvoltage, overcurrent, and loss of coolant. Gating requirements are outlined from a circuit view point."
"This paper describes a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) dc-to-dc converter. A switching type circuit is employed which controls the power to a load by connecting the dc source to the load and disconnecting it from the load in a cyclical manner. The on to off time ratio is varied to control the average voltage delivered to the load. Either a constant frequency variable pulsewidth mode, or a constant pulsewidth variable frequency mode of operation is used. This means of controlling a dc voltage is a nearly lossless scheme with high efficiency SCR switches."
"Pulsewidth modulation of a six-step inverter can be accomplished in different ways. Comparisons between different modulation techniques are based primarily on harmonic content in the output waveform and circuit constraints imposed by semiconductor characteristics. Adaptive ratio is a modulation scheme which combines the beneficial features of several available techniques and makes the necessary compromises to optimize the operating characteristics of a modulated six-step inverter."
"An inverter configuration with an auxiliary shutoff circuit designed for traction applications is described. The auxiliary shutoff energy adds to the main shutoff energy providing the necessary shutoff capability at stall and low motor speeds where maximum traction is required. The auxiliary shutoff is automatically programmed so that its effect diminishes gradually as the motor speed increases. Such programming results in a reliable inverter where the volt-ampere rating of thyristors are best utilized to provide active power and safety margin. The inverter can be used in conjunction with a chopper, providing variable dc voltage, to convert a fixed dc voltage source to a variable frequency and amplitude ac source. The inverter can also be used in conjunction with a controlled rectifier, providing variable dc voltage, to convert the 60-Hz fixed frequency and voltage commercial supply to a variable voltage and frequency ac supply."

The use of a dc filter choke and a current feedback loop to produce a regenerative current source is explained. The simplified inverter commutation circuit made possible by the current-source technique is also discussed. Finally, a brief review of the inherently rugged current-source converter's ability to provide wide range control of an ac induction motor is given."
"A transformer-coupled dc-to-dc converter, in which the voltage-regulation feedback loop also serves to establish the self-oscillations required for dc-to-ac inversion, is described in this paper. This results in improved circuit economy as compared to conventional converters in which regulation and inversion are separate functions."
"Torque amplification in a steel mill or impact phenomena in a general elastic system can be analyzed by a similarity transformation of the linear equations of motion using their eigen-vector or modal matrix. Response to initial displacement or velocity and to step function forces are developed in a way that forms the principle of a fast accurate computer program. Torque amplification is the result of ill conditioning of the modal matrix and the disturbance but is mostly related to the modal matrix and is, therefore, mostly a function of the rotor system. Steel mills and other multiple inertia systems such as motor generator sets should be analyzed by this method at an early stage of their design."
"In recent years, there has been increasing emphasis upon the utilization of integrated circuits (IC's) to perform many of the basic control functions in circuitry for power equipment. The advantages of this approach accrue from the economic considerations involved with using IC's in quantities and also the feasibility that a certain amount of standardization of circuitry may be obtained. The subject of this paper is a newly developed IC control module, the level detector, which is intended for use in telephone power systems equipment."
"The growing use of vacuum interruption devices by the power and control industry in the last decade introduces these devices to many people for whom the area of vacuum interruption is somewhat new. It is felt that a review of the subject of vacuum interruption from a scientific and technological viewpoint, is needed.

This paper will also provide the most complete chronological bibliography available today on this subject."
"A never ending stream of magazine articles, IEEE papers, National Electrical Code proposals and revisions attest to the need for better protection of motors, controllers, and branch circuits. Superior branch circuit overcurrent protection can be obtained by a combination of specially designed motor short-circuit protectors and especially approved motor controllers. This paper explains the protection provided and mentions test results for a range of fault currents up to a very high level."
"Load flows, more recently called power flows, have been a tool of the systems analyst for many years. Mostly load flow studies in the past have been made by large utilities to determine the system behavior under certain specified conditions. In the recent past some industrial plants have electrical systems as large and complex as some of the utility systems of yesteryear. This paper is an effort to set forth the benefits that the industrial plant operator may obtain from a load flow study of his electrical system."
"The availability of large quantities of electrical power and sophisticated means of control has justified the use of induction methods in heating large steel slabs to rolling mill temperatures. Capable of delivering 210 MW, a unique power system, comprising power transformers, autotransformers, static switches, and capacitor banks, provides eighteen induction heaters with controlled electrical energy. The entire system can deliver 600 ton/h of steel to the rolling mill. The basic overall automatic control scheme involves the operations of slab handling control, heater control, static power switching, and computer control. The control functions, including phase balance and demand limit control, are described and discussed. The features and operation of the static power switch, capable of switching close to 10 000 A, are presented. Used as a protective device, the switch can clear up to 210 000-A faults in less than one cycle."
"The paper presents a new apparatus for electrostatic beneficiation of fluidized ores. The apparatus comprises a fluidized bed, an optional metallic screen electrode located above the bed, and a series of collecting U-or V-shaped troughs. The troughs are moving horizontally below the screen. The vertical electric field traversing the fluid bed was produced by applying high voltage to a porous metallic plate on the floor of the bed and grounding the troughs and screen."

"Modern high speed process lines demand good tension control for best performance. This paper deals specifically with the application of load cell type tensiometers on Stelco's no. 3 galvanizing line, however, the merits of this type of tension control apply as well to other process lines. It describes and shows the advantage of tension regulation by the use of tensiometers versus current regulation."
"An understanding of torque relationships in the operation of rotary grinding mills necessitates a complete analysis of the mill, gear train, and drive motor insofar as torsional load, inertia, and frictional losses are concerned. Ability of a drive motor to develop the required torque is dependent upon its inherent torque characteristics in combination with its electrical supply system. A complete evaluation of both the drive motor and power system is therefore necessary to assure that proper torque will be supplied by the drive motor for the mill requirements."
"Water pollution regulations and the types and sources of water pollution common to a ``typical'' cement plant are discussed. With the exception of the problem of totally dissolved solids in ``process'' water, solutions to most of the other water pollution problems common to a cement plant have been known.

"This paper introduces a computerized wiring system that is new to the industry. It begins with the reasons for the development of the computer program to process the wiring system data in favor of conventional drafted schedules and diagrams. A brief explanation of the computer program is given, and the common terms associated with wiring methods are redefined for use by the computer. The program operates by itemizing the input data of raceways, circuits, and wire terminations; processing these data to create maintenance files and print various schedules. Sample schedules included in the paper show how some of the schedules are intended for use by the designers, some for contract documentation, and others for construction or maintenance. Methods for updating, revising, and maintaining the computer file are also included, and a general guide for planning and controlling a project via computer wiring system methods is offered. Finally the merits of the computerized system are discussed with possible future improvements projected."
"The proper shielding of control cables in an industrial control system is an important part of the system's design. With the advent of direct digital and analog process control in large industrial facilities such as steel mills and power plants, the minimumization of interference induced in the communication link between the in-plant transducers and analog or digital controller becomes an important problem. The communication link may be very short, or run for several miles, depending upon the installation. In most cases, this link is a pair of electrical conductors. It is often necessary to shield these control and instrumentation cables. This paper describes a series of tests that were developed to determine the shielding efficiency of cable trays made of various types of material. Tests are described for both electromagnetic and electrostatic fields. As in most engineering decisions, the final choice of material must be the result of a compromise."
"A hybrid integrated circuit is described which generates two phase-shifted 20-kHz output pulse trains whose duty cycles are related to the amplitude of an applied input signal. The circuit was designed primarily for use in power conditioning schemes utilizing pulsewidth modulated signals for regulated dc-to-dc voltage conversion. Realization of this hybrid circuit has been accomplished with a beam-lead sealed-junction monolithic silicon chip and several tantalum thin-film resistors and capacitors which are bonded/ deposited on a ceramic substrate in the form of a 28-terminal dual-in line package (DIP)."
"Selective-collective elevators present, as far as the logic design is concerned, the most complex control problems among simplex elevators. A control unit for this type of elevator, completely based on the use of digital integrated circuits, is described in the paper. The application of integrated circuits improves, in the authors' opinion, reliability and maintainability of elevator control as compared with the classical control units equipped with electromechanical relays and even more recent static solutions with discrete transistor logic circuits. This approach gives not only technical advantages, but is also justified from the economic point of view. The developed elevator control has been constructed and tested successfully on a six-floor office building. Owing to the conception of the functional subunits, it is possible to build up controls for any number of floors using only five standard printed circuit boards. The design of the control unit is based on the combinational and asynchronous sequential logic circuits. The Boolean equations, according to which the subunits were implemented, are given in the paper."
"The current fuel market situation is causing more cement plants to look toward fuel oil as either a primary or as a secondary fuel.

"Improved position detection using a one-dimensional photosensor array has been shown [1], [2] to be possible by applying a high-frequency triangular perturbation signal to a normalized target image. This paper develops an adequate model for describing the receptor system with respect to the perturbation amplitude, the receptor element threshold, and the deadband between elements. From the model, it is shown how the parameters can be adjusted to achieve a linear position transfer characteristic when deadband exists between elements."
"The design of a three-phase square wave generator with continuously variable output frequency in the 40-400 Hz range is described. The basic generator circuit consists of an astable multivibrator, and a divide-by-three logic network followed by a divide-by-two logic network with a synchronizing gate. Frequency control is arranged in the multivibrator. The synchronizing gate assures fixed output signal phase sequence. Noninverted and inverted output is available. In order to provide adequate output power, push-pull load driving stages preceded by emitter followers are incorporated. Transformer coupled output is used in the prototype to drive SCRs in a high-power three-phase static frequency changer. Custom wound toroidal core transformers have been used. The rise time of the square wave at the generator output is below 3μs."
"Push-pull magnetic amplifiers using a single core are known for circumventing the problem of core matching, but these amplifiers have the following drawbacks: the extreme reduction of gain with the decrease of input resistance, low output power, etc. These problems can be solved by using two magnetic circuits of a stacked four-legged core structure as twin cores in the full-wave type of self-saturating magnetic amplifier. Experiments show that it is possible to obtain twin cores sufficiently well matched, because each leg is from the same sheet, and to decrease the thermal resistance between the twin cores by the yoke connecting between them. As a result it is evident that the use of a four-legged core can improve the zero drift caused mainly by the change of ambient temperature. With this four-legged core structure, the input magnetomotive force equivalent to the zero drift caused by the change of ambient temperature can be decreased by at least one order of magnitude, as compared with spiral core pairs."
"The switching-on current surge of the high-power electronic tube filaments may be restricted by gradually applying the filament voltage, series connecting resistors or an inductor in the filament circuit, and by using a leaky-flux filament transformer."
"A technique for synchronizing oscillators based on the coincidence of output pulses has been developed for synchronizing an ultrareliable parallel static-inverter system. A prototype system in which the output frequency is determined statistically by considering the coincidence of the [(n/2)+1]th pulse from the system's n oscillators was constructed. Particular care was taken to ensure that the system was not dependent on any single component or subsystem and that failure of any oscillator channel would not substantially affect remaining oscillators. Testing of the prototype system, which included a 120 h continuous run, showed that design objectives have been achieved, and it was concluded that this system offers a practicable solution to the problem of synchronizing parallel-path static-inverter systems."

By analogy a comparison is made to show how these same methods can be used in the development of transducers, instrumentation, and complex systems for use in medicine."
"Recent improvements in the design of humidity-sensing transducers and the materials used in their construction have minimized many of the past limitations of humidity sensors. In this paper a new resistance humidity sensor is described which is an improvement over other resistance-type elements from the standpoint of contamination resistance, stability, and durability. The humidity-sensing element is a multilayered humidity-sensitive polymeric film, consisting of an electrically conductive core and insulating outer layers which are partially hydrolyzed. The element has a nominal resistance of 2500 Ω and a humidity sensitivity of approximately 2 Ω/ percent relative humidity (RH) at 50 percent RH. The characteristics of the humidity sensor are discussed and include the element's sensitivity to relative humidity, response characteristics, and long-term stability characteristics. The effects of temperature, air velocity, applied voltage, and type of excitation on element performance are also discussed."

"A shoulder position transducer has been designed and built for use by quadriplegic patients as a control signal source. It provides control signals suitable for controlling two-axis assistive devices utilizing proportional control. The signals correspond to shoulder elevation/depression and protraction/retraction. The device is small [measuring 2 in (5 cm) by 2 in (5 cm) by 5/8 in (1.6 cm) thick] and is held over the sternum by a lightweight harness or double-sided tape. A spring wire extends from the package to the shoulder where it is attached. Flexures of the wire in the vertical and horizontal directions are detected by semiconductor strain elements. Signal amplitudes of 1 to 2 V are obtained for shoulder movements of 1 in. Channel crosstalk is less than 5 percent (dependent on the accuracy of strain element mounting). To accommodate individual characteristics and postural changes, the device utilizes an automatic rezeroing circuit. This circuit enables any point in the coordinate system to be defined as the resting position and the center of control upon command by the operator."

"An attempt has been made to show how well a dc permanent-magnet motor fits the requirements of the minimum-time position control problem. Using a second-order mathematical model, phase plane trajectories are studied, and an approximate solution for the switching time has been obtained in an explicit form. It has been shown that the on-line estimation of three auxiliary parameters will permit the determination of the switching time even for the very difficult problem of load variations."
"The practical implementation of minimum-time control of angular position using a permanent-magnet dc servomotor is considered. First an analog time-optimal controller derived from the switching characteristics is discussed. This leads to the digital controller based on the quantization of these characteristics. The use of a suitable digital tachometer makes it possible to reach the theoretical minimum time."

It is replaced by two equations of known variables consisting of the system parameters, the optimizing period, and the weighting factors of the cost function."
"A new method of measuring the area of object images utilizing a two-dimensional chemical array is presented.

"Commutating capacitor voltage and current equations are derived for the commutation period of the main and auxiliary SCRs. The circuit turn-off time is computed as a function of x, where x is the ratio of the maximum load current to be commutated to the peak discharge current of the commutating capacitor. A suitable choice of x is suggested. In addition to the worst case design for L1, L2, and C, a nomograph for the selection of L1, L2, and C is given as a function of x."
"Simplified design equations are presented based on a general and exact analysis of self-oscillating dc-to-dc converters. Converters with and without transformer coupling can be designed using these simplified equations. A discussion is presented which shows the relationship between circuit parameters and such performance characteristics as switching frequency, duty cycle, regulation, and peak-to-peak ripple bounds. The general performance and inherent limitations are then predicted for various circuit configurations. It is shown that most of the disadvantages usually ascribed to this class of circuit can be eliminated by proper circuit design.

"An algorithm that can be used to calculate the true temperature profile from a series of temperature measurements made with a thermocouple having shunting errors due to insulator leakage is described. Inputs to the program are a series of voltages measured at the cold end of the thermocouple as it is inserted into the temperature gradient and the physical and material characteristic of the thermocouple."
"The voltage-to-frequency converter presented here is an approach to the problem of realizing the modulation unit of the data-acquisition system in a computer-controlled industrial process."
"In a paper by McVey and Chen [1] the effect of the amplitude of a sinusoidal perturbtion signal on the accuracy of a position detection system was presented. However, the amplitudes considered were chosen arbitrarily, and no optimum value was specified. This paper presents a method for determining an optimum amplitude for a sinusoidal or, for that matter, any other perturbation signal. In addition, the method may be used to eliminate certain functional forms of a perturbation signal from consideration for a given receptor geometry."
"The feasibility of applying microwave techniques for nondestructive testing of concrete strength during the curing process is investigated in terms of the dielectric permittivity variations during the process. The experimental data show that the interrelation between permittivity and strength of concrete can be established."

 "Methods of evaluation of M.O.S. memories with the S.E.M. in voltage contrast mode with emphasis on surface potential measurement techniques were discussed. An HF 1101 - 256 bit RAM was used as the test vehicle and techniques for threshold voltage measurements on any M.O.S. transistor in the circuit was established. Voltage contrast images of patterns written into the memory and a stroboscopic method of analysing the device under dynamic conditions were reported."
"Under some power transistor operating conditions, current crowding leads to a region of localized power dissipation. Such hot spot operation should be avoided because it produces excessive localized junction temperatures that degrade electrical performance of devices and cause thermal fatigue. Its presence may indicate an abnormally high susceptibility to second breakdown. A non-destructive screening technique has been developed to cull out power transistors with hot spots due to current crowding. The technique is based on the use of d-c current gain, hFE, measured as a function of collector voltage with the collector current, IC, held constant. In this procedure, the base current of the transistor under test is measured as a function of collector voltage while the collector current and case temperature are held constant. Under these conditions, base current is proportional to the reciprocal of hFE. Hot spot formation is indicated by an increase in the base current, which normally decreases with increasing collector voltage. Hot spots were often found to occur within the published maximum ratings of the transistors, under operating conditions well below those leading to second breakdown. Typical examples are presented of base current (proportional to l/hFE) as a function of collectoremitter voltage for a variety of operating conditions under which hot spot formation occurs. Data are presented comparing the use of thermal resistance, emitter-base voltage, and hFE to indicate the formation of hot spots."
"Three basic methods of detecting intermittent shorts in components have been discussed. Each one has limitations, but if properly used, alone or in combination with one of the others, can greatly reduce problems due to shorts caused by particles. Additional work in this area is required to provide a completely reliable method of exciting very small particles and to improve effectivities, particularly on aluminum and silicon particles."
 "This paper describes a method for detecting the presence of small conducting particles capable of inducing circuit malfunction in electronic devices. The method differs from previous practice in several important ways. 1. Detection circuitry is mounted on the vibrating shaker table eliminating cable wear problems and greatly decreasing minimum detection time for shorts, such that all possible short circuit events can be detected. 2. Vibrational force input is specifically designed to maximize probability of detection in a given time. 3. An optoelectronic read-out for circuit latch-up is provided. The circuit can be manually reset during operation to permit confirmation of existence of a particle as required."
"A plug in module has been developed for the measurement of surface voltages of semiconductor devices in a standard S.E.M. The secondary electrons produced by the S.E.M. electron beam are removed by a normal field and collected in a modified Everhart-Thornley detector. The design of the apparatus allows complete top access to the device. The detector output vs. surface voltage is essentially linear over a -10 to +10 volt range."
"Microwave mixer diodes designed for X-band frequencies and above have a small active region and therefore are limited in power handling capability. Many applications for these types of diodes are in high power radar systems. The sensitive mixer diodes are protected from any high power reflected signals by gaseous or solid state limiters. These limiters allow low level incoming signals to reach the mixer diodes but reflect unwanted high powers. However, RE pulses of 1 to 50 watts peak with pulse width varying 1 - 10 ns are often incident on the mixer diode due to \"turn on\" behavior of the gaseous limiter TR tube. Both this pulse height and pulse width are important in diode failure (although not directly interchangeable). The reliability feature of the mixer diodes which we will discuss will involve the diodes' capability to withstand RF spikes of energy typically in the pulse width range of 3 to 10 nanoseconds."
 "This late news paper is a report on the design and the evaluation of a new passivation technique for plastic encapsulated transistors. A family of small signal solid encapsulated transistors has been designed and fabricated and tests have shown that they are able to perform to military specifications. The structure of these devices includes a clean silicon dioxide passivation layer sealed with a barrier of silicon nitride, a gold coated refractory metalization system and a high temperature glass coating."
"An investigation of the effects of package. structures upon IC failure rates led to the development of a new molded DIP (dual in-line package) with exceptional reliability. The design, which is being put into production, rivals hermetic packages in mechanical and environmental reliability. The study began as an effort to reduce the initial thermal intermittent and temperature cycle reject rates encountered during production testing of industrial IC's packaged in silicone DIPs. The DIP used has a rigid body, but before molding of the body the die is coated with an elastomer to provide added moisture resistance and mechanical buffering. While generally more reliable than earlier DIP designs, this structure still allowed stressing of the wire bonds during temperature cycling and was not as resistant to salt atmosphere as epoxy packages. Also, the need for a die coat had become questionable since current practice is to \"glass\" the chips during wafer processing. Study of the problem, with optimized bonds, led to the theory that a solid, highly compressive body could be more reliable. Silicone and epoxy models with and without die coats where tested. Data were gathered on the effects of mold shrinkage upon thermal intermittent failure rates and upon ball bond and stitch bond failures during temperature cycling. Also, the effect of glass transition temperature upon failure rate was studied (at Tg, rate of change in thermal expansion coefficient of a plastic icreases markedly)."
"We think we have demonstrated that it is both desirable and practical for an IC manufacturer to adopt controls that assure very high reliability devices for the consumer and industrial equipment. Molded packages can be made highly reliable, and with the proper production screens and QC backup, almost al l potential failures can be elimated before ship nent to the customer. We think this makes a great deal more sense than taking 20 samples from a lot and then saying, if they all pass, that the devices are reliable. Statistically, the results from such small samples are not very meaningful. But 100% stressing and testing in production is an excellent safeguard when the package is initially designed for use in adverse environments."
"This paper describes results of tests performed under field conditions and compares these results with data obtained from accelerated laboratory testing. A model is developed for plastic encapsulated semiconductors relating failure rate and the sum of temperature and relative humidity. With this relationship, accelerated temperature-humidity tests can be applied to predict field failure rates of plastic encapsulated transistors and integrated circuits."
"Frequent changes in materials and construction of the integrated circuit plastic packages have forced the consumer to continuous evaluation of their packages. Resistance to moisture is shown on recent plastic and ceramic dual-in-line integrated circuit packages from seven leading manufacturers. Results indicate that package material, barriers over the chip, passivation and backfill, added protection to the chip surface. Under equivalent high moisture environmental conditions, the plastic package does not perform as well as the ceramic. Analysis of test data shows that plastic packages with no added moisture protection may be satisfactory in normal environmental applications. Package resistance to moisture at normal environmental conditions may be determined using overstressed tests and a modified Arrhenius plot."
"The introduction of plastic encapsulated integrated circuits was one of the most significant changes in the semiconductor industry since the development of the integrated circuit itself. While the plastic encapsulation made available low cost-high volume integrated circuits for the industrial and consumer markets, it also introduced a wide range of potential reliability problems. Some of these reliability limitations were recognized and solved early in the development of plastic I/C's while others were of a more subtle nature and took longer to detect and correct. This paper considers the failure modes of plastic encapsulated integrated circuits; the stress tests utilized to detect their presence; the design and process improvements made to eliminate them and presents the results of extensive reliability tests conducted to assess their current reliability status."
"Reliability requirements for commercial, real-time computer systems are comparable today to many of the present-day military electronic systems. To satisfy today's customer, it no longer is sufficient to build commercial computers to so-called \"good-commercial-practices\". Especially in real-time computer systems, the reliability design, testing programs and parts requirements need to be as stringent as present military programs. Because of the increase in commercial reliability requirements, ceramic versus plastic packages for integrated circuits (I.C.s) will be discussed. The writer feels that the ceramic package is three times superior to the present plastic package. The ceramic package should be used wherever the reliability requirements necessitate its use and life cycle costs make it economical to the business."

"Although the bias induced instability which has been discussed is confined to one specific device fabricated on (100) oriented silicon, the general problem of bias induced instability is more prevalent with linear integrated circuits than with the more numerous digital devices. The requirement of higher operating voltages on these linear devices dictates the use of higher resistivity material which is more susceptible to adverse surface effects resulting from any net charge in the overlying passivation layers. Also, the higher internal fields in these devices make it more likely that charge can be moved and concentrated to the extent that it could cause some shift in individual component characteristics. This drift would be most serious in these high gain linear integrated circuits with all components normally biasei in their active region. Digital integrated circuits, besides being less likely to experience drift of individual component characteristics in the first place, probably would not show any such drift in the static terminal parameters commonly measured due to the saturating mode of operation used in the majority of the existing types of logic. To improve the reliability of linear integrated circuits, it is extremely important that the lower passivation layer be of the highest possible quality to minimize the tendency of the high fields to accumulate electronic charge over the underlying silicon."
 "The MNOS memory transistor has been observed to exhibit a negative shift of the threshold states and a loss of memory retention time after a large number of alternating polarity writing pulses. Oxide breakdown and the resulting creation of fast oxide surface states are correlated with the degradation of the memory performance of the device."
 "Two components are observed in the degradation of GaP LED's. We show that the rapid initial component is related to device configuration. This can be minimized by suitable choice of device geometry, significantly improving useful LED life. Consequently, the anomalous (n > 2) current component after degradation is eliminated, allowing a quantitative understanding of degradation."
"The failure of wire bonds due to repeated flexure when semiconductor devices are operated in an on-off mode has been investigated. An accelerated fatigue testing apparatus was constructed and the major fatigue variables, aluminum alloy composition and bonding mechanism, were tested. The data showed Al-1% Mg wires to exhibit superior fatigue characteristics compared to Al-1% Cu or Al-1% Si and ultrasonic bonding to be better than thermo-compression bonding for fatigue resistance. Based on these results highly reliable devices were fabricated using Al-l% Mg wire with u1-trasonic bonding which withstood 1.2 × 105 power cycles with no failures."
"The effect of temperature and relative humidity on the corrosion rate of molybdenum thin films are discussed. The subject of acceleration factors and critical relative humidity for devices using this film is also addressed. A model is presented to explain the observed results."
"The failure of aluminum-to-gold ultrasonic bonds, after storage at elevated temperature, is often accompanied by the presence of \"purple plague\". However, this purple intermetallic phase can also be present in bonds that remain strong after the same treatment. Bond failure has been connected with the presence of impurities in the gold and a failure mechanism is proposed."
"A statistical model has been developed that relates the electromigration-induced failure rates of metallized conductors to the physical processes that cause such failures. The analytical formulation of this model suggests: i) a resolution of the controversy regarding the relationship between mean times-to-failure and the current density, ii) a potentially more useful statistical analysis for failure rates, and, iii) the possibility that electro-migration failure rates and their statistics may be computed after making only a few simple measurements to characterize the system."
"Electromigration failure times in thin film aluminum conducting stripes, such as those used in planar semiconductor devices and integrated circuits, have in the past been shown to increase with certain binary alloy additions. While the addition of copper has been the object of many studies, other additives increase the failure time as much as or even more than copper. These additions, however, also increase the electrical resistivity of the stripes, which is often undesirable. Magnesium additions, for example, may give a failure time which is ten times that of comparable stripes with copper additions but the increase in resistivity is about 100%. Investigations were carried out with ternary and quaternary alloy additions. The additive elements selected were individually known to be effective against electromigration failures. Typical examples of such ternary and quaternary alloys would be Al-Cu-Mg and Al-Cu-Ni-Mg. It has been found possible to obtain large improvements in failure times combined with relatively low resistivity increments through the use of ternary and quaternary alloy additions."
"Electromigration is a momentum transfer process which can cause electrical opens in conductors. The seriousness of this problem increases as the conductor line width and thickness decreases leading to increases in current densities. There has been much data reported on aluminum conductors, but very little work has been reported on gold metal-lizations. The object of this work was to determine the lifetimes of gold conductors defined into realistic geometries. Two different test patterns were used: One was the collector to ground conductor in an experimental oscillator having line widths ranging from 2 to 5 mils. The second pattern used was a straight line pattern 125 mils long and 2 mils wide. These conductors were tested using glass, glazed ceramic and partially glazed ceramic substrates."
"Radiation hardened integrated circuits of the Quad NAND Gate type were evaluated using both standard high temperature stress tests and specially designed low temperature tests. As a result of this program, effective methods were devised for accelerating the major failure mechanism, i.e., electrochemical attack of thin film nichrome resistors. The basic chemical and structural factors contributing to this mechanism were investigated using electron beam microanalysis techniques. Based upon the results of these studies, methods are proposed for minimizing the effects of this failure mechanism for this class of circuits."
"Failure characteristics of thin film capacitors are described in terms of lognormal statistics and acceleration factors are calculated from step stress and static stress testing over a limited range of stress levels. When extrapolations are made to use stress conditions, estimates of the failure probability are obtained. The range of stress conditions producing failures in a reasonable time interval is not adequate to determine whether linear or log-voltage-stress is appropriate for extrapolation. One case yields pessimistically high failure rates and might be rationalized by an extension of the commonly accepted anodization mechanism. This model assumes linear-voltage-stress to failure is linear with log-time to failure."
 "This paper presents the results of an environmental and contact physics study evaluating edgecard connectors from nine manufacturers. Interfacial contact resistance (constriction resistance) was used to monitor contact degradation and can reproducibly provide distributions in resistance characteristic of manufacturer. These techniques have shown that for connectors used in commercial applications, ingress of corrosive reactants through porous gold plate dominates normal force fluctuations in causing contact failure. This is due principally to variations in plating thickness and is a result of poor quality control."
"Failures were experienced when organic adhesives were used to mount components in hybrid devices. These failures were determined to be caused by electrochemical reactions between constituents of the epoxy materials and substrate metallization. The failure mechanisms involved and the precautions necessary for their prevention are discussed in this paper."
"The complex hybrids being developed today probably will be a critical reliability problem if a better method of screening semiconductors prior to assembly into the hybrid is not developed. This paper outlines an approach that is presently under development which appears to hold a great deal of promise. It allows for an all gold interconnect system, improves the yield by using burned in chips, and makes the semiconductor and interconnect system less dependent on good, hermetic packages. It appears that burning in and screening at wafer level is a cost effective method of improving the reliability of complex hybrids."

   "A condensed history of urban modeling is presented to alert the reader to the vast literature that exists on the subject and to place Forrester's Urban Dynamics model in perspective. The influence of the export and service concept is found to be pervasive. With the changing context for urban analysis, the major issues appear to have shifted from that of how to accommodate growth through land allocation process. Among the higher priority issues are concerns with equity and environmental quality, the increasing complexity in client-sponsor relations, the need for better policies for operations as well as investments, and the design of meaningful information systems. To complement the other papers in this special issue, suggestions are made to modify or augment urban dynamics by the use of subjective probabilities; the use of empirical feedback to reduce uncertainties and imperfection of knowledge in urban system behavior; the inclusion of explicit values in the construction of a diversity of urban models used together in a gaming process; and the consideration of projecting structural changes in the urban model as a function of changes in values, institutions, and technology."
"Dynamic computer simulation of urban subsystems provides a number of important advantages for the regional analyst. However, there are a number of difficulties associated with using conventional engineering analysis in systems with a major social component. A number of these difficulties are discussed here. One of the more important of these is the problem of social value structures and implicit goals of society and the modeler."
"A group of new experiments which we have performed using Forrester's model are presented: a study of rent control, effects of changing key parameters, and a study of changing labor requirements which explores the implications of exogenous variables for the model. A second section presents specific criticisms of Forrester's model, an economic evaluation of the model, and ends with some general remarks concerning validation and extension of large models. In order to make this paper accessible to a wide audience, the paper begins with a tutorial description of Forrester's work."
"Forrester's Urban Dynamics model is examined in terms of 1) his assumptions about complex dynamic systems, 2) the a priori bias revealed using a \"normalized\" model, 3) equilibrium changes when the model is modified to fit urban data, and 4) policy predictions of such a modified model."
"A review of Urban Dynamics [1] and additional simulation by the authors is presented. Structural choices of boundary conditions, major subsectors, and multiplier relationships in the Forrester model are examined. Some of their implications and shortcomings are noted. Forrester's policy conclusions and implicit evaluation criteria are discussed and related to our alternative assumptions and simulation."
"Forrester's Urban Dynamics [1] offers an implicit but correct mathematical representation of an urban area's interactions with its environment. That representation can model all unidirectional effects of the area's environment, including suburbs. The model is extended to experiment with the effects of commuting."
"This paper is intended to be a case study in the use of simulation models to test public policy alternatives. Suggested programs for dealing with urban poverty are tested with the aid of different models which describe the linked growth of housing, population, and industry in an urbanized area. The tested programs are: 1) training, to provide the unskilled with job skills; 2) job provision, to make extra jobs for skilled workers; 3) clearance, to eliminate \" excess\" housing and thereby free land which may be used by industry. The models used are: the original Forrester [1] model, which treats a single city as a unit in an unchanging national environment; an extension of this model to include all the central cities of the nation and describe the migration between these areas; and finally a complete revision of the Forrester model to obtain a simulation of the national economy including both cities and suburbs. The three different models give very different results. The original model, which focuses upon applying programs to a single city, strongly indicates that clearance is the only one of these programs which is effective in eliminating urban poverty. The second model indicates that when applied throughout the nation, both the clearance and training programs are effective, but job provision is ineffective. However, the third model uses its more complete picture of the national economy to conclude that job provision can indeed be effective in reducing poverty."
"With some modifications Forrester's characterization of an urban system can be used in several ways in a curriculum such as that in the School of Urban and Public Affairs at Carnegie-Mellon University. The model can be expanded to comprehend several neighborhoods, and then used either in the way a laboratory experience is used as an adjunct to a physical science course, or as a basis for a do-it-yourself simulation. In addition, the model can be made open-ended and become the nucleus of an urban game. This paper outlines a proposal for using Urban Dynamics [1] in each of these modes and details some of the modifications needed to implement these applications."
"The work of the Urban Dynamics researchers, if accurate, has major implications for public policy in the urban sphere. In fact, reversal of many of our present urban policies will be mandated. Since other research, some of which is simulation-based, has begun to suggest similar conclusions, it seems appropriate to consider the potential impact of Urban Dynamics and similar work on urban public sector policymaking. This paper is not a technical analysis of Urban Dynamics; rather, it is a preliminary assessment of possible policy implications of urban simulation research such as the Forrester model."
"The expertise of systems and control engineering is potentially relevant to the problems of contemporary urban society. But to realize this potential, a paradigm which represents urban problems as problems of design and control must be developed. A possible structure for such a paradigm is suggested by Simon's conception of an \" artificial science\" which emphasizes the problem of designing inner environments whose object is to attain goals and to function adaptively in outer environments [11]. This paper proposes an organization-environment model, combining the Urban Dynamics and hierarchical multilevel systems approaches as one possible basis for such a science. A descriptive formal model of an urban government using the multiechelon approach is developed, and the consistency postulate for the system is defined. This definition illustrates a commonly encountered problem in political systems, namely, the imperfect relationship between electoral and administrative processes and \"the general welfare.\" But this problem cannot be examined systematically until an operational overall system goal for a specific system is defined. Modifications of the Forrester Urban Dynamics model to include a coefficient of \"satisfaction\" are described to illustrate a potentially useful definition of such a goal. Preliminary results indicate that the values of this coefficient are consistent with the implicit normative assumptions of the Forrester model."
"The generalized Urban Dynamics model of Forrester was applied to Harris County, Tex. The 40 variables changed were those considered to be \"region dependent.\" The model was initialized with data froni the year 1950. Statistical data for 1960 and 1970 were used to check the validity of the model. The statistical data used were obtained from the 1950, 1960, and 1970 censuses and from various county and city agencies. The results revealed that the model could be used as a planning tool for a specific region, as the final model appeared closely tuned to the county's major statistical variables. The lack of variables in the model which could be directly correlated with statistical data was thought to be the reason for deviations in the subvariables. Sensitivity of the model to a large number of variables was determined."
"In the first part of this paper the policy discussions of the Forrester model [1] are compared with those of the urban planners. Contrary to Forrester's assertions, these are found to be very similar. In the second part of the paper the determinants of population movement are reexamined and found to differ substantially (particularly with respect to policy variables) from both the Forrester model and the implicit model of the urban planners."
"The economist views the Urban Dynamics model as an economic system in which inputs pass through a black box toward the goal of deriving certain outputs. Forrester apparently opts for a city that is attractive to the middle classes, a goal which is accomplished by eliminating employment and housing opportunities for the lower classes, forcing their immigration to and burden on other unprepared cities. The author presents an improved procedure for the quantitative selection of output statements for the simulation. Suggestions are then made for application to the Forrester model, followed by an example of a specific modeling refinement."
"The formal aspects of Forrester's general procedure and some of the substantive assumptions incorporated in his model are discussed. The evaluation is based on the methodological dictum that the status of a model's predictions should be assessed in terms of the assumptions that determine these outcomes. In order to identify the control structure of Forrester's model, the implications of variations in the following parameters or structural assumptions are studied: the basic transition rates in the sectors industry and housing; the multipliers that relate to the competition for scarce land; an alternative conception of industrial regeneration; the conditions governing pressures and flows in the population sector that induce an overall \"converter\" cycle; and the underemployed/labor job ratio and its concomitants. The latter two sets of conditions are reviewed in terms of their relationship to the general development of industry. The situation of the underemployed is analyzed and their existence set in relation to general features of the present stage of industrialization. The particular closed-system conceptualization that underlies the model is discussed, and an assessment of its adequacy to the problem is presented."
"Although the process of applying systems analysis techniques to social systems is receiving considerable and growing attention, a significant barrier to the effectiveness of such efforts has been the lack of concrete data with which to define and validate models. This barrier has been greatly reduced by the advent of system dynamics."
"A computer simulation model (written in GPSS) was developed to analyze passenger and baggage flow through the International Arrivals Building (IAB) at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Capacities and staffing at various federal inspection, baggage claim, and sky cap areas can be initialized before each simulation. Given any input schedule of flights, the program utilizes stored information on processing rates and walking times to provide queue statistics, waiting times, and facility utilizations throughout the IAB as well as statistics for preselected individual flights. Results are being used to develop and evaluate physical and operational plans, especially as affected by the introduction of the new generation of larger aircraft."
"A simulation model is presented which investigates the requirements of patient care in planning new hospitals on the basis of statistical data of health care needs in a community and different administrative policies for providing services. The minimum requirements for future service demands for planning patient care in a hospital on the basis of health statistics in a community are generated by synthetic random observations according to certain probability distributions. The model permits the investigation of the influence of admission control on the manifest service demands as well as the effects of the latter on the utilization of patient care facilities over a period of time. The consequences of possible alternatives for meeting the demands may be determined through experimentation with various time-dependent demand patterns and various policy decisions in planning and management."
"The coincidence of interest in urban problem solving and developments in cybernetics and general systems research and technology is fortunate. However, transfer of knowledge from one field to another is not simple. Urban systems are composed of some elements which require further specifications, and estimation is difficult. Knowledge of parameters and structural relations for urban systems must be transferred to those previously trained in more general systems analysis. The task can be eased by further research in general systems and by developing a team approach to the analysis of urban systems. This paper articulates some of the more general characteristics of urban systems."
"A decision theoretic approach to the problem of verifying that a given observation \"belongs\" to a claimed pattern is examined. The problem presupposes a nonzero probability of impersonations, and verifier actions are ternary in general: a claimed identity is either 1) accepted or 2) rejected, or it is 3) \"blanked\" when the verifier refuses to take either of the actions 1) and 2). Corresponding costs-of-wrong decision will be typically different in applications like speaker verification. We characterize sample observations by normal distributions and provide explicit results for the analytically simple situation of \"efficient\" measurements whose interpattern variances are much greater than their intrapattern variances. In our specific model this will imply that the pdf of a measurement under the \"impersonator\" hypothesis is \"diffuse\" in relation to the pdf of the same measurement under any of several \"true-pattern\" hypotheses. We demonstrate that the likelihood ratio function, in a typical verification task, possesses a finite upper bound and that this is related to a certain threshold effect for verifier decisions. We further mention the suitability of a minimax strategy for verification and compare its performance with those of optimal (minimum-cost) and maximum-likelihood procedures for the binary decision (accept-or-reject) problem. We provide numerical examples that illustrate the minimax performance as a function of 1) a parameter which reflects the peculiarity of the claimed pattern, and of 2) the measurement dimensionality."
"An economical technique for approximating a joint N-dimensional probability density function has been described by Sebestyen and Edie [20]. The algorithm searches for clusters of points and considers each cluster as one hyperellipsoidal cell in an N-dimensional histogram. Among the advantages of this scheme are: 1) the histogram cell descriptors-location, shape, and size-can be determined adaptively from sequentially introduced data samples of known classification and, 2) the number of cells required for a good fit can usually be held to a small number. No assumptions are required about the underlying statistical structure of the data. The algorithm requires three types of \"control parameters\" which critically affect its performance and are dependent upon the number of dimensions. The three factors control the birth, shape, and growth rate of the cells. Guides were presented in [20] for choosing the control parameter values. These guides functioned well for spaces of 3 dimensions or less, but did not yield usable values for spaces of greater dimensionality. This paper presents heuristics which were developed to automate the selection of the control parameters. The properties of these parameters were studied as a function of dimension. Two of the control parameters were found to be linearly related to dimension. This provides a method for determining their value by extrapolation, thereby avoiding a great deal of computation."
"There is a continuing increase in the use of correlation in engineering. In these applications some or all of the signals to be analyzed may be obscured by noise. Since determination of the autocorrelation or cross correlation requires knowledge of the signals for all time, one must use the observed signals to obtain an estimate of the desired correlation function. These estimates, autocorrelograms or crosscorrelograms, are affected when the signal is obscured by noise. A theoretical investigation of the noise-induced error in correlograms is presented. It is shown that the rms error is inversely proportional to the square root of the record length for virtually any noise which might be encountered. This provides a guide for the reduction of the noise error to any desired level. In addition, bounds on the error are determined for some more common types of noise. Experimental results are described which verify the theoretical developments. The theoretical results are applied to a study of the transmission of action potentials through the cockroach ganglion."
"Some results of a study of the sequential response accuracy exhibited by individual subjects engaged in a particular skilled positioning task requiring discrete open-loop self-paced behavior are presented. The task resembled a discrete self-paced tracking task. A mathematical deterministic discrete model capable of predicting the sign and magnitude of the subject's sequential response error was formulated. This model, based solely on the similarity of previous sequential responses to the required response, contained three coefficients which were fitted to each subject's data by linear regression techniques. There was often a fairly high degree of correlation between a subject's actual and model predicted error. Zero mean error and the presence or absence of the range effect which are observable gross phenomena are direct consequences of the behavior described by the model. Because of the possibility of statistical artifacts, the model was also checked against computerized pseudosubjects whose deterministic and random behavioral components were programmed. The paper is presented as an effort to further basic knowledge of discrete open-loop self-paced behavior and of fine-grain analysis and modeling of the accuracy of skilled sequential responses."
       "In the above paper,1 an optimal method of self-optimization of certain system parameters using noisy binary-valued performance feedback is extended, without losing optimality, to situations with many-valued performance feedback. The effect of time-varying feedback mechanisms is briefly considered."

"Aided by a growing realization of the complexity of the problems involved and stimulated, no doubt, by the spectacular successes of the systems approach in such areas as the space and defense programs, there has been in recent years an increasing interest in the utilization of the systems approach for developmental problems. A survey of the views and activities of some U.N. bodies regarding the application of systems methodologies in their fields of interest is given. The further use of the systems approach for developmental problems is discussed, and the need is seen not only for the adaptation of techniques but also for the development of new and appropriate approaches. The role which the professional community and others can play in stimulating further interest is suggested."
"Industrial societies have evolved under the influence of a political-economic reward system and a technological revolution that literally views the environment as infinite in its waste absorbing capabilities, if not in resource producing capability as well. As such they are not ecologically feasible in the long term. It is precisely their inconsistencies with the laws of material and energy balance under the pressures of an expanding human population that are generating the environmental crisis. The thesis of this paper is that man, as a dominating species on the surface of the earth, must learn to engineer the developments of industry, agriculture, and human habitats, giving explicit consideration to the effects of these developments on the environment. Environmental components are viewed as conceptually similar to industrial production processes, having many possible alternative uses. Since alternative uses are often mutually exclusive, the choice of use is critical. Some of the ecological and sociological considerations implicit in the problems of choice are demonstrated herein along with some of the problems of economic regulation."
"The synchronous longitudinal guidance (SLG) approach to allocating guideway space and controlling traffic in a ground transportation network is described in this paper. The transportation system considered is one in which completely automated vehicles follow deterministic position-time profiles during their travel through the network. The key feature in the SLG approach is a dynamic scheduling algorithm which allocates guideway space to vehicles in such a way that the capacity of critical points (or bottlenecks) in the network is not exceeded. This guarantees that traffic flows smoothly through the entire network and that queues are confined to the entrances. Two scheduling algorithms are Identified in this paper. The basic slot allocation algorithm used in processing vehicle trip requests is outlined first. Then the more general cycle allocation algorithm, which is suitable for control of large networks, is described. The results of a computer simulation of a network run using the latter algorithm are summarized, and the required auxiliary SLG functions of entrance and exit control, merge control, and safety assurance are discussed briefly."
"A class of linear systems is studied which is subject to random failures. In such systems the designer must specify strategies for both control and repair. The dynamic interaction of these two facets of the problem is explored, and it is shown that quick repair permits a reduction in gains in the feedback loop. An algorithm is presented for finding the optimal controller and the best policy of repair."
"Recent developments in modern control theory and high-speed computation techniques have enabled extensive treatment of complex processes. A method is presented for building a model of an R& D process utilizing the state space approach. The specific model described in this paper contains 21 state variables and a control vector of 6 components. Its formulation leads to the Mayer's problem with inequality constraints imposed on the control vector. An algorithm based on the adjoint system technique is used for simultaneous optimization and simplification. The computation for the preceding model lasts 2.5 min and is completed within 5 iterations. It results in an improvement factor of three for the chosen index of performance. Simplification of the model reduces the 21 state variables and 6 control components into 1 state variable and 1 control component."
"A predictive model is presented that represents the human as an information processor by mathematically simulating the results of past psychological research in choice reaction time, memory storage/ retrieval, and perceptual information processing. Both discrimination and identification tasks are characterized by ideal decisions with additive Gaussian noise. In an information processing task both presented and stored information are processed using a sequential dimensional procedure to identify a presented stimulus. This technique is shown to produce a logarithmic variation in response time as a function of the number of stimuli being presented. The model's simulation of a three-dimensional visual identification task was compared with the experimental results of three subjects. The equipment used consisted of a computer-controlled discrete dot display; the dimensions used were horizontal and vertical extent and the percentage of dots present in a given area. It was found that the simulation reflected the subjects' behavior in both decision accuracy and response time for different sets of a priori probabilities."
"Any effective model of a nontrivial portion of the nervous system cannot possibly account in detail for the activity of individual cells. We have developed an approach to modeling cortical systems by taking advantage of the regularities of the macrostructure and the stochastic nature of the spatial microstructure and temporal activity. A gross linear or nonlinear description is found for the local activity of neural tissue. If the local activity can be described by a function which is linear in space and time, then this can be convoluted with any spatiotemporal input pattern to predict the output. When applied to the cerebellar cortex this approach has resulted in a model analogous to an anisotropic spatial filter with interesting temporal properties. The model predicts that the cerebellar cortex will enhance the detail (in space and time) of any input pattern. However, the form of the spatial transfer function depends on the temporal frequency of the input and vice-versa."
"An auditory display in a dual-axis compensatory tracking task was studied. Subjects were presented concurrently with the primary task of controlling a second-order plant and the secondary task of controlling a first-order plant. The plant errors for the two tasks were shown on separate visual displays. An auditory display, whose output varied in frequency and volume with the error, was used to supplement the secondary task in half of the runs. To study the effects of the auditory display, two performance measures were obtained: 1) the integral of the squared error (ISE) and 2) the describing functions of the human operator. Statistical analysis of the ISE measures indicated that when the secondary task was supplemented with an auditory display, there was a significant improvement in performance on the secondary task. The performance on the primary task improved on the average, but not significantly. The variances of the ISE values decreased for both the tasks, indicating a more consistent behavior with the auditory display. The describing function analysis showed that supplementing the secondary task with the auditory display increased the low frequency gain of the human operator for this task. The describing functions for the primary task did not show any apparent changes."
"Thinking in the human brain greatly depends upon association mechanisms which can be utilized in machine intelligence. An associative memory device, called \" Associatron,\" is proposed. The Associatron stores entities represented by bit patterns in a distributed manner and recalls the whole of any entity from a part of it. If the part is large, the recalled entity will be accurate; on the other hand, if the part is small, the recalled entity will be rather ambiguous. Any number of entities can be stored, but the accuracy of the recalled entity decreases as the number of entities increases. The Associatron is considered to be a simplified model of the neural network and can be constructed as a cellular structure, where each cell is connected to only its neighbor cells and all cells run in parallel. From its mechanisms some properties are derived that are expected to be utilized for human-like information processing. After these properties have been analyzed, an Associatron which deals with entities composed of less than 180 bits is simulated by a computer. Simple examples of its applications for concept formation and game playing are presented and the thinking process by the sequence of associations is described."
"An on-line learning control system involving the control of processes whose mathematical description is incomplete or insufficiently known to the controller is investigated. The controller does not identify the process but finds instead from its own accumulated experience a number of points on hypersurfaces which gradually approach the control law of the system. These hypersurfaces are approximated by a number of piecewise linear hyperplanes whose equations are found after occurrence of adequate learning by interpolation methods. Due to the approximations involved, the learned control law is suboptimal. In the case of insufficient information the control vector is calculated by means of various search procedures. The results of simulation of a single-variable and a multivariable learning control system on a digital computer are presented. The results obtained indicate the achievement of adequate control with relatively small memory and real-time requirements. The feasibility of this learning control method is determined by the number of inputs and outputs of the process and the dimension of the measurement vector involved."
"An effective on-line procedure is presented for system identification and state estimation for multiple-input multiple-output linear systems. The proposed solution offers consistent system identification, bounding of the steady-state covariance, and computational savings. Also, this solution is applicable to a larger class of problems than previously proposed solutions."
"The development and comparison of a class of nonparametric probability density function modeling algorithms is presented. Each algorithm Iteratively estimates a model of the sampled density function based upon a description of a set of equiprobable regions over the range of the variable of interest. Minimization of computational complexity and memory capacity while maintaining convergence and stability are the principal considerations. Variations of the algorithms are compared as to rate of convergence and limit cycle stability relative to ease of implementation. Results including comparative curves are presented."
"The convergence properties of a nearest neighbor rule that uses an editing procedure to reduce the number of preclassified samples and to improve the performance of the rule are developed. Editing of the preclassified samples using the three-nearest neighbor rule followed by classification using the single-nearest neighbor rule with the remaining preclassified samples appears to produce a decision procedure whose risk approaches the Bayes' risk quite closely in many problems with only a few preclassified samples. The asymptotic risk of the nearest neighbor rules and the nearest neighbor rules using edited preclassified samples is calculated for several problems."
"One aspect of a new theory of feature perception is considered. An algorithm is presented which can perceive and locate various features of a pattern by analyzing a statistic of the \"chords\" of the pattern. The procedure is illustrated by applying the algorithm to a pattern containing the Muller-Lyer figures. In measuring the length of the figures it is found that the algorithm has a visual illusion. A machine capable of executing the algorithm is described."

"Basic principles of engineering, ecology, and economics are synthesized into logically consistent theoretical and computational procedures for a coordinated multilevel analysis of the tradeoffs in the static mass-energy and economic characteristics of alternate ecosystems (life support systems) and subsystems. Ecologically consistent pricing mechanisms are discussed as a means for regulating physical and technological succession."
"A methodology is presented for developing socioeconomic models of the type formalized by Forrester. A means of including socioeconomic experts into the modeling process is suggested, and it is emphasized that such models are not scientific models but merely assemblages of expert opinion. An iterative numerical scheme based on the technique of \"quasi-linearization\" is described which can be used to adjust model parameters so that the model closely agrees with real data. The methodology is illustrated using a model of the socio economic system of the Lake Tahoe basin in northern California. Such a model may eventually be useful for purposes of environmental planning."
"A greatly simplified version of Forrester's model of an urban area is described. Whereas Forrester's original model contained 20 states and 150 equations, the revised one contains 9 states and 81 equations. This revised model converges to a close approximation to Forrester's equilibrium through similar temporal behavior and produces comparable results when Forrester's 11 urban programs are applied."
"The problems of planning for economic development in the new states of Africa and Asia as well as in the more established countries of Latin America arise from the interplay of the political, social, and economic subsystems of a developing country. In this paper a system simulation model of a developing agricultural economy is presented as one approach to the planning problem. A preliminary model of the agricultural economy of southern Nigeria is described. This model simulates, over time, the impacts of alternative public policies affecting the development of the economy and computes a number of criteria which can aid decision makers in evaluating alternative policies. The model includes five major production enterprises: cocoa, palm products, and rubber (the three important Nigerian perennial, or \"tree,\" crops), annual nonfood crops, and staple foods. The broad organization of the model comprising five basic components is discussed. One of these, the land allocation and modernization component, is described to illustrate specifically: 1) the distributed parameter model of the perennial production processes which simulates the growth and output of \"populations\" of trees under alternative development strategies, and 2) the land use transition decision mechanism. Sensitivity analyses and time series tracking against real world data are conducted to tune the model as part of the validation process. Then, with this coarsely validated but still preliminary model, policy runs are made to test the simulated consequences and real world implications for the economy (e.g., gross domestic product, per capita incomes, nutrition, foreign exchange earnings, etc."
"The applications of computer control in production factories have been extended from the control of mass and energy to the production control. The control at this level comprises the formulation and alteration of work schedules in accordance with the progress of work, and it may be called the control of information. This paper deals with the flow line which is the most fundamental production line in the factory and proposes and verifies the optimal scheduling method. In the case of producing multicommodities by a flow line, the optimum schedule is the one which satisfies the demand for the respective products and minimizes the changeover loss. The branch-and-bound method is used to obtain an optimum schedule. The geometrical characteristics of the region in which the feasible schedules exist are used for calculating the lower bound of the objective function for the subset of feasible schedules."
"A systematic method is proposed for the development, optimization, and comparison of human controller models. The method is suitable for any model, including multiparameter systems. The evaluation criteria for assessing model quality are based on three separate components: 1) the cost or criterion function, 2) the comparison between the input/output functions of the human operator and those of the model, and 3) characteristic values and functions of statistical signal theory (mean values, auto- and crosscorrelation functions, power spectral density functions, and histograms of time function data). A nonlinear multiparameter human operator model is presented which considers the complex input information rate in a single display. The nonlinear features of the model are brought about by a modified threshold element and a decision algorithm. A random search technique is used for parameter optimization. Different display content arrangements as well as various transfer functions of the controlled element are explained by different optimized parameter combinations. The comparison with the well-known quasi-linear describing function for the human operator shows a marked superiority of the nonlinear model."
"The effects of aural and combined aural and visual displays of tracking error on human operator dynamics were investigated using a compensatory tracking task. The aural displays indicated error magnitude with tone pitch and error polarity by either modulating the tone or by switching it between the ears. Describing functions, remnants, and rms tracking performance were measured with test conditions which were similar to those for previous studies of visual tracking performance. Human operator control characteristics measured for aural displays agree closely with those which result for visual displays. Also, operators could control equally well with either one- or two-ear displays. However, the reduction in operator time delays, expected because of the generally faster human response to aural stimuli, was not clearly evident in the results. Results also indicate that the combined aural and visual presentation of tracking error improved operator performance slightly."
"The results of an automated classification of the peripheral blood leukocytes into eight categories are presented. The classification was achieved by means of digital image processing. The categories were: small lymphocytes, medium lymphocytes, large lymphocytes, band neutrophils, segmented neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes. An eight-dimensional multivariate Gaussian classifier was used. The features were extracted from a 50 × 50 point digital image. These features were measures of such visual concepts as nuclear size, nuclear shape, nuclear and cytoplasmic texture, cytoplasm color, and cytoplasm colored texture. The data set consisted of 1041 blood cell images and were divided into a training set of 523 cells and an independent testing set of 518 cells. These cells were digitized directly from the blood smear, which was stained with Wright's stain. Twenty different blood smears were used and were collected over a three-year period from 20 people. The \"true\" classification of the data set was obtained from four experienced hematology technicians. Their performance was compared to the automated classifier both in terms of an absolute classification of cells and in terms of estimating the percentage composition of the population (or the blood cell differential count). The measure of performance used was the percentage error for each class. The mean percentage error for the eight classes in terms of an absolute classification was 8 and 29 percent for the human observers and the automated classiffier, respectively."
"The output of a system is often expressed as a sequence of unary and/or binary operations on the input. Analysis or design considerations may require manipulation of the sequence of operators to obtain an equivalent sequence either mathematically simpler or easier to design. For this purpose, available operator algebra must be considerably expanded. Several new operators are introduced: the multiple operator which is a combination of unary operators, and the zero-convolution and zero-correlation operators. Three commutation tables are developed, one for unary and transform operators, one for binary operators, and one for binary operators operating on two functions already transformed by unary or transform operators. The commutation tables can be used to manipulate and simplify a sequence of operators. They should be useful in the analysis and design of complex systems. This becomes quite clear when one tries to repeat the examples of this paper without using the commutation tables. The simplification of sequence of operators procedure not only permits a faster simplification of multiple integral transformations, but it also provides such a clear picture of the operations to perform that the manipulations become obvious. This contrasts with the conventional technique of rearranging the integrals and performing changes of variables somewhat blindly. Since the purpose of this paper is to make available a practical tool, most of the derivations of the formulas were left out for conciseness."
"Some of the results of a study of asymptotically optimum nonparametric training procedures for two-category pattern classifiers are reported. The decision surfaces yielded by earlier forms of nonparametric training procedures generally do not minimize the probability of error. We derive a modification of the Robbins-Monro method of stochastic approximation, and show how this modification leads to training procedures that minimize the probability of error of a one-dimensional two-category pattern classifier. The class of probability density functions admitted by these training procedures is quite broad. We show that the sequence of decision points generated by any of these training procedures converges with probability one to the minimum-probability-of-error decision point."

"Before one can engage in the formation of national goals, or for that matter personal goals, we must first determine where we are and how we arrived at that point. Such was the major thread of the workshop titled \"Toward a Framework for National Goals.\" The workshop emerged through the general frustration and apparent malaise of the scientific and technical community as a consequence of the recent reordering of national priorities and the general public's challenges hurled due to the negative impact of technology on society. The felt need was to ascertain if there was a means of developing a channel through which inputs could be made at the local, national, and international levels in relation to goals formulation. What became immediately apparent was that there existed no common conceptual framework or language through which values could be discussed as they related to goals, and hence goals formulation was not feasible in this context. The papers that form the basis of this special section were developed in response to specific invitation and were circulated in advance of the workshop. They served as points of departure for discussion through a common information base. The format which ensued was that of planary sessions interspersed with small group meetings leading to a final planary session. The outcome of the first planary session and panel discussion was the formulation of the four questions: \"Where are we now?\" \"How did we get here?\", \"How do we like it?\", and \"What can we do?\" These served as the organizing theme against which the group took on the task of developing a framework for goals formulation."
"This paper describes four common postures in writings on values and technology. These are called: the Luddite, the technocratic, the apocalyptic, and the \"cautionary moral sermon.\" These positions are considered to be legitimate, but lacking in both instrumental significance or adequacy of their conceptualizations of human values. A discussion of values in the framework of a rudimentary decision theory is then presented. This leads to a consideration of several paradoxes involving values-one based on the dimension of time, another based on the shift from individual to collective values, and the third based on the exchange of one type of value fbr another as problems are solved. These paradoxes are offered as partial justification for a fifth perspective on the relation between values and technology: that of the \"curious, hopeful, and sometimes astonished observer.\""
"The authors discuss the general relationships between technology and personal and social values. They attempt to stimulate consideration by individuals and societies of the changing judgments and ethics now required both for the engineering profession and individual engineers. They suggest that values and actions in the social environment are symbolic and that most of our present institutions are responsive to an environment of the rather distant past. Laissez-faire, the Adam Smith \"hidden hand,\" and \"caveat emptor\" no longer can be the guiding principles of a technology or of an affluent social system."
"This paper is a brief report and reflection on a three-year study of the social-psychological problems involved in changing public organizations so that they are able to perform social, particularly urban, long-range planning. It reviews the philosophy of the study, the present state of long-range planning, planned-change literature and its implications, and some issues in organizational transformation."
"Science by itself has no impact on society. Its impact is mediated through the professions, all of which are concerned with design in some sense. Science and technology are both option-generating processes, and the options have a high mortality. It is only the application of technology in a replicative process that is option-choosing and commits us to its social consequences. Social systems do not conform to traditional systems analysis. They do not have single objective functions. They exhibit conflicting and internally inconsistent goals. Systems analysis which aims to incorporate society as part of the system must incorporate these conflicts and inconsistencies as part of the analysis. Paretian environmental analysis and Allison's models of governmental decision-making are described as illustrating how the concepts of systems analysis might be broadened to take into account the response of social groups and bureaucratic structures to technocratic plans. If engineers are to bring systems thinking to bear on social problems, they must learn how to incorporate social and political theory into their analytical framework ab initio."
"Discontinuous change of institutions, values, concepts, etc. is the characteristic of the world today. In the face of this discontinuous change the methods of goal setting remain essentially unchanged in the traditional steady-state mold. In times of transition such as now we must be able to learn how to handle large quantities of unstructured and unfamiliar information, often qualitative in nature, which exceeds the capacity of the unaided human mind. The hallmark of our present society is the success of science and technology in meeting our dated social goal. This, in turn, has caused the absolute need for reexamination of the values and goals in relationship to science and technology. Yet, no new guide for this reexamination has yet been proposed. What we offer here is a viable alternative to steady-state resolutions-transition management. This approach to resolving the issues of value differences in times of discontinuous change is based on the premise that solutions to problems during transition can be attained effectively only if value differences are made explicit. The major elements in the management of discontinuous change require skills in supportive confrontation and conceptual mapping. These skills lead to making values explicit and then to the development of new insights and value relationships. This leads to the cognitive reformation of previously held value patterns and to emergent solutions to otherwise insoluble conflicts."
"If modern technology is to impact successfully on a significant social problem, the quantitative model must lead to a finite set of alternatives, each clearly referenced to its social, economic, and political constraints. From such alternatives, priorities must be established by the political process-it is at this step that the major current impediment to progress occurs. The engineering community carries the responsibility of elucidating the specific decisions which the public must make."
"Quantitative information and factual indicators are essential for informed decision-making, and science and technology policy-making is no exception. However, there are no social indicators as there are economic indicators. Direct measures which relate to technological accomplishments are almost impossible to obtain. Analogies and anecdotes are the arguments used for programs proposed in problem areas rather than specific measures or specific indicators which permit the evaluation of the effectiveness of the program. In addition to the lack of quantitative data, there are economic and institutional practices and regulations on an international, or state and local level that often act as powerful nontechnical barriers to technological enhancement and change. These include state highway regulations, state building codes, tax rates and structures, the patent system, restrictive application of anti-trust and trade regulation, absence of and inadequacy of nonperformance based standards, and subsidies and tariffs. The methods of scientific investigation and the social engineering called systems analysis which have been primarily successful in the solution of military and space problems have important roles to play in this area. They can provide the framework for the determination of the particular types of qualitative information needed to measure the nation's social health."
"The domain of interest is goal formation and policy planning at the national level. A preliminary research framework for analysis of national policy alternatives is defined. Included are the following basic elements: values, goals, attainments, strategies, societal processes, and societal indicators. Using this conceptual structure as a point of departure, an outline is given of the principal research problems to be addressed. Other possible applications of the framework and model are also described."
"Program planning begins with problem definition and ends with planning for action. The key products that result from the problem definition, value system design, and system synthesis steps are discussed and interrelated through the use of interaction matrices. Particular emphasis is given to defining objectives and to defining a set of measures on the objectives by which to determine their attainment. Interaction matrices relate objectives measures to objectives and link activities and measures of their accomplishment to the attainment of objectives. A major consequence of program planning is the choice of a program to pursue, and identification of the projects that will be carried out as a part of a selected program. Selecting the set of projects is discussed in terms of consistency with corporate or agency policy, and the economics, risk, and potential benefits associated with each project. A criterion function that incorporates the latter three factors is described and proposed as a practical way of evaluating the relative merits of projects."
"Considerable interest currently exists in the application of the systems approach to the solution of societal, political, and environmental problems. The essence of this systems approach is modeling, the capability to describe large-scale complicated interactive systems by symbolic representations so that inferences regarding the effects of alternative system configurations can be easily and rapidly structured. The modeling process is itself becoming better understood as a direct extension of the scientific method. Furthermore, the applicability of statistical methodology to the design and analysis of experiments with computerized symbolic models is leading to wider acceptance of these representations as tools of considerably credible scientific stature. This paper presents a taxonomy of 24 model categories and, in a discussion of the scientific method and the modeling process, indicates the evaluations pertinent to the selection of a modeling medium appropriate to particular systems studies. The dynamic stochastic simulation model is shown to be the most general category of symbolic models which are amenable to facile organized experimentation. The application of such models to the understanding and solution of societal, political, psychological, medical, judicial, environmental, social, economic, and biological problems is indicated and is considered imminently practicable."
"A control stick with a built-in kinesthetic-tactile compensatory display, which was used to give a driver information concerning his state with respect to the nearest lead vehicle, was tested in several full-scale car-following situations. System performance was evaluated for several display excitation signals by means of average tracking measures (headway variance and relative velocity variance), system dynamic response as evidenced by describing-function models, and subjects' opinion ratings. The average tracking performance and dynamic response of a driver-vehicle system, as well as a driver's workload, were substantially modified by providing him with aiding information. More consistent dynamic performance among driver-subjects was obtained, and it was established that part of the driving workload can be effectively shared by an automatic system."
"From a practical standpoint most dynamic response analysis techniques are complicated, expensive, and time consuming to mechanize and operate. These techniques usually require digital or special-purpose analog equipment, and the computations are often performed sometime after data are collected. Adaptive paramater tracking techniques partially overcome these faults: but they either have prescribed forms, which is an undesirable restriction for basic research, or in the case of free-form methods the computational requirements become excessive. To overcome these drawbacks, an on-line Fourier analysis technique has been developed which deals only with the input and error signals in a manual feedback control system. Several sine waves are used for the input, and the on-line data measurement includes the error variance and a simple means for obtaining the sine and cosine transforms of the error signal at each of the input frequencies. From this relatively small amount of data, we show simple ways to compute the open- and closed-loop dynamic response at input frequencies and the relative amount of linearly correlated power in the error signal. This paper describes the rationale and theory for the technique and discusses two methods for mechanizing it; one involving standard analog computer components and one based on conventional electromechanical components. Finally, a typical application of this method is presented."
"The dynamic behavior of randomly connected analog neuron-like elements that process pulse-frequency modulated signals is investigated from the macroscopic point of view. By extracting two statistical parameters, the macroscopic state equations are derived in terms of these parameters under some hypotheses on the stochastics of microscopic states. It is shown that a random net of statistically symmetric structure is monostable or bistable, and the stability criteria are explicitly given. Random nets consisting of many different classes of elements are also analyzed. Special attention is paid to nets of randomly connected excitatory and inhibitory elements. It is shown that a stable oscillation exists in such a net-in contrast with the fact that no stable oscillations exist in a net of statistically symmetric structure even if negative as well as positive synaptic weights are permitted at a time. The results are checked by computer-simulated experiments."
"A large-scale system is considered as a system constituted of subsystems which may be connected or disconnected from each other during operation. A new concept of connective stability is introduced by which a large-scale system is regarded as stable if it remains stable (in the sense of Lyapunov) under structural perturbations produced by the on-off participation of the subsystems. Algebraic conditions are developed that guarantee exponential connective stability of large-scale systems which may be composed of linear and nonlinear time-varying subsystems coupled by linear or nonlinear connections."
      "The results stated in the above paper1 concerning an approved stochastic approximation method are considered. Formulas for the variances of the estimates are derived, and it is found that, in fact, the new algorithm is inferior to previously suggested ones."

"A technique for making fixed-frequency or wide-band real-time measurements of reflection coefficients, transmission coefficients, and fields in open or closed structures at UHF and microwave frequency is given. The basic system uses two isolated channels, which originate from a common CW source, and one channel is single-sideband modulated. These two signals are then added and mixed in a (homodyne) detector, and the detected signal at the modulation frequency displays the desired amplitude and phase information in real time simultaneously and independently. The sources of inherent phase and amplitude errors are considered, including those due to the unwanted sidebands created by imperfect modulation. Operation on the linear portion of the characteristic curve of a balanced detector tends to reduce these errors and increase the dynamic operating range. The system sensitivity should approach -110 to -120 dBm, and dynamic operating ranges of the order of 100 to 110 dB are possible."
"When a coil is placed in proximity to a conductor, the magnetic field in the vicinity of the coil is altered by eddy currents in the conductor. The conductivity of a sample material may be determined by measuring the field. Closed-form solutions are presented for the magnetic field at the surface of a semi-infinite conductor for two cases: a semi-infinite coil, the end of which is in contact with the conductor, and a loop of wire on the surface of the conductor."
"A new generalized analysis is presented of operating characteristics of phase-sensitive detector circuits, assuming that the input signal and the reference wave are in the presence of independent, stationary, and additive Gaussian noise. The generalized criteria are determined for the detector optimum operating conditions and for minimization of the detector characteristic essential nonlinearities by means of computer-aided analysis, using high-density discrete value calculations. The results of the analysis are given in normalized form and can be directly applied to evaluate in detail the detector-circuit performance and characteristic essential nonlinearities over a wide dynamic range of operating conditions. Furthermore, particular emphasis is laid on the determination of optimum detector-circuit operating conditions in contemporary instrumentation systems."
"A computer-operated transmission measurement set intended to support development work on microwave components for FM radio systems in the 3700-4200-MHz range is described. The instrument is capable of measuring the complete S-parameter set of the device under test, over a range from 20-dB gain to 70-dB loss. Accuracies of transmission parameters for small loss are ±0.002 dB, ±0.01°, and ±0.1 ns. The basic measurement technique is that of \"IF substitution,\" combined with rapid cyclic comparison (30-Hz rate) of the parameters of the unknown with those of a stable microwave reference. The comparison feature eliminates errors from circuit drift, thus allowing attainment of the high accuracies sought. The test set design, the control of error sources, and the validation of accuracy are discussed."
"An IC single-sideband modulator is described that allows direct measurement of magnitude and phase of a voltage over 3 decades anywhere in the range 10 Hz to 1 MHz. Two modulators generate a leveled upper-sideband (USB) reference signal about a 1-MHz suppressed carrier acceptable to the HP 8405A vector voltmeter. Another modulator produces a double-sideband (DSB) replica of the output voltage of the test device. The vector voltmeter then measures the magnitude of the upper-sideband reference and test device signals and their phase difference."
"An account is given of the krypton 85 test for determining leak rates of tubes evacuated to a pressure of ~10-8 torr. The minimum detectable air leak rate is of the order of 10-12 atm cc s-1, the limit being set by the background radiation and by the inaccuracy of dispensing a known-activity calibration standard. A description is given of the soak procedure and of the operation and calibration of two alternative counting equipments. An essential requirement for unambiguous counting is the facility for efficient removal of unwanted contamination that adheres to the exterior surface of the tube as a result of the soak. Determination of the optimum cleaning process is, of course, a matter for experiment, and must be proved for each particular application."
"A numerical method of linearizing a dc thermistor thermometer in which the power dissipated by the thermistor is sufficient to heat itself to a temperature significantly above ambient is developed and tested. It is shown that if the dissipation constant of the thermistor remains fixed, then the thermometer is able to detect temperature fluctuations considerably smaller than the internal temperature rise above ambient of the thermistor itself."
"Experience from experiments with a sample and hold circuit showed that dielectric absorption constitutes a fundamental limitation of the accuracy in analog memories. To gain more insight into the problem several materials commonly used as dielectrics in capacitors have been investigated. The theory of dielectric absorption is discussed. Results from measurements on capacitors with paper, cellulose acetate, parylene, polyester, polycarbonate, and polystyrene dielectrics are reported. The components in Dow's model, which describes the dielectric absorption, are calculated for the polycarbonate dielectric. A compensation circuit is suggested, which considerably reduces the effect of dielectric absorption in analog memories and electronic integrators."
"The need for an instrument that measures the bubble distribution in a flow is well documented by the numerous studies that are conducted on cavitation inception and cavitation damage to materials. The present measurement techniques do not provide a complete solution to these problems. In this short paper, we have developed an instrument that determines the bubble-size distribution by measuring the intensity of light scattered from the bubbles. Bubbles in the range of 0.005 to 0.04 in in diameter were measured with this method. The lower limit of this range can be extended by decreasing the factors that contribute noise to the measurement."
"A temperature-monitoring system for use on normal newborn infants is described. The device serves to alert the hospital staff to temperature excursions beyond an acceptable range."
"A principle for measurement of capacitance is shown, together with a practical realization. The inherent linearity of output voltage as function of capacitance makes the principle advantageous for the evaluation of capacitance transducers."
"A position-detection system utilizing a chemical array is described. The array uses a continuous layer of inorganic compound in a resin material as the sensing medium, thus eliminating the element spacings that are the primary cause of error in discrete arrays with inactive gaps. The analysis of a one-dimensional chemical array with mechanical image perturbation is presented. Zero error-position detection is obtained with triangular image perturbation."
"A monostable multivibrator, triggered by pulses of constant frequency, can be used as a bridge circuit either with capacitance or resistance transducers. The output voltage of the monostable multivibrator bridge is a linear function of transducer impedance. Sensitivity is four times higher compared with the Wheatstone bridge."
"An analog signal with a bandwidth up to 100 MHz is temporarily stored in a relatively inexpensive analog buffer consisting of an oscilloscope screen image on the target layer of a vidicon tube. From this buffer 255 samples are taken, digitized (seven bits sample), and transferred to a digital computer or averager with a rate of 15 000 samples/s. The fastest fill time of the analog buffer is 50 ns, so the minimum time between consecutive samples of the analog input signal corresponds to 2 χ 10-10 s. A modified apparatus could be used to digitize on paper or film recorded curves, etc."
"The power transient monitor is a specialized electric equipment developed to provide the capability of automatically and unattendedly recording randomly occurring power transients and disturbances in electric power systems. Twelve magnetic data channels record power waveforms and 14 pulse-voltage counters register the occurrence of pulse-voltage transients according to magnitude and duration. The power waveforms are continuously recorded and erased from a rotating magnetic drum. When a transient is sensed, a record signal is provided to a quick-start magnetic tape whereupon pretransient, transient, and post-transient waveforms are transcribed from the drum onto the tape. The time of each recording is also indicated on the tape. The waveform recordings can be viewed on an oscilloscope or reproduced on an oscillograph. Representative transient recordings made with the monitor at six widely separated continental and overseas field installations are presented."
"High-resolution position detection using a one-dimensional zero-dead-band photosensor receptor has been shown [1] to be possible by applying a high-frequency triangular perturbation to a normalized target image. It is shown here that for a nonzero dead-band δ between the receptor elements, position detection becomes increasingly uncertain as δ increases. By periodically changing the magnitude of the perturbation and the system gain, it is shown that accurate position detection is still possible for a receptor with nonzero dead-band."
"Outputs of a Gray code counter are used to synthesize digital Walsh functions that are free from hazards. This method, which produces sequency-ordered Walsh functions, also uses a binary code to select the order."

"The history of atomic and molecular frequency control will be traced from the earliest molecular beam magnetic resonance experiments in 1938 through the present."
"Recently we reported the operation of an optically pumped 85Rb maser oscillating at 3.035734 GHz on the field-independent transition 52S1/2(F = 3, mF = 0 → F = 2, mF = 0) [1]. Apart from cavity pulling, the two major sources of frequency shifts are those due to the buffer gas and the pumping light. The short-term phase stability of the standard is not appreciably affected by these shifts. The buffer-gas shift can be used to advantage to select an output frequency that is different from the ground-state hyperfine frequency."
"The density measurement of liquid hydrogen and two-phase mixtures of liquid and gaseous hydrogen is considered. This paper describes a complete prototype system that uses an open-ended microwave cavity for making dynamic density measurements of flowing hydrogen in a transfer line. The theory of operation along with test results for both the single- and two-phase cases are presented and discussed."
"The behavior of an electron beam in a large drift space is analyzed. The distortion of a signal modulated on the beam is considered after drift through a space of the order of several meters in length. Distortion of pulse modulation and smear of sinusoidal modulation are examined."
"The analysis and design of an underwater acoustic velocimeter employing a high-frequency CW resonance technique is presented. It is shown that such an instrument achieves high sensitivity and resolution and is believed to be relatively immune to the effects of turbulence. The analysis is illustrated by a prototype design giving a sensitivity of 84 Hz/ft/s of sound velocity."
"Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) is used to specify the structural return loss and structural transmission loss that are caused by the randomly spaced electrically short structural defects that are present in commercially available coaxial cables. The theory for the statistical prediction of these effects is presented and TDR methods for making measurements are described. The results should be of particular interest in telephony and CATV applications."
"A generalized equation is derived that represents relations between properties of a device under test and an indication of a measuring instrument having signal generators and an input port. The equation can be applied to most narrow-band radiometers or reflection-measuring instruments. Considering only factors measured outside the instrument, the equation permits exact measurements of properties of the device under test or easier evaluation of errors in the measurements without any consideration of structures or inner properties of the instrument. In addition, according to this concept, a new method permitting direct measurements of mismatch factors or delivered powers and a possibility of a radiometer to be used for reflection measurements are suggested."
"The effect of random image perturbation on the measurement of line length and area using discrete photosensitive arrays is presented. It is shown that two-dimensional independent Gaussian perturbation can linearize the response of area measurement systems employing arrays with elements of small active area."
"A new approach to the digital measurement of angular velocity is presented. This new instrument performs the division by time that has been carefully avoided in the existing instruments. The accuracy and resolution of the transducer does not depend upon the number of quantizations/revolution. The measurements can be made in a very short time, leading to up to 14700 samples per second. An important feature of this instrument is that even at speeds close to zero (or at zero), the error is less than 0.02 percent and 1600 samples of the angular velocity can be obtained/second. This makes the instrument particularly suitable for the study and control of the transient behavior of motors and other rotating devices."
"A simple pulse generator can be constructed using IC gates. Such a pulse generator is described and its use to construct edge-triggered flip-flops is demonstrated. A flip-flop for use in a phase comparator is described. Desirable and undesirable characteristics for this application are discussed and examples of R-S and J-K flip-flops given."
"The vibrating capacitor to be discussed consists of a metalized membrane, clamped at its edges, between two electrodes. The membrane is driven by an RF electric field (309 kHz), which is amplitude modulated at the natural frequency (6 kHz) of the membrane. This RF field is caused by a voltage applied to one of the electrodes, which, together with the membrane, forms the driving capacitor. The other electrode, and the membrane, constitute the vibrating capacitor. A special RF oscillator has been designed, of which an essential part is the driving capacitor. This capacitor causes the RF voltage to be amplitude modulated at the natural frequency of the membrane. The oscillation conditions of this electromechanical system are derived from the equation of motion of the membrane and the electrical properties of the driving circuit. An oscillator circuit with optimum performance is designed with the aid of a computer. Finally, the computed results are verified by measurements."
"The capability of accurately determining the value of impedance discontinuities in transmission line systems is obtained by replacing the dc pulse with a gated RF source in a conventional time-domain reflectometer (TDR) system. Such a system allows complex impedance measurements to be made upon elements in a system that are physically inaccessible. Due to the sensitivity available in TDR systems, low orders of magnitude of return losses are easily detectable and measurable. In systems where multiple impedance discontinuities exist, each individual discontinuity may be isolated and hence analyzed separately. The modifications to a conventional TDR system are described in this paper. A method of using the modified narrow-band TDR system to measure complex impedance is presented. This method is complementary to that used by the Hewlett-Packard model 1580A narrow-band TDR and offers the avantages of both phase information and lower modulation frequency."
"In applications of time-domain spectrometry, in which frequency-domain information is obtained by means of Fourier transformation of time-domain excitation and response signals, results are often required at a number M of evenly spaced frequencies, where M is considerably smaller than N, the number of amplitude samples from which the discrete Fourier transform is formed. Under such conditions the modified form of fast Fourier transformation described offers markedly greater computing efficiency than the standard form."
"The feature selection problem associated with a reading machine for the blind is considered. A multistrategy concept is introduced to permit generalization of the feature set. An example is presented to illustrate the concept."
"A symmetric and accurate triangular waveform generating circuit is described. A simple approach in maintaining the symmetry and linearity of triangular waveform is made by using a single constant current generator to alternately charge and discharge a capacitor in a linear manner. This features perfect symmetry of the waveform over a wide frequency range while maintaining amplitude constancy. The circuit also provides square waveforms of equal on and off periods with rise and fall times of the order of a few nanoseconds. Continuous variation of frequency of the waveform generated is possible by changing a single parameter and it is feasible to have linear, exponential, or logarithmic modulation of frequency. It can be used as a triangle-square waveform generator and as a triangle-to-sine converter with the addition of a few components."
"The response of a seismic motion transducer to a nonharmonic input is studied by analog simulation. Criteria are found for the measurement of triangular, square-wave, and single-pulse inputs. It is shown that a slightly damped system yields better transient response than one with the commonly used damping ratio (0.6-0.7). Recommendations are given for transducers with optional frequency and transient response."
"By terminating the discharge of energy into an insensitive electroexplosive device, firing-energy parameters can be determined. A simple capacitor-discharge system providing exponential pulses terminated at an adjustable width is described. Basic theory and application to testing are discussed."

"This paper deals with the problem of calculating the parallel resistance of a 100: 1 series-parallel buildup of four-terminal resistors with accuracy as high as possible. A rather complex equivalent circuit has been assumed, taking into account all the causes of significant errors. Then a complete calculation has been carried out for obtaining all the error terms expressed by means of 15 relatively synthetic formulas. The method of solving the problem that has been developed is a new one and allows 1) rather simple calculations even if the network is complex, and 2) an immediate separation of the error terms from the main value (in fact, the result is given directly as the sum of a base value and a set of perturbations). The method is based on applying Cohn's theorem and using certain symmetries that have been put in evidence in the equivalent circuit. The perturbations may be considered either as corrections or as uncertainties. Very simple formulas are given for the means and the standard deviations of the errors, the perturbations being considered as uncertainties, and it being assumed that the causes of error are independent of each other and normally distributed. Anyway, these formulas may conveniently be used for initial investigation on the magnitudes of the errors before applying the more complex formulas that give the exact values of the variations. Finally, as an example, results of computations carried out on a particular buildup box are reported."
"A precise method is given for measuring the transconductance of an MOS transistor (MOST) and also its value and rate of variation. The measuring setup uses a differential amplifier, in which the output voltage of a sample MOST operated as a common-source amplifier is compared with the reference voltage derived from the attenuators used as a standard, and also a synchronous demodulator, with which the difference signal obtained from the differential amplifier is converted into corresponding dc voltage used in determining the null point. The transconductance from the 0.1 to 100-m℧ range is measured with an accuracy of less than two percent, over the frequency range of 0.1-10 kHz. The transconductance variation in excess of 1 μ℧ and also the percentage variation of transconductance in excess of 0.2 percent for an MOST with a transconductance of 1 m℧ is measured. Measured examples are also given."
"Assuming a Lorentzian shape for the atomic line, we calculate the cavity-pulling factors of passive frequency standards, taking into account the modification of the applied electromagnetic field by the atomic radiation. The calculation is therefore valid for all values of the gain of the atomic medium and gives, in particular, the cavity-pulling factor when the oscillation threshold is approached. The effect of saturation of the line by the field is included. Two expressions of the cavity-pulling factor are derived. One applies when the electromagnetic field level in the cavity is measured, and the other when the population of the atomic levels is analyzed. Consequences of these results are discussed. An experimental verification of the theoretical results is given, when the resonance of the field level in a hydrogen maser cavity is monitored in conditions where the oscillation threshold is approached."
"For the purpose of checking very fast time-domain reflectometer (TDR) systems it is desirable to have a fast rise-time pulse whose parameters are known. A means for obtaining pulses meeting these requirements has been achieved by suitably tapering the inner conductor of a rigid coaxial transmission line having air dielectric, commonly referred to as an air line. The air line is driven with a pulse that has a very fast rise time compared to the rise time of the expected output pulse. A reflected pulse will be generated whose shape is dependent upon the taper of the inner conductor. A procedure is outlined for determining the proper taper to shape the leading edge of the reflected pulse to match any continuous single-valued function. Air lines that were designed and built for producing a pulse whose leading edge is a linear ramp, a truncated Gaussian function, and the integral of a truncated Gaussian function are discussed and traces of these pulses are shown. The problem of re-reflections due to the multiple discontinuities along the air line was analyzed by means of a computer. This program is described. The effect of the driving-pulse parameters on the reflected pulse is analyzed on a theoretical basis. Rise time, pulse shape, and aberrations such as overshoot and ringing of the driving pulse are considered in this analysis."
"The shuttle-pulse method has been used to measure the attenuation characteristics of the circular waveguide for millimeter-wave transmission. However, the measured results by the shuttle-pulse method cannot avoid some errors when there are periodic imperfections along the waveguide axis. To remove this shortcoming the pulse single-reflection method was developed in the Electrical Communication Laboratory, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation. This paper describes measured results using these two methods. It is confirmed that the measured results are in good agreement with each other when the waveguide has no periodic imperfections. But the attenuation measured by the shuttle-pulse method is smaller than the pulse single-reflection method, when there are periodic imperfections. These results are also theoretically confirmed. The pulse singlereflection method is shown and recommended as a reliable measuring method to determine circular waveguide line loss."
"This paper describes a typical direct-detection noise-measuring system, with particular attention given to the use of Schottky-barrier diodes as envelope detectors. The rise of threshold at low modulation frequencies encountered in these systems has been found to be mainly attributable to FM-to-AM conversion occurring in comparatively narrow-band detectors rather than to diode-flicker noise and thus is largely removable. A sensitivity improvement of 10-20 dB may result at low frequencies, yielding a noise-to-carrier ratio threshold range of about -150 to -155 dB/100 Hz at modulation frequencies from 100 Hz to 50 kHz for measurements of AM noise, and below 0.01 Hz/100 Hz for FM noise, of microwave oscillators at C band."
"An original solution of the system for generating high stable frequency of square-wave oscillation using an RC bridge network as the timing element is given. The high stability of the system is based on the property of self-compensation. With respect to the action of external factors (voltage supply or temperature changes), the system provides a correlation between the variation in two neighboring half-periods, so the prolongation in one half-period affects the shortening of the next with an outstanding tendency to keep the duration of the oscillation period unchanged. In this way the oscillation frequency stability is reduced to the passive RC bridge element and stability of an order 10-4 in practical solutions can be achieved."
"An elegant method is presented for measuring the drain-source conductance of an MOST operating in the saturated current region. The measuring setup allows measurement of the drain-source conductance ranging from 10-3 to 1 mU with a sensitivity of less than 0.1 percent at a frequency of 1 kHz and also measurement of the variation rate in the drain-source conductance in excess of 0.2 percent. The lower limit to the measuring range of the drain-source conductance is widened from 10-3 to 10-5 mU when an FET preamplifier is used as a front end of a comparator in which signal voltage proportional to the drain-source conductance is compared with the reference voltage. This lower conductance range can be used in measuring the drainsource conductance of an MOST operating near the cutoff point."
"A method is presented for evaluating the conductivity and permittivity spectrum of materials by using time-domain reflectometry. A theoretical analysis of the transient response is made, with emphasis on the asymptotic behavior for large values of time. The results of the asymptotic analysis are the basis of the presented method and are essential for the evaluation of the permittivity spectrum of conductive materials. Quite satisfactory experinental results are presented."
"This paper describes a simple method for the calculation of errors due to the finite length and separation of X-array hot-wire anemometers. Results of computations for a typical wire array are presented for total and spectral turbulence measurements. Although the actual errors are slightly underestimated due to the simplifying assumptions used to reduce the computational effort, it is found that the wire length and separation effect is very significant. The analysis does not require complete correlation or spectral functions of the flow and includes the effect of nonuniform wire sensitivity."
"This paper describes a new concept for compensating for sensitivity changes of a differential transformer due to variations in temperature and excitation conditions. The idea is based on utilization of the individual outputs from the secondary coils, not only as a differential output but also as a reference output. The differential transformer usually has two secondary coils connected in opposition to obtain a differential output. If the voltages induced in the individual secondary coils e1 and e2 are individually taken out and if the operation (e1 - e2)/(e1 + e2), is carried out, then the result becomes independent of temperature and excitation conditions. The experiments, which were made to confirm the effectiveness of this method, gave quite impressive and hopeful results: superior temperature, excitation independence and linearity."
"A direct digital method of measuring the noise power in a low-pass random waveform is described. The input-output relationship and the sensitivity of the digital detector are determined. Direct digital measurement of noise power offers a number of advantages in the instrumentation of radiometers and other noise-measuring systems."
"A method of calibrating a potentiometer, at the part-per-million level with a minimum of special-purpose equipment, is described. The technique is illustrated by application to a particular instrument with numerical values drawn from a particular calibration. The required accuracies are shown to be attainable with usual laboratory equipment."
"Because of the increasing interest in time and frequency dissemination via television signals, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) has sponsored an experiment using an active time and frequency code transmitted on a U. S. television network encompassing nationwide coverage. Some history of the project is given. The format of the television code and the equipment necessary to generate and decode the transmitted information are discussed. Statistical results of system stability from New York City, New York, to Boulder, Colorado, and to Los Angeles, California, are presented, and comparisons are made with earlier observations using the passive line-10 television time synchronization technique and the 3.58-MHz color-burst frequency reference used for colorcasts. Analysis of the frequency-transfer capability is presented, and the ability of a phase-locked oscillator to lock to the code's frequency reference is discussed. With the decoder's oscillator in a locked condition, plots of phase with respect to time, time domain stability using the Allan variance, and spectral noise reveal that the system permits calibration of a remote standard to one part in 1011 within one-half hour. Long-term stability (several days) is typically a few parts in 1012. Using an active time code, short-term stability is governed to a noticeable degree by the television industry's standard video format. Finally, a schematic diagram, with discussion, outlines how time-of-day information can be extracted from the television code used in this experiment."
"Crystal-controlled oscillators are commonly used to provide the stable frequencies required for electronic communications, navigation, and data processing systems. Depending upon the frequency of operation, ambient conditions, and specific oscillator design, crystal-controlled oscillators are capable of providing frequency stability varying from about 1 × 10-4 to 1 × 10-11 over time periods ranging from milliseconds to years. The specification and/or description of the performance characteristics of crystal-controlled oscillators has remained a source of misunderstanding and dissatisfaction for both supplier and user, due largely to a lack of standard nomenclature and definitions as applied to crystal-controlled oscillators. It is the objective of this paper to summarize some of the performance characteristics of crystal-controlled oscillators, to propose a suitable terminology for their description, and to suggest the important parameters that should be included in any crystal-oscillator specification."
"A noncontacting measurement system for determining com-plex values of dielectric constant from measured values of complex reflection coefficient is described. A convenient graphical method for relating real and imaginary parts of dielectric constant to measured values and errors in the measured values of reflection coefficient is given."
"A simple method of measuring the induced 60-Hz electric potential in points near HV lines is described. The free potential is related to the charging current of a grounded conducting sphere placed in the field. Measured and calculated values of potential agree well."
"A system is introduced for the acquisition of analog or digital data from a large number of remote sensors and its transmission and collection at a central processing facility. The system features buffering or impedance matching of the signal source, fundamental noise immunity to radiated and ground noise, integral power supplied along the signal lines, as well as fundamental ease of signal switching."
"In this paper a microwave system for attenuation measurement by means of the modulated subcarrier method supplying additional information on the actual parameters of the system is described. The information can be used for automatic control of output signal indicator sensitivity making the results independent of the instability of these parameters. Experimental results are reported illustrating the validity of the analysis."
"A new data processor is presented giving a precise approximation to linear interpolation. The processor produces a staircase waveform with a constant and high number of steps connecting two consecutive samples. The implementation of the interpolator is described and some test results are given."
"This paper describes a time-ordered precision ranging system, identified as time synchronized ranging system (TSRS). The TSRS is a cooperative ranging system serving up to 1024 users within an operational community. Synchronization of time, relative to a designated controller, is established and maintained to less than 7 ns. Slant range measurements between users and controller are provided with a measurement accuracy of 21 ft, one sigma for ranges up to 100 nmi. The synchronization and range-measurement process also provides a high speed, real time, two-way data link between members of the community including relay capabilities where required. Automatic unit identification is provided by means of user time slot assignments. Design features of interest include ultra-high-speed digital logic, digital filtering (Kalman) of time-error measurements with optimal correction of both frequency and phase of a 100-MHz precision source. The TSRS has been tested both in surface communities and surface-air communities and is currently under test by the U. S. Navy."

    "The experimental equipment and procedure used in the latest National Physical Laboratory (NPL) ac Josephson effect determinations of 2e/h are described. The most recent value, obtained in April 1972, is 483 594.00 (±0.10) GHZ/VNPL and this, together with earlier results, provides information concerning the stability of the NPL maintained voltage standard over the past two years. To obtain a further increase in precision, new equipment is being developed for the measurements in which the resistive divider and null detector are maintained at cryogenic temperatures."
"In this paper, an experimental setup is described with which the stability of the PTB voltage standard, consisting of a group of International Weston cells, can be monitored with a total uncertainty (1σ) of 4 parts in 108 by means of the ac Josephson effect. The measured quotient of the fundamental constants 2e/h is given by 2e/h = (483 593.606 ± 0.020) GHZ/VPTB, May 1972."
"Using temperature-regulated transportable standard-cell enclosures, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), under the auspices of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), during the period June 1971 through June 1972 has carried out a series of direct comparisons of the units of voltage as-maintained by NBS and BIPM, Sèvres, France; the National Physical Laboratory, United Kingdom; the National Research Council, Canada; the National Standards Laboratory, Australia; and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Germany. The main purpose of these comparisons was to provide a sound basis for intercomparing values of 2e/h obtained at the various national laboratories via the ac Josephson effect in superconductors. It was found that when converted to a common unit of voltage, most measured values of 2e/h agreed with each other to within the 1 to 2 parts in 107 estimated uncertainty (1 standard deviation) of the volt comparisons. This satisfying result would seem to indicate that serious consideration should be given to adopting a single international value of 2e/h for use in maintaining units of voltage."
"In order to improve the characteristics of standard cells, those containing composite amalgam electrode have been studied. The criterion and test procedures established for selecting high-quality standard cells have been applied. The addition of Pb to Cd amalgam has the effect of reducing the temperature coefficient. The most appropriate composition of amalgam is that of 10 wt % Cd, 3-9 wt % Pb, and the balance Hg. The cells with Cd-Pb amalgam electrode have an EMF higher by about 1000 μV than that of normal Weston cell, and a temperature coefficient at 20° C or -17 μV/°C. The other characteristics and stability are the same as those of normal cells and they are suitable for high-precision work. Although zero temperature coefficient may be obtained by adding Pb and Bi to Cd amalgam, its characteristics are inferior to those of normal cells."
"A high-accuracy self-calibrating digital instrument design has been developed in order to make available the inherent efficiency advantages of conventional digital meters, but without their limitations in accuracy, reliability, or certifiability. The new instrument can extend the advantages of automation to many testing, quality control, and standards laboratories where heretofore only high-quality manually balanced instruments could be used. Automation at this level of accuracy can eliminate serious cost bottlenecks in the testing of precision devices such as Zeners, resistors, A/D and D/A networks and converters, standard cells, regulated power supplies, voltage and current sources, digital and differential voltmeters and potentiometers, and the dc output of many precision transducers. The paper describes a number of applications of this new type of digital instrument and presents samples of the type of automatic test data obtained."
"The purpose of this work is to establish a highly accurate automatic ratio measuring instrument for dc voltage and resistance. In voltage and resistance ratio measurements, accuracy of 0.1 ppm has now become necessary due to recent developments in quantum metrology. To obtain the accuracy, we have just developed a technique to automatically compensate the measuring error caused by the deviation of electrical components, such as resistances used in the instrument. The instrument described incorporates this technique. With internal reference voltage and resistance, it can be a precision voltohmmeter and also, it can be standardized to an external standard with an accuracy of 0.1 ppm."
"Measurements of the rms values of alternating currents are frequently made by means of thermal transfer instruments. At low and midfrequencies Thomson heating can have an important influence on the ac/dc transfer difference of these devices, whereas at higher frequencies the variation with frequency of the effective resistance of their heaters is the most decisive factor. The present paper examines the influence of both Thomson heating and the reactive components of the heater on the performance of the NPL multijunction convertor, and sets out the theoretical analysis that supports the claim that its ac/dc transfer difference does not exceed 1 or 2 ppm up to a frequency of 100 kHz."
"The design and performance of two high-accuracy transformers, identified as amplifier-aided two-stage transformers, are described. Each operates from 50 Hz to 10 kHz, supporting burdens up to 1 Ω. Self-contained ratios span from 5/5 to 100/5, with a rated secondary current of 5 A. Results indicate the errors at 10 kHz are within 30 and 15 ppm for the respective transformers, decreasing to less than 1 ppm at 1 kHz. Analysis of high-and low-frequency errors is presented, as well as a detailed description of a capacitance trimming technique effecting a factor-of-ten reduction of capacitive errors. Also described is a relatively simple step-up calibration system for determining the transformer errors. Calibration results are included."
"This paper describes a new method for direct-current measurement without direct connection to the circuit under test, producing a time-coded indication. A magnetizable ring core with three separate windings is driven to positive and negative saturation by a triangular alternating current. The voltage induced in the detector winding is differentiated. The time interval between two zero-axis crossings of the differentiated voltage is a measure of the current in the measuring winding. Investigations on an experimental setup showed that high resolution and sensitivity and small error of linearity can be achieved. Furthermore the internal resistance can be kept small."
"The principle of power measurement by thermal means has the advantage of a very large bandwidth and gives the possibility to realize time or frequency encoding in a simple way. The new method described is based on a known operation using special thermal converters with several heaters. The multiple heating, however, is done by a multiplexing operation on single-heater converters. It is shown that, by means of this principle, a power meter can be set up enabling precision measurement in a wide range of frequency. The measurement of real power in polyphase systems is another application of the same principle."
"The accuracy and frequency response limitations in the present square-law responding laboratory wattmeters have promoted the search for alternate methods of ac power measurement using electronic instrumentation. The three-voltmeter method is based on an old principle of operation implemented by new analog circuitry. Results of the tests reported here show a precision of power calculation with 0.01 percent error at frequencies below 5 kHz. A unique test procedure is described for the comparison of the three-voltmeter device and a time-division multiplier wattmeter operating at zero power factor."
"An analog system for the optical telemetry of voltage or current information using light-emitting diodes (LED) is described. Errors resulting from variations in the optical coupling efficiency are minimized because the light emitted by the LED contains the signal to be measured superimposed on a fixed intensity beam controlled by a reference zener diode. The nonlinearity of the LED is overcome by using part of its emitted light to control the feedback current to an operational amplifier that supplies the signal to the LED. The prototype system developed has a total error of approximately 0.2 percent of the input signal."
"The NPL calculable cross capacitor is designed to provide a standard of the highest accuracy. It has a vertical axis and the length is determined by central guard tubes. The length is altered by axial displacement of the lower tube and the change is measured interferometrically. This paper describes the construction and performance of the capacitor and records the results of the initial measurements; the uncertainty of these is of the order of 10-7."
"It has been found that under proper conditions thin dielectric films on the electrodes of certain types of cylindrical cross capacitors tend only to produce equal and opposite contributions to the phase angles of the two cross capacitances. To a lesser degree, this same type of cancellation effect has been found to be associated with toroidal cross capacitors."
"A theoretical investigation of the causes of error in multidecade two-staged inductive voltage dividers (IVD) has been made and from this an optimized design for the frequency band 10-400 Hz has been evaluated. A three-decade divider rated at 0.6 times frequency has been constructed and calibrated and the errors of voltage division do not exceed the design limits of 5 × 10-9 of input."
"A new method for an absolute measurement of voltage is given. It is based on the phenomenon that, when one electrode of a capacitor supplied with a constant voltage is moved, the amount of the change of the electrostatic energy stored in the capacitor is equal to the work required for this movement. A prototype of an apparatus to be used in this method was prepared and its performance has been examined. In an ideal case, it is considered possible to determine the voltage with an accuracy of a few parts in a million with this apparatus."
"The magnetic-field gradients produced by a current sequentially activating a few turns of wire of a precision solenoid are used to measure its pitch. The position of the activated portion of wire can be resolved to 0.1 μm. Preliminary results are found to be in agreement with an earlier measurement using a contacting probe to within the uncertainty of the latter determination. This new technique reduces many of the difficulties associated with conventional pitch measuring schemes and at the same time provides a method of obtaining increased accuracy."
"The automatic measuring system developed in the Electrotechnical Laboratory to monitor standard cells requiring a lot of measurements is described. It is composed of a scanner, an integrating-type digital voltmeter, a programmer or minicomputer, etc., and carries out the data acquisition and processing for a maximum of 200 cells. The difference in EMF of two cells is measured precisely. To reduce the effect of the induced EMF in the scanner, a delay unit is provided, and procedures minimizing errors and evaluating random errors have been adopted. In the on-line version of system, a great part of the data processing is done during the delay and integrating time of digital voltmeter. Applying this system to the measurement of standard cells, a precision of the order of 0.1 μV has been obtained."
"Saturated absorption techniques are being used increasingly often to measure optical resonances having such narrow bandwidths that they would otherwise be obscured by Doppler broadening. The principle underlying these techniques is reviewed using four simple thought or \"gedanken\" experiments. A rudimentary explanation is based on Bennett's \" hole-burning\" picture. Two configurations of typical saturated absorption experiments are described. One illustrates absorption outside and the other inside of a laser cavity. The intracavity technique is recommended for weak absorbers and when especially simple compact apparatus is needed. For most other experiments, the gaseous absorber is better located outside the laser cavity."
"The independent atomic time scale at the National Bureau of Standards AT(NBS), is based upon an ensemble of continuously operating cesium clocks calibrated occasionally by an NBS primary frequency standard. The data of frequency calibrations and interclock comparisons are statistically processed to provide nearly optimum time stability and frequency accuracy. The long-term random fluctuation of AT(NBS) due to nondeterministic perturbations is estimated to be a few parts in 1014, and the present accuracy is inferred to be 1 part in 1012. A small coordinate rate is added to the rate of AT(NBS) to generate UTC(NBS): this small addition is for the purpose of maintaining synchronization within a few microseconds of other international timing centers. UTC(NBS) is readily operationally available over a large part of the world via WWV, WWVH, WWVB, and telephone; also via some passive time transfer systems, eg., Loran-C and the TV line-10 system; and also experimentally via satellite and WWVL. The precision and accuracy of these dissemination systems will be discussed."
"Using an optically pumped atomic beam resonator a redetermination of the hyperfine structure separation of the ground state of 87Rb has been made. The zero-field value Δ𝒱0 = 6 834 682 612.8 ± 0.5 Hz agrees with previous determinations made with conventional atomic beams."
"The International Atomic Time (IAT) is a mean of local independent atomic time scales. The current procedure uses an algorithm ensuring the long-term stability, with fixed weights roughly proportional to the number of operating cesium standards. We found that the scale unit of IAT varied by probably less than 2 × 10-13 in relative value between January 1970 and December 1971. We tested some methods of weighting: they did not bring any substantial improvement. Our work suggests a more promising approach and also a means of maintaining both stability and accuracy."
"An automated data collection and processing system designed to maintain and control the U. S. Naval Observatory (USNO) master clock system is described. Phase difference and time interval measurements (better than 0.1-ns resolution and 1.0-ns precision) from an ensemble of atomic clocks are used to construct a master clock time scale with a stability of parts in 10-14 on a near real time basis. Physical realization and dissemination of the time scale is achieved through program-controlied subsystems. The control and automatic data processing (ADP) systems are discussed and an analysis of system performance is made."
"In this paper, the authors describe two automatic systems to analyze the performance of quartz oscillators and especially frequency standards. The first system is the I(τ) plotter used to the frequency stability measurement of oscillators in time domain. The second system draws the discrete spectrum of an oscillator. A computer coupled to the analyzer allows us to do a statistical analysis on the measurement."
"This paper describes the folded-ramp circuit, a computer-controlled device for measurements of time intervals from a few nanoseconds to a few seconds. The features of this circuit are single-range operation, binary-output format, measurement-error detection, and an output-register capacity that is set by dynamic range rather than accuracy or resolution. The circuit generates a ramp-type waveform that reverses slope at approximately 0 V and at a predetermined peak voltage; control of the ramp slope makes each leg of the folded ramp 100 ns in duration. The measured time interval is described by the number of slope reversals plus the amplitude difference between the voltage at termination of the measurement and at the last reversal. The circuit allows measurements of time over a 109 to 1 range with accuracies better than 1 percent of reading ±0.5 ns."
"The desired measurement accuracy; the relationships between field intensity, absorbed power, and hazards; and the usefulness of E and H field intensity measurements are discussed. Measurement accuracy versus the dimensions of the E-field antenna; measurement accuracy versus the capacitive coupling of the antenna with its surroundings; and measurement accuracy versus instrument calibration accuracy are all considered. A block diagram and the basic parameters of a universal measuring instrument now under development are included."
"Thin-film resistive screens operated in free space above a critical frequency fc are shown to exhibit constant cross sections over extremely broad frequency ranges. Below fc, the cross sections decrease approximately at the rate of 12 dB/octave. Electrical equivalents to the screen in the form of thin-film gratings or grids are used to generate directly an output voltage proportional to the absorbed radiation. Probes with physical cross sections of 1-in diameter and absorptivities of 15-20 percent can be designed to operate from below 200 MHz to well within the millimeter range."
"A probe using thin-film techniques to construct an array of extremely lossy dipoles makes possible an electromagnetic radiation monitor, having a 3-dB bandwidth from 300 MHz to 18 GHz, isotropic response, and independence of polarization. The measurement range is from 20 μW/cm2 to 20 mW/cm2."
"A time-domain (transient) method for (broad-band) measurement of the dielectric properties of biological substances is described. Theoretical analysis of the time dependence of the reflection coefficient following application of a step voltage to a shunt capacitor located at the end of a transmission line and filled with a very small amount of the dielectric showing the Debye dispersion is given. Analysis and calculations of the overall uncertainty of permittivity measurements as well as experimental results are presented and limitations of the method discussed."
"Laser power measurement instrumentation, the standards used, and the techniques are described. Average power can be measured with an accuracy approaching ± 1.2 percent using the international joule or electrical watt as the standard for calibration of the system. A determination of peak power can be made from the measurement of average power, repetition rate, and a knowledge of the power-time function. Automatic data acquisition and a time-share computer are used for data reduction."
"A calorimeter is described that can measure megajoules of laser energy from CW lasers whose output wavelength is in the region from 1 to 11 μm. The calibration of this device is traceable to NBS electrical standards. This calorimeter can measure total energies from 3 × 104 to 107 J. The laser power range this device can handle ranges from 300 to 100 000 W."
"A survey is given of current measurement activities at submillimeter wavelengths with particular regard to those carried out at the National Physical Laboratory. HCN and H20 lasers and Fourier transform spectrometry form the basis of the techniques. Outlines of their application to measurements of the absorption and refraction of solids and liquids, the emission of atmospheric gases and plasmas, and reflection from lossy materials such as semiconductors are given. Frequency and wavelength measurements and their application to a determination of the speed of light are also discussed."
"A new method of measuring admittances of microwave oscillators is proposed. In a usual method, changes of the output power of the oscillator and the oscillation frequency are measured by varying the admittance of a passive load. However, in a new method the variable passive load is replaced by an isolator and another oscillator (a signal generator) and even a positive admittance of the oscillator can be measured. A measurable range by this method is also discussed compared with that by the usual method."
"The precision rotary attenuator described in this paper has an 11-in-diameter optical grating attached to its rotor and the angle of the rotor is displayed to a resolution of 0.001° on a row of numerical indicator tubes, using techniques that were developed by Russell in 1966 at the National Engineering Laboratory in Scotland. According to measurements made at 10 GHz against the British National Standard, this rotary attenuator follows the 40 log10 (sec θ) law to within ± 0.0015 dB up to 16 dB. A small but important cyclic source of error has been discovered in the angular measuring system and the theory of it is presented. Two ways of reducing it are discussed."
"A waveguide method is described for improving the precision and accuracy of reflectivity loss measurements of perforated-plate mesh materials. Overall accuracies of the order of ±0.005 dB can be achieved through the use of a dual-channel tuned reflectometer system and high-precision insertion loss test set."
"The benefits resulting from the implementation of calibration systems based on the power equation concept are presented. Resulting uncertainties in the comparison of bolometer efficiencies are on the order of ±0.2 percent. Calibration costs have also been cut in half in respect to previous methods practiced at Autonetics. This method also shows significant cost advantages with respect to other methods described in the literature by Dentinger and de Pian. Both manual and automated bolometer calibration systems are described. Results of an experiment designed to illustrate the advantages of this concept using both type-N and SMA connectors are presented."
"A six-port coupler is described having four side arms whose outputs are proportional to the voltage, current, incident voltage wave, and reflected voltage wave at some desired measurement plane in the transmission line. The phase relationship between the outputs is the same as between corresponding quantities at the measurement plane. Complex impedance and phase angle as well as voltage, current, and power can be obtained from simple power or voltage magnitude measurements at the four side arms. A vector voltmeter used with this six-port becomes a direct reading vector impedance meter, admittance meter, or reflection coefficient meter."
"An analysis of an arbitrary 6-port junction, four ports of which are terminated by power meters, shows that the net power input (or output) at either of the remaining ports is a linear function of the four power meter indications. The validity of this result has been experimentally demonstrated at 10 GHz. This device promises to be a useful tool in a wide variety of power measurement and calibration problems."
"For measurement of RF pulse power, a 100 percent square-wave-modulated reference RF power is interlaced with the pulses. 100-ns-long samples are taken after detection from both the demodulated pulse and square wave. The level of the reference power is adjusted until both samples are equal. This method is independent of the temperature coefficient, law or stability of the detection efficiency. The method is compared with the notch wattmeter, crystal video-detector chopper, and sampling comparison using crystal switches."
"Two kinds of bolometer mounts have been recently developed at the Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL) that are suitable for the millimeter wave region, especially for the short millimeter waves. They are 1) a matched-load-type bolometer mount and 2) a rising-sun-type bolometer mount. The former is the mount for measuring the rectangular waveguide power and the latter is for the circular TE01 mode waveguide power. Experimental mounts of both kinds have been designed and examined at 100 GHz. These mounts have demonstrated superior performance compared to those commercially available."
"This paper outlines the work currently being carried out at the Royal Radar Establishment (RRE) in the RF and Microwave National Standards Division of the British Calibration Service, on both hot and cold noise standards and comparator systems. The design of three cryogenic noise sources for use in WG15 are described in detail along with the theoretical calculation of their output noise power spectral density. A noise-adding radiometer is analyzed, and finally the sources of uncertainty involved in a recent calibration are discussed."
"We present in this paper several methods that have been devised for the measurement of processes that take place in the picosecond range. Typical examples of radiative and radiationless processes are presented with an emphasis on the techniques rather than the analysis of the data, in accordance with the theme of this conference."
"The current status of time-domain metrology (TDM) in material and distributed network research is described. After a brief summary of earlier work, the operation and features of two prototype material measurement units are discussed. These semiautomated systems utilize a 5-V step recovery diode pulse generator and computer-controlled scanning procedures incorporating time-window stabilization and variable-dwell-time averaging. The larger, 10-ns time-window unit measures the complex permittivity and permeability over a frequency range of 0.1-10 GHz in about 10 min. The causes and magnitude of system errors are discussed along with continuing work to improve system performance. In distributed network research, the capabilities of TDM for calibration are being determined. From measured signal-to-noise ratios, it was calculated that random noise contributes less than 1 percent error for insertion loss measurements up to 50 dB over the frequency range 0.4-8 GHz. Other topics discussed include: identification and evaluation of error sources, pulse generator development, measurement configurations and procedures, and testing of waveguide and ferrite components."
"We show here that a wide class of nonlinearities in systems for measuring transients can be characterized as a delay that depends on the value and derivative of the signal being measured near the point at which it is being measured. Methods of measuring the delay as a function of these parameters are given."
"Kerr system electrical measurement techniques are improved by progress in two important areas: 1) in the development of methods for visualizing and measuring pulsed (microsecond) electric fields and high voltages from time-varying electrooptical fringe patterns recorded using high-speed photographic techniques, and 2) in the development of convenient experimental methods for evaluating and correcting path-dependent errors in Kerr system response. Results demonstrate use of fringe-pattern measurements in achieving accurate pulse voltage measurements and in correction of errors resulting from sizeable end-field variations in existing 300-kV Kerr cells."
"Baseband equalization techniques are applied to the problem of correcting the response characteristics of subnanosecond pulse transmission systems. In particular, we describe a system used in the equalization of high-quality coaxial transmission lines. The fundamental aspects of the system, the channel characterization, network design, and subsequent realization are discussed in detail. Some experimental results are also presented that demonstrate the applicability of the system."
"The time-domain error introduced by the planar skin-effect approximation is examined by comparing the approximate response with the cylindrical skin-effect response. Expressions are developed for the cylindrical skin-effect response and applied to line outer conductor ID sizes ranging from a 0.1-mm microminiature size to 10 mm. For 50-air dielectric lines (including 3.5 and 7 mm) curves are given for the cylindrical skin-effect response transition (rise) time (0 to 50 percent and 10 to 90 percent) versus line length (0.01-100 m). Step responses are given for a 1-m length of 0.1-mm 50-Ω microminiature line with relative dielectric constants of 1, 2, and 3."
"A new RF signal generator for the calibration of very high frequency omnidirectional radio (VOR) and instrument landing system (ILS) navigational receivers is presented. This new instrument improves the calibration accuracy of VOR angle and glide slope and localizer angle deviation by an order of magnitude over the calibration systems used up to now. The same order of magnitude improvement applies to the precision of AM level, phase angle settings, RF level, etc., and the stability of the simulated RF carrier in order to make the improved accuracy realizable. A new frequency lock technique allows to cover the RF frequency ranges continuously and still obtain a stability close to frequency synthesizer performance. The two major contributions to the improved performance are a linear and flat carrier amplitude demodulator using a two-diode voltage comparator and a new digital frequency lock technique. The carrier and modulation specifications are discussed which are necessary to achieve the improved accuracies. Measurement techniques are shown which are used to verify these accuracies along with the measurement results."
"Methods and results of verifying accuracy of computer-operated transmission measuring sets (COTMS) are discussed. These methods combine RF measurements made by the sets on selected networks with known properties with self-measurements made on the set on known system-error sources. The test methods may be applied to other automated transmission measuring systems and less completely to manual systems."
"Engen of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) has pointed out significant advantages in calibrating power sensors and attenuators in terms of efficiencies rather than scattering parameters. For example, efficiency measurements require the use of repeatable low-loss connectors, but do not demand carefully specified impedances. This offers hope of more accurate calibration of \"field-type\" components fitted with nonprecision connectors. Existing efficiency measuring procedures usually require tuned measuring networks to realize necessary conditions. This paper presents procedures that utilize complex signal ratio data (obtained, for example, from a network analyzer) taken from untuned microwave networks. Such procedures offer advantages in speed and convenience."
"A system is described that characterizes two-port RF networks from 0.4-500 MHz. Parameters measured are characteristic insertion loss, characteristic phase, and return loss, as well as group delay. Emphasis is placed on dynamic range specifications and the choices made in arriving at them. The factors controlling dynamic range are considered in detail with particular regard to those decisions that were made before hardware design began. An example is given demonstrating 115-dB range from maximum drive level to all noise and crosstalk."
"As part of a millimeter-wave development program at the National Bureau of Standards, a precision measurement method and system was devised to automatically measure the effective input noise temperature of 55-65-GHz receivers. Salient features of the system include a bolometric Y-factor measurement, a working \"hot\" noise source consisting of a waveguide argon gas tube mount developed at the National Bureau of Standards, and a minicomputer system controller operating in Basic. System design considerations and measurement uncertainties are discussed."

 "A story of my personal involvement in a rapid evolution of high-frequency electrical communication that began forty years ago and led to the merger of Kelvin's transmission-line theory, which had been the cornerstone of the telephone engineer's thinking, and more inclusive Maxwell's field theory is described. The early sections of this paper describe the state of electrical theories in those days, the environment in which I found myself, my previous interests and education, and the problems I was presented with; these are the four factors which determined the direction of my subsequent work. In the course of this work I found that, contrary to the then prevailing belief, Kelvin's transmission-line equations were consistent with Maxwell's field theory and the restrictive assumptions usually made in derivations of these equations are sufficient but not necessary. The major part of this paper presents a sketch of the gradual development of comprehensive wave-propagation equations which are applicable to a wide variety of guiding structures. These equations form also the basis of a comprehensive antenna theory. The concluding section describes briefly my mathematical theory of linear arrays which led to the discovery of superdirective arrays."
 "The objective of this paper is to evaluate from experimental data and observation five theoretical features of F. S. Keller's Personalized-Proctorial System of Instruction (PSI) for engineering education. This system was tested in courses in nuclear, mechanical, electrical, and operations research engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. We have found that students easily take advantage of the unique features of PSI and adapt them to their own needs, that they enjoy learning by this method, and that they learn more than in conventional courses. Our results indicate that the selfpacing and unit perfection features of PSI are extremely appropriate for engineering education; that the emphasis on written-word learning and the use of proctors are definite assets; and that the motivational lecture feature is of lesser value."
"Many opinions on teaching and teacher-student relations are published. In some of these pronouncements all changes and innovations in procedures, texts, and presentations are considered good. The following observations on a small segment of the overall teaching problem are offered, and results of one experiment presented, as still another input which-as many others-needs further study for verification."
"This paper presents an empirical demonstration of the efficiency with which an academic performance criterion (grade-point average) has been predicted in the past and notes the dearth of theory testing in educational research concerning such a criterion. The unimaginative and myopic nature of prior approaches is discussed and a comprehensive paradigm reflecting the complexity of academic behavior is presented."
"The Department of Engineering at Swarthmore began a new program in the summer of 1970 under which a team of undergraduates examines a major technological problem-complex, or \"superproblem.\" The superproblem first undertaken is entitled Electric Power for the Future. The program started as a summer study project; it is continuing as a project with academic credit during the school year. The program to date of writing is described and evaluated. It is expected that other superproblems (e.g. transportation, housing) will be offered in future years."
"This paper attempts to present more clearly the principles underlying the definition of a system of electrical units. First, it recalls briefly how fundamental and derived quantities are defined and how fundamental quantities are chosen. The main laws of electromagnetism are then written in a general form using the least number of arbitrary constants, namely three, compatible with the assumption that all the electrical units are derived in a consistent manner from the units of charge and current. It is shown how a system of units is selected and how this choice determines the values and dimensions of the three constants, two of which are just ϵo and μo. These considerations lead us to a discussion of the more or less fundamental nature of the four vectors describing the electromagnetic field and of the different ways in which these vectors can be associated."
"This paper describes four experiments using a nanosecond pulse generator and a sampling oscilloscope which are useful in an introductory microwave course."
"The design of an inexpensive CO2 laser and some associated laboratory projects are described. The laser is easily constructed by undergraduate students. The experiments are designed to familiarize students with some characteristics and applications of CO2 lasers."
"The details and philosophy of an interdisciplinary course that combines bioelectrical measurements and research preparation are described. This lecture-laboratory course is offered to students in bioengineering, electrical engineering, and biology in an attempt to provide some of the modern tools, techniques, and experiences necessary to perform quantitative experimental research. A systematic approach to research is used to guide the student to a final independent investigation of a problem of his choice. The combination of measurements and research experience of an interdisciplinary nature, for students with widely varying backgrounds, presents some rather unique advantages and difficulties that may be of interest to educators."
"An analogy is developed between a familiar electric network and the central limit theorem of probability theory. A laboratory experiment or demonstration which can enhance the students understanding of both problems is described. Finally, the digital filter analogy is discussed. It is shown that the experiment has both theoretical and practical value."
"A process is described for analog mapping of Poissonian fields which is well suited to the teaching laboratory. A capacitively coupled mapping system is employed in the form of a sandwich consisting of conducting silver paint, a thin tape as dielectric, and conducting paper. The technique allows the field from a single-source or from multiple-sources to be plotted. Field density information may be obtained directly from the map in the form of differential voltage measurements if desired. Some examples are included."
"Four packages of computer-graphics software developed specifically for teaching certain topics from nonlinear electronic circuits are described; namely, a package called ICAP for studying the signal processing properties of nonlinear circuits, a package called MECA for determining the driving-point- and transfer-characteristic plots of a large class of nonlinear electronic circuits, a package called GAMA for simulating the circuit models of three-terminal electronic devices, and a package called CAPPA for carrying out a phase plane analysis of second-order autonomous nonlinear systems. Several examples are presented to illustrate the application of each of these four computer graphics software packages."
"This paper discusses how the University of California at Santa Barbara on-line system can be used in the teaching of complex variables. This system, a descendant of the Culer-Fried system, with its speed and versatility gives the teacher as well as the student a rapid means of solution and visualization of answers. Several examples with figures are presented that demonstrate the role and effectiveness of this system as a teaching tool. Sample student laboratory exercises and report questions are given along with a few computer programs."

 "The Western Electric Corporate Education Center is a tangible manifestation of the company's long-term commitment to continuing education for its technical-professional, supervisory, and upper management employees. Educational programs which have evolved over a period of years now provide post-graduate schooling to accelerate the development of new employees, to maintain and expand the expertise of experienced employees, and to help supervisory employees cope with enlarged areas of responsibility. The three principal areas of study involved are engineering, computer science and information systems, and business management, with roughly equal emphasis in each of the three areas. Teaching load is shared about equally between experienced company employees, and local-area college faculty and specialized consultants. Some 5800 employees annually attend courses in modern, campuslike facilities which accommodate up to 300 resident students at a time."
"One of the country's most pressing problems is the need for continuing, advanced education-particularly technological education. To create the right atmosphere and to develop the proper employee motivation, IBM Education has an overall goal: to equip its employees to live with change; to anticipate it, to understand it, and then to implement it. Continuing education in industry protects the basic fund of knowledge and challenges the mind. More specifically, it assists in learning and understanding a new assignment and equips the individual for personal and professional growth. College graduation is not the ending; it is indeed the commencement-the point in time when an engineer's education really begins."
"The rationale for education in General Electric is its role in helping to assure the current and future adequacy of its professional and managerial work force. Education is an important mechanism for accelerating professional and managerial career development and is complementary to work assignments, supervision and coaching, and career planning. The paper describes these complementary relationships briefly and emphasizes in greater detail the process used to determine the array of educational activities offered to the professional and managerial workforce as well as the related educational methodology, facilities and basis for evaluation. These educational activities are designed to foster the expectation, desire, and habit of continuing education as an important adjunct to work experience in the process of lifelong self-renewal and personal growth."

"Lautum Officium Per Eruditionem-Service Through Education-is the mission of the Bell System Center for Technical Education (BSCTE). Established in 1968, BSCTE provides job-relevant technical training for Bell System Associated Company technical management personnel. Course development procedures are described. The practicality of those behaviorally based procedures is demonstrated by reference to the over fifty programs actively conducted by the school in three broad areas. 1. Transition training for the new hire. 2. Skill improvement. 3. Continuing technical education for middle management personnel."
"In a rapidly changing industrial world, ever more emphasis is placed on thorough and continuous intra-company education and training programs. In keeping with this dynamic development, the educational activities of Siemens Aktienge-sellschaft-a universal electrotechnical enterprise with general offices in Munich and 300 000 employees in more than 100 countries-have been replanned and fundamentally reorganized. General and staff-oriented knowledge is administered by central or corporate education departments; product or line-oriented knowledge is administered by decentralized or regional departments. Proposals for desired courses of study are solicited from both supervisory and non-supervisory personnel. Education centers in Erlangen and Munich and one management center are presently under construction or in the planning stages. Intra-plant educational activities are continually coordinated with publicly available education programs. The current investment in training of some 10,000 future employees amounts to 22-million dollars per year. 50 000 employees are currently enrolled in intra-company post-experience education programs, encompassing approximately 3-million enrollment hours and outlays of 18-million dollars per year."

"This paper examines one element of a total spectrum of education and training activities maintained by the Research and Engineering Division of the Xerox Corporation for updating and broadening its engineering and scientific personnel. It describes several ways in which one company capitalizes on its specialists and subject matter experts as instructional talent to share knowledge with other members of the technical community, and examines how cooperation between local colleges and universities during program development has resulted in relevant training to meet their specific industrial training needs. Techniques of using company resources to provide state of the art and interdisciplinary training in a wide range of highly unique and specialized areas are explored. Administrative and operational activities necessary for successfully establishing and maintaining an in-plant education and training program are examined, the scope of classroom facilities are specified, and the benefits achieved through these in-house training techniques are enumerated."
"Three major types of educational programs provided at General Motors Institute are described. Enumeration of thesis topics of some recent students indicates the various types of work assignments currently open to new Electrical Engineering graduates in industry. Resident and in-plant continuing engineering-education programs are discussed which are provided for maintenance, technician and engineering personnel. Some of the changes in emphasis occurring in electrical technology today due to developments in solid-state electronics are outlined."
"One of the important cost centers for an airline is flight crew training. Major commitments of capital and operating funds are necessary to qualify and maintain the proficiency of several thousand highly paid men. These men are responsible for aircraft that may cost in excess of $20 million per unit and which must be kept flying to produce revenue. Poor performance on the part of flight crews is reflected in the performance of the company. In addition to being the focal point of attention because of its expense, flight training also attracts attention for other reasons."
"A cooperative venture between the General Electric Company and the University of Pennsylvania, designed to generate an optimum mix of specialization and generalization in future engineering leaders, is described in this paper. Some historical background is presented to provide a framework for discussion of the objectives and operation of the program. This program is structured to combine industrial and academic experience to take advantage of the strengths of each, with a provision to award Advanced Course and Doctoral degrees. Program participants are young General Electric engineers and scientists who are deeply involved in exploring the solar system and applying space techniques and technologies to terrestial progress."

"Three new teaching techniques-programmed instruction, Fields technique, and the Keller proctorial system were integrated and used in the teaching of an introductory Fortran programming course at the University of Washington Spring Quarter 1971. Programmed instruction was first used in 1967, then Fields-type teaching questions were included in 1969, and the Keller technique was integrated with the other two in 1971. Achievement, based on 90%or better for each unit, has been increased, grades earned were higher, and most students like the technique better than conventional teaching, although some students feel it is more work. Student proctors gave assistance as needed on a one-to-one basis and did the administering and grading of achievement quizzes. The writer believes students learn more with this technique, and about $1150 can be saved each quarter using the integrated system with 100 students and ten paid proctors."
"A proposal is advanced to modify the present form of university instruction via lectures and examinations. The proposal combines some of the recent innovations in teaching methods to create a student-oriented process of information transmission and feedback."
"This paper reports the development, operation, and initial performance evaluations of an EE laboratory station equipped for Computer-Guided Experimentation. Evaluation of two programmed lessons is also included in this paper. The laboratory station equipped for Computer-Guided Experimentation will automatically feedback information reporting a student's laboratory activities (namely, the interconnections he makes between the terminals of his experimentation equipment and his settings of instrument dials) to a time-shared computer-aided instructional system, so that the student can be guided automatically through a lesson in any manner preprogrammed by an instructor. It is contemplated that these facilities will be expanded to a number of laboratory stations when more CAI stations become available as a result of future expansions in the PLATO computer-based educational facilities at Urbana."
"A powerful method for learning basic engineering principles involves the study of a set of specially defined \"cases.\" The method has attractive motivational aspects since it immediately involves the student in applications. This technique is well suited for energy (\"power\") engineering education; a list of suitable subjects is presented, and four of these are expanded as an example of a set of projects for a semester course."
"A non-compulsory course in communication systems on the graduate level is presented. It is organized as a case study of a technical system design problem with a different subject in successive years. The main aim of the course is to let the students apply their theoretical knowledge from previous courses to a well defined problem of practical significance. The approach used is intended to give insight into the way development work is done in an industrial laboratory. The prerequisites and objectives of the course are stated, followed by a description of its organization. As an example one subject offered in 1970 is presented, dealing with Pulse-Code-Modulation over pair cables. Some observations from the course are given, together with the results from an evaluation of the student response."
"Engineering educators are developing an increasing concern for the quality of instruction in their schools. Imaginative solutions to educational problems, together with innovative hardware techniques are reported with increasing frequency in the literature. However, in order to be truly effective, engineering education for the future must adopt a more radical departure from traditional methods. Real support for teaching excellence begins in graduate schools, where training for the professorial is initiated. Until educators begin assigning priority to the development of training procedures in engineering education, the quality of instruction can not be expected to improve significantly."
"Project Colorado CO-TIE was initiated in 1968 to help college students in their transfer from two-year pre-engineering programs to four-year degree-granting universities. The main feature of CO-TIE is that videotapes of key sophomorelevel courses (predominantly Network Analysis) are provided to the participating colleges. Experience with CO-TIE has shown that colleges, in general, are inadequately equipped to provide undergraduate students with the laboratory and computer facilities needed in a modern, sophomore-level Network Analysis sequence. Recent university and college cooperation has been successful in the design and acquisition of both a sophomore-level Network Analysis laboratory for each of the participants, and a statewide computer facility."
"Two Master's level student projects are described stressing the on-line real time use of a minicomputer as an element of an overall system. Emphasis is placed on using the dedicated minicomputer as an integral part of the system being developed and as a systems tool rather than as a simulator. The specific aspects of the dedicated minicomputer which makes it well suited for engineering applications and for use in student projects as well as the educational benefits derived from this type of individual projects are discussed. Two projects in communications [1] and controls [2] are described in detail including their results, conclusions and overall student reaction."
"The large-screen oscilloscope here described is characterized by versatility and convenience of operation. Colored pictures are particularly suited for demonstration experiments. In a first part the paper discusses the general requirements to be met by such a system and a few typical applications. An ordinary color picture tube as designed for television type scanning deflection is used. To present multicolor-multichannel pictures by a fixed frequency scanning system would, however, involve very complex circuity. Thus an x-y-deflection system customary with ordinary oscilloscopes is employed. This provides, incidentally, a better contrast. In a second part of the article deflection and convergence units of the system are discussed."
"A remote terminal for a hybrid computing system which is fully compatible with both the analog and digital computer subsystems and which can be built at a low cost has been designed. The operation and application of this new terminal system is described with emphasis placed on its flexibility and low cost. A storage oscilloscope is connected to the remote terminals as an output display unit. The total system is operating and has proven to be highly desirable as an educational tool."
"A course in electrical engineering for freshmen, suitable for both engineering and non-engineering students, is presented. The course is intended to give the students an overall view of the field, at the same time teaching them enough fundamentals that they will be able to diagnose and develop simple circuits, getting a taste of design. A hydraulic analog is presented for ease and speed in teaching basic electrical concepts. An unconventional teaching technique, the \"inclassdrill,\" is used, with encouraging results."
"The development of a new electrical machines laboratory is discussed in this paper. The objectives and the underlying philosophy for achieving a physical understanding of machines are stated. The equipment developed and some typical experiments are described."
"A senior-level laboratory experiment on semiconductor bulk-effect oscillators is described. The experiment is shown to be simple and inexpensive while providing a satisfactory introduction to bulk-differential-negative-resistance and transit-time phenomena."
"An integrated undergraduate course dealing with the basic principles of laboratory practices, including instrumentation, measurements, modeling, simulation and design is described. The dual role of the computer for automated data reduction and simulating experiments is emphasized. Under the supervision of a faculty member, the student is guided from a dependent state to the project design stage."

 "Approximately 50 Colleges of Advanced Education have been established in Australia since 1966, of which about 20 have engineering schools. The colleges were created as a direct result of a Federal Government committee's investigation into higher education. The committee recommended the development of more industrially oriented educational institutions as alternatives to the existing research oriented universities. This paper details some of the more important steps leading to the creation of the colleges. It describes how the aims for more industry integrated education are being achieved in the undergraduate electrical power engineering courses at The Capricomia Institute of Advanced Education, one of the smallest and most isolated of the new colleges."
"The paper describes how the Industrial Training Act, enacted to raise the quality and quantity of training in the U. K., is implemented, and outlines some training recommendations of the Engineering Industry Training Board which affect personnel in the electrical and electronic industries, and their impact on education. The two industries encountered considerable practical difficulties in the operation of the Act, and these are explained. The author outlines recent proposals by the Minister of Employment on the future of training in the U.K., which suggest a new training pattern, and industry's reaction to them."

"This paper discusses the engineering education philosophy in Central America today. To provide the proper background it begins by explaining the educational system of the area and by analyzing the influence that civil engineering has had on engineering education. Finally, it attempts to look into the future to see how engineering education may change."
"One consequence of the remarkable growth rate in the Mexican economy over the past two decades has been an equally remarkable engineering student population explosion, particularly during the decade of the 1960's. The present situation is, however, paradoxical in that the considerable improvement in educational opportunity and participation may well be out-pacing the growth rate which the economy can healthily maintain. This paper discusses the implications of this paradox on future trends and needed controls in educational development. Undergraduate and graduate engineering education, faculty, administration, and the status of engineering research in Mexico are described and discussed."
"Electrical engineering education in the U.S. is described for comparison with other educational systems discussed in this issue on international education. Some of the changes that have taken place since World War II are given, including enrollments, popularity of fields in terms of student choice and employment opportunities, reduction in the structure of the curriculum, and differing views on the time required to reach the first engineering degree. Finally, some guidelines are offered for the future development of education for electrical engineering in the U. S."

   "Tritium is produced naturally and was present in low concentrations in precipitation and natural bodies of water before atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons. Other sources of tritium are now present from which tritium is released to the environment. Nuclear reactor tritium production, according to recent estimates, will equal natural tritium production before the year 2000. Predicted increases of tritium in the environment will take place first on a local ecological level and then appear on a biospheric level. Tritium introduced into the environment as THO will move through ecological systems in the same manner as stable water. Tritium will enter the hydrologic cycle either via evapo-transpiration or the surface bodies of water. Ecological experiments have been conducted to determine the movement of tritium in the environment. Field-grown plants were exposed to liquid and vapor THO for periods of one-half and one hours. Tritium concentrations were determined in leaf samples collected after exposure for periods of time up to 45 days. Tritium decays rapidly in the plant species studied and exhibited a three component half-life when plants were exposed to THO vapor. The length of exposure, and sources of THO in the soil affect the half-time of tritium in the plant tissues. Data produced in ecological experiments on tritium movement are used in a theoretical consideration of acute and chronic vapor releases of tritium in an agricultural environment."
"This paper considers the optimal design and implementation of two-dimensional, nonrecursive digital filters for use in the processing of radiographic images. A stochastic system model is used for the image-forming process, and the filter is designed to a mean-square error criterion. Both the design algorithm and filter realization are mechanized by using a Fast Fourier Transform code, thereby ensuring the computational efficiency of the method."
"We describe a camera for the laminographic imaging of the thyroid without administration of radiopharmaceuticals to the patient. An external source of gamma-rays is used to excite the characteristic x-rays of natural iodine in the patient's thyroid, source geometry limiting excitation to well-defined planes. The camera consists of a parallel hole collimator and a xenon-filled proportional wire chamber with digitized readout of coordinates. Pulse height selection is provided to limit events in the image display to a selected energy range. We estimate that the system will obtain high resolution laminography for local exposures on the order of 1 to 5 rad, with exposure times of a few minutes for each laminogram."
 "Arrays of silicon avalanche detectors are being used for Ti vivo detection and measurement of low energy radiation in very small activities at room and body temperatures. Plutonium may be measured (via the 13.5-20 keV daughter uranium L x-rays) with an array of three 1 cm2 avalanche detectors in the esophagus, examining the thoracic lymph nodes which accumulate inhaled PuO2. The three detectors used in this array together provide uniformity of sensitivity to a source at any angle around the longitudinal axis of the array; using three independent signal processing systems, the array can also provide localization information. Plutonium scratches and puncture wounds may be inspected for contamination and the plutonium may be localized using a specially fabricated 1/8 inch diameter avalanche detector. With this configuration, the Minimum Detectable Amount (MDA) of Plutonium-238 (84% confidence level and four minute count) measured through 2 mm of tissue is 1 nCi. Early results of improved uniformity and resolution with the avalanche detector have shown promise of increased efficiency per unit area of detector face. A step toward unambiguous detection by making better use of the nanosecond speed of avalanche is described."
"The importance of characterizing aerosol properties in evaluating the behavior and potential hazards of radioactive aerosols is emphasized. The instruments and techniques for studying the properties of radioactive aerosols including special properties such as chemical form, solubility, and state of electrostatic charge are discussed. The uses of electrostatic and thermal precipitators for electron-microscopic observations and measurements, and of various aerodynamic samplers such as impactors, centripeters, cyclones, and aerosol centrifuges for study of size distribution, particle density and shape factors, and relative specific activity are reviewed. The conventional terminology for describing particle size and size distributions is described with emphasis on the relationships to the factors associated with the potential hazards of inhaling radioactive aerosols."
"A specially designed scintillation probe has been assembled and applied in a promising diagnostic study of malignant melanoma in the human eye. When used in conjunction with a new radiopharmaceutical agent recently developed at The University of Michigan, 125I labeled chloroquine analog, the probe permits simple and nonsurgical gamma ray counting as a substitute for more elaborate techniques required in 32p beta scanning for the same prupose. Preferential uptake of the agent in ocular melanomas has been previously reported using a modified 5-inch NaI (Tl) crystal scanner as the detector. We have realized a substantial improvement in both sensitivity and reproducibility by substituting a hand-held probe placed in contact with the patient's closed eyelid. The counting rate over each eye is followed for a period ranging from 3 to 21 days after dosage. A melanoma in one eye gives rise to an enhanced rate over that eye. Data are presented on a total of 12 patients, including two with confirmed ocular melanomas. In both of these cases, the involved eye consistently shows a significantly greater activity than the opposite eye. In the remaining cases considered \"negative\", measured eye-to-eye asymmtries are much lower, and a measure of the variance associated with these cases is presented."
"It is shown experimentally that a new x-ray phosphor Gb2O2S: Tb used as an intensifying screen with the common blue-sensitive x-ray photographic film can increase sensitivity to medical x rays by about a factor of 2 relative to CaWO4 which is currently used. It is also shown that a sensitivity increase of about 20 is possible if photographic film is optimized to the Gd2O2S: Tb emission."
"To the relatively few groups actively engaged in automated chromosome studies, the title of this paper is rather self explanatory because it proposes to address a problem which has become apparent to all of us who have sought to automate cell analysis. The need for human interaction implies that our automated procedures are not error free and require some degree of human verification and correction within the procedure. Indeed this is so. The fact that a problem exists may be attributed to an over-optimistic concept of the capability of machines to duplicate apparently simple human activity. It follows that certainly one purpose of this paper would be to discuss the need for human interaction in automated chromosome analysis and to suggest an approach to the question of where and how interaction should be implemented. However, so that others who may be unfamiliar with automated chromosome analysis can achieve a better understanding, the format of this paper includes a brief overview of human cytogenetics along with an attempt to treat the significance of chromosome abnormalities in terms of the need for population studies. Unfortunately, the justification for automated procedures in cytogenetics has been based upon the need to reduce the labor and tedium involved in large studies without the need for the large studies themselves being clearly established on a cytogenetic basis."
"Examples of radiation damage in lithium-drifted detectors, lithium-drifted silicon detectors, and high-purity germanium detectors are discussed. The general patterns of damage, lithium-precipitation, annealing and recovery of detectors are outlined, and the observations are discussed."
 "At present, as in the past, the bulk of environmental radiation comes from natural sources, cosmic radiation, and natural radioactivity. The normal dose to man from natural sources ranges from about 60 to 250 mrads/year. Fallout from weapons testing has provided as much as 20 to 25 mrads/year during the early to mid-1960's. At present, medical uses provide 20 to 100 mrads/year to the average individual in the U.S. Radiation to the general population from nuclear power is insignificant at present. With the trend toward improved technology in the control and containment of radioactivity from nuclear facilities, future levels should not exceed those observed from fallout. Improvements in radiological procedures should materially reduce unnecessary exposure from this application."
"Analysis of biological and environmental samples differs from other physics applications in the need for very high sensitivity. A number of factors, including efficiency, geometry, resolution, and an interrelation of these, all affect sensitivity. An analysis, based on both experimental data and computations, indicates that in the range of equal detector volumes < 40 cm3, planar detectors are to be preferred over coaxial detectors due to their much better ability to quantitate data at energies below 500 keV without loss of performance at higher energies. For equal detector volumes in excess of 40 cm3, coaxial detectors may be preferred for high energy use due to their better resolution, but performance at lower energies will still favor the planar detectors."
 "The radioactive isotopes of the rare gases provide unique geophysical and mete-orological information concerning the properties and history of our (atmospheric) environment. The extremely low activity levels, however, require very special methods of measurement, experiment design, and data interpretation. Following an examination of the decay characteristics and atmospheric abundances of Kr and Ar radioisotopes, the question of experiment planning and data interpretation in the \"extreme Poisson\" (few counts) region is considered. A reduced activity plot is offered as an aid for making rapid evaluations and decisions in this region. The concept of an effectively zero background is illustrated by means of atmospheric 37Ar data. Finally, the problem of the blank is examined, and the merits and deficiencies of three alternative approaches are discussed, again with special emphasis on the measurement of 37Ar in Nature."
"The low level counting capabilities and critical parameters of Ge(Li) gamma ray spectrometers are investigated using an expression for the spectrometer sensitivity limit. The significance of the counting parameters involved and the practical means by which they may be optimised have also been considered. A comparison method is used to evaluate the effectiveness and behaviour of several available counting techniques (e.g. coincidence and anti-coincidence methods)."
"An experimental study has been performed to investigate the ultimate limit of the intrinsic background of a Ge(Li) detector. The results obtained in three runs under different experimental conditions are compared and discussed. A tentative interpretation of the various sources of background and of their relative contribution is given. From the measurements performed in an underground laboratory with an attenuation factor for cosmic rays of 106, the ultimate background level appears almost completely due to radioactivity present in the structural materials of the cryostat and shield. An important contribution is attributable to airborne radioactivity due to 222Rn daughters."
"A high efficiency Ge(Li) detector system with a NaI(Tl) annulus and \"back-detector\" has been developed to provide coincident and anti-coincident gamma-ray spectrometry of low level samples. Independent control of the three detector signals and a flexible logic arrangement allow optimum detection of non-coincident (Compton suppression) or coincident gamma-rays with either wide or narrow angles of correlation. This counting system and its application to the analysis of environmental samples is described."
"The environmental level gamma energy system developed at Atlantic Richfield Hanford Company laboratories consists of a single, large volume Ge(Li) detector with an NaI(Tl) anticoincidence guard, all operating in a laminar flow \"Clean Room.\" A peak height to Compton edge ratio of better than 250:1, together with a reducing background, enables analysis of sample volumes from point sources to 700 cc."
"An evaluation of a low level, high resolution anticoincidence shielded Ge(Li) spectrometer, constructed over five years ago, has been made. The evaluation was based upon results obtained in assaying a variety of biological and environmental samples, each contained in a 200 cm3 aluminum can. The spectrometer used an 18 cm3 planar type Ge(Li) detector constructed in our Laboratory. An example of the very high sensitivity possible with the spectrometer was in the assaying for 137Cs in a 296 gram soil sample which was determined to have a concentration of 0.027 pCi of 137Cs per gram of soil. Description of the spectrometer, methods used in data analysis and results of counting low level samples are given."
  "A method for disposing of nuclear-reactor wastes by in-situ incorporation in molten silicate rock is presented. In this method, liquid wastes are injected into a deep underground chimney and allowed to self-boil. The resulting steam is processed at the ground surface and recycled into a closed system. When waste addition is terminated, the chimney is allowed to boil dry, thereby solidifying the waste. The heat generated by the radioactive waste then melts the surrounding rock, which dissolves the waste. Finally, the rock refreezes, trapping the radioactivity in an insoluble rock matrix deep underground. This method has significant environmental and economic advantages over previously proposed methods."
"Routine sampling techniques are acceptable for environmental tritium, although attention must be paid to the chemical and physical state of the tritium. Liquid scintillation and gas counting techniques are both acceptable for counting tritium, with gas counting being the most sensitive. Sensitivities for tritium can be increased greatly by electrolytic enrichment before counting."
 "The counting of low energy gamma-rays from mercury in activated environmental and biological samples is often hindered by dominant activity of higher energy gamma-rays from elements such as sodium. An investigation of gamma-ray interaction theory for silicon and germanium at these energies shows that germanium is the preferred material, and that a detector thickness of about 5 mm in the direction of the incident gamma-ray is optimum for mercury counting. Measurements and Figure-of-Merit calculations for true coaxial, closed-end coaxial, and thin high resolution planar Ge(Li) detectors resulted in FOM values for this application of 2.5 to 4.6 for the large volume coaxial detectors, and 8.0 to 17.3 for the thin planar detectors. Coincidence counting of the gamma- and x-rays can yield large FOM values and separation of the gamma- and x-rays in the recorded spectrum. Certain phenomena related to coincident emission, to background efficiency, and to energy resolution are not included in the FOM, and should be considered separately in defining optimum detectors."
"A charged particle activation technique has been developed to analyze for trace impurities in the ppm range or less in water. Water samples are evaporated onto a tantalum foil and activated in a 15 MeV proton beam in the present work. The gamma ray spectrum from the activated sample is analyzed to quantitatively determine simultaneously trace amounts of boron, bromine, sodium, cadmium, chromium, selenium, and nitrogen. Total irradiation and counting time is less than two minutes. Beam currents are ≲ 1 μa."
 "A description of a portable Ge(Li) field spectrometer and its application to in situ measurements is given. The mathematical techniques of calibrating the spectrometer so that field spectrometer counting rates may be converted into units of soil activity are developed. The quantification of gamma-ray emitting radionuclides in the field has proven to be more sensitive than laboratory analysis using Ge(Li) anticoincidence shielded spectrometers. This was demonstrated by obtaining approximately the equivalent statistical accuracies for quantifying several radionuclides from a 30 min field count as compared to a 1437 min laboratory analysis. A comparison between the results obtained from field analysis with those obtained by returning the samples to the laboratory are given for natural radionuclides and 137Cs. An example of qualitative spectral data obtained from field measurements of gaseous emissions from a BWR reactor is also given."
"A system designed to perform quantitative assay of plutonium waste material in 30 to 55 gallon barrels is described. The system uses up to eight 2 in. × 2 in. NaI(Tl) detectors to make a detailed gamma ray scan of the barrel to be assayed. Barrels of 55 gallon size containing 239Pu waste and 30 gallon barrels containing 238Pu waste (from 238PuO2 isotopic heat source production) have been scanned with this system. Experience has shown that a barrel assay can be performed in 10 to 15 minutes to an accuracy of ±10%. The sensitivity of the system is one gram or better for 239Pu or 238Pu in low to medium density waste material."
 "A low power x-ray powder diffraction system suitable for remote mineralogical analysis of lunar, planetary, or asteroid soils has been designed. A one Curie 55Fe source provides a monochromatic x-ray beam of 5.9 keV. Seeman-Bohlin or focusing geometry is employed in the camera, allowing peak detection to proceed simultaneously at all angles and obviating the need for moving parts. The detector system is an array of 500-600 proportional counters with a wire-spacing of 1 mm. An electronics unit comprising preamplifier, postamplifier, window discriminators and storage flip-flops requiring only 3.5 milliwatts has been designed and tested. Total instrument power is less than 5 watts. Powder diffraction patterns using a flat breadboard multiwire counter have been recorded."
"This paper points out the importance of studying case histories in courses of instruction on nuclear instrumentation, and that the byproducts of such studies can often provide useful research projects. The case of the gamma backscatter density gauge is considered as a specific example. Starting from the original type of gauge, using a fixed source-detector separation in which a counting rate vs density chart is employed, the authors discuss the elimination of \"soil type\" effects, the anomalous behaviour of hydrogen, etc. to the new moving-source (variable source-detector distance) gauge, and the advantages which it offers, e.g. no calibration being necessary, etc. Finally, more recent work is described showing how the density gauge may be employed for measuring the moisture content of materials as well as the density."
    "A critical examination of observations on high-purity germanium exhibiting acceptor concentrations in the 1010/cm3 range, indicates that the acceptors are probably due to lattice defects such as vacancy clusters. The paper presents evidence to support this contention."
"The availability of germanium with less than 1010 acceptors/cm3 has enabled us to fabricate and study the performance of germanium detectors of substantially larger volume than has hitherto been possible except by using lithium-drifting techniques. Detectors having a sensitive volume of up to 25 cm3 have been made. These detectors have a lithium diffused n+ contact and a metal barrier non-injecting back contact, and are totally depleted. The energy resolution of these detectors is similar to that of equivalent sized lithium-drifted detectors, but the high-purity detectors are easier to fabricate, and present considerably fewer handling problems."
"γ-ray spectrometers prepared from high purity germanium have been studied at low temperature down to 5° K. If sufficient bias voltage was applied the same energy resolution at 5°K than at 77°K was found. At lower bias voltage, below 10°K, the resolution deteriorated rapidly due to the appearance of a slow rising component (up to several microseconds) in the pulses. This behaviour seems to be related to the effect on the signal of the resistance and capacitance of the undepleted region -the resistivity becoming significant at low temperature due to carrier freeze-out on the primary shallow donors-rather than to the effectγ of carrier trapping by shallow level impurities."
"It is shown, theoretically and experimentally, that PCD lifetime measurements, as a function of temperature in p-Ge, may be used to determine the concentration, the trap energy and capture cross sections for electrons, of single and multilevel impurities."
"We have attempted to measure the level of deep electron trapping centres in Ge(Li) detectors by observing the variation of pulse amplitude with temperature over a wide temperature range. The mean time TD for the re-emission of a trapped carrier from a given level decreases exponentially with increasing temperature; as TD becomes shorter than the amplifier time constants, pulse amplitude should show an increase over a narrow temperature interval. No such transition was observed between 80 and 160 K. We conclude that the main electron trap is deeper than 0.175 eV."
"The process of γ-compensation as a method for fabricating Ge radiation detectors has been studied in some detail. Particular attention has been focused on the energy distribution and concentration of the levels created by the γ-irradiation, on the differences between crystals before and after irradiation, on the field configurations in junctions with deep traps, and on obtaining the carrier trapping cross-sections due to irradiation. It is found that crystals with impurity concentrations of 5 × 1010 to 5 × 1012 (cm)-3 can be quite different from each other before and after irradiation. Compensation of n-type material to a very low n or p-type residual conductance is always feasible, although the compensation mechanism for devices at near thermal equilibrium is different from that of diodes with bias applied. From measurements with several compensated detectors, it is found that effective hole trapping cross-sections of 10-12 to 10-13 cm2 are commonly obtained, resulting in poor resolution even with initial materials of the highest purity. One exceptional crystal gave excellent resolution after compensation but suffered catastrophic failure with a small amount of over-irradiation. This particular result has helped to propose a two threshold mechanism, which, in combination with the knowledge gained from the calculation of field distributions in junctions with deep levels, may explain the results observed. Emphasis is then placed on the apparent need for extreme crystal uniformity, which, if confirmed, will result in declaring the γ-compensation process impractical for the fabrication of radiation detectors."
"Recent developments in germanium are presented. Existing theories about trapping in Ge,(Li) detectors are criticized. Major improvements in quality have been achieved. Chemical impurities, as a possible source of electrontrapping, are discussed."
"Lithium mobility and precipitation were correlated with other electrical and IR-optical measurements on dislocation free crystals grown under special conditions in order to avoid vacancy clustering. It is shown that the classical expression of Pell, to derive the oxygen content, is no longer applicable to those crystals. The influence of annealing on the Li diffusion constant shows that vacancy supersaturation poisons these crystals or that the role of the different oxygen-configurations has to be reviewed."
"The temperature dependence of the lifetime in silver doped p-Ge, as measured by the PCD method, is shown to be in agreement with a model for recombination through multivalent flaws. New values of capture cross section are determined (σ o/n = 1.5×10-14 cm2, σn- = 0.75×10-16 cm2). Lifetimes of electrons and holes are also measured on a silver doped Ge(Li) detector, by means of two techniques, using a collimated beam of ∂-rays (137Cs). Silver causes preferential hole tarpping and therefore cannot be responsible for the preferential electron trapping usually observed."
"In germanium, Te is a double donor. Te, when capturing one electron, is still repulsive for holes, and has no influence on the recombination lifetime of electrons in p-type Ge. In accordance with what one should expect, measurements with collimated beams of 4326528-rays, show that Te is a preferential electron trap."
"An infrared response technique has been developed wnich has been shown to yield more detailed spectra than previous techniques and which can be used to identify more specifically energy levels arising from unwanted impurities and defects in semiconductor diodes used as nuclear radiation detectors. The presence of known impurities in germanium detectors, both lithium-compensated and high purity (uncompensated), has been confirmed using this technique. Such impurities include copper, gold, and iron. Features in the spectra associated with crystalline defects have also been identified."
"Electronic noise is the ultimate resolution limiting factor in non-dispersive low energy X-ray spectrometers. Lossy dielectric materials in the input of the spectrometer's charge-sensitive preamplifier contribute significant amounts of noise. In particular, the glass insulating header of the input JFET produces a major portion of this dielectric noise. A previous small experimental lot of JFETs encapsulated with low loss ceramic headers exhibited significantly lower electronic noise than JFETs with lossy glass headers containing the same type JFET chip. A larger lot of JFETs (~350) encapsulated with 99% BeO ceramic headers has been prepared under standard transistor production conditions. Processing details are reported as well as statistical analyses of noise and other electrical measurements obtained on a random sample from this production lot. Similar data are reported for commercial JFETs containing the same type chip (TI-2N4416) encapsulated in an epoxy body and encapsulated with glass headers. In addition, measurements have been obtained for JFET chips mounted on high purity Al2O3 (99.5%) thin flat substrates. These substrates, normally used for integrated circuit production, exhibit very low loss at high frequencies. Previous results are confirmed in that JFET chips encapsulated with ceramic headers (under production conditions) produce significantly lower noise than epoxy or glass encapsulated JFETs. For a 2-μsec main amplifier Gaussian shaping time, the high purity A12O3; flat substrates produce less noise than the BeO headers. For 5-μsec shaping, no significant difference is observed between the two ceramic materials."
"Metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices have been used for detecting low-energy (2 to 20 keV) x rays for incident fluences of 10-4 to 10-1 cal/cm2 (or dosage in the device of 103 to 106 rads) in a bent-crystal spectrometer application. An attractive feature of the detector is that the three functions of 1) detection, 2) memory, and 3) readout are integrated into one semiconductor chip."
"Fast photomultipliers operating in the single-photoelectron limit exhibit a bimodal time distribution of output pulses; typically, 0.01 of output pulses occur several nanoseconds later than the most probable time. Correlation techniques can be used to characterize photomultiplier time response, and results are given for some commonly used tubes. Late pulse probability is a function of some tube parameters, but even when it is minimized, the effects of late pulses are significant in uses of single-photon counting such as the study of macromolecule fluorescence decay."
"This paper describes a sub-nanosecond response time photomultiplier tube, which uses a chevron microchannel plate for electron multiplication. Fabrication of the device is described, stressing the advantages of using a microchannel plate multiplier. Measurements of the tube performance are given."
"A universal energy transfer function is derived that applies to absorption of X-rays or gamma rays in all thin luminescent screens over a wide range of incident energies. This function is evaluated for monoenergetic incident radiation and for bremsstrahlung originating in gold targets. A scaled universal luminescence yield is given, in terms of the energy transfer function minus an energy escape function which accounts for the energy loss by electron escape from the phosphor. Under conditions where the energy escape is small, the dominant dependence of the luminescence yield on the phosphor appears only as a multiplicative material characteristic constant."
"A prototype position-sensitive proportional counter was investigated for use in neutron imaging applications. The counter uses a converter foil of 6LiF and a collimation grid to achieve improved resolution compared to counters filled with a neutron-sensitive counting gas. The proportional counter consists of a grid of 36 1-mil pyrolytic carbon coated quartz fibers on 2.5 mm centers. Because of the high resistance of the collector wires and the distributed capacitance to ground, the rise time of a pulse will increase with distance along the collector. This rise-time information is used to determine the position of an event to accuracies less than 1 mm along the wire. Standard nuclear instrumentation techniques are utilized with readout on a multichannel pulse height analyzer or on a storage scope. Tests performed with alpha particles showed that a geometry using collector wires off center by 0.5 mm produced the best resolution. The best resolution achieved was 0.59 mm FWHM, but the off-center geometry was not used for the neutron imaging experiments because of difficulties in achieving stable operation. Neutron images produced by this counter had an unsharpness of 5.5 mm (3.3 mm FWHM) and a contrast of 55%; this was wijh a 6LiF converter foil (100μ). Images with 10B and Gd converter foils showed unsatisfactory contrasts."
"A proportional chamber employing delay-line readout has been adapted for thermal-neutron imaging through the use of a boron converter plate as one of the chamber electrodes. A small prototype chamber using natural B for a converter has achieved 0.5% thermal-neutron-detection efficiency and better than 2 mm resolution (10% - 90% knifeedge). A converter-plate-model calculation gives good agreement with the measurements and shows how efficiency and resolution vary with chamber thickness, energy discrimination, and B and Alovercoating thicknesses. Substitution of 10B for the natural B would give a five-fold increase in efficiency and the calculations indicate that a further improvement in both efficiency and resolution of up to 50% is achievable in a single-plate system. The results of these calculations and a comparison with measurements are presented."
"Self-powered detectors are potentially valuable in the monitoring and control of the intense bremsstrahlung beams produced by clinical and other linear electron accelerators. The present paper describes the design, construction, and operation of special self-powered detectors for indicating the centroid of the bremsstrahlung beam profile."
"A description is given of a proposed new particle detector capable of measuring dE/dx and residual energy values of energetic heavy mass cosmic ray nuclei (Z>26) with energies as low as 1 MeV/nucleon, a region of information not accessible by other known means. The unique advantages of this detector assembly as it is envisaged for space flight experiments are listed."
"A broadband current preamplifier was developed to complement nuclear spectroscopy systems requiring linear gating. The preamplifier stage configuration consists of an FET input, a broadband interstage current gain section, and a high-impedance feedback network. The preamplifier produces a noise line width comparable to charge-sensitive designs having similar parameters. Because of large bandwidths and low-noise performance, the preamplifier, connected directly to a fast leading-edge discriminator, generates very accurate timing data. A preamplifier consisting of three gain stages was built and subsequently tested with Ge(Li) detectors. This preamplifier had a current gain of 10,000, a rise time of 8 nsec with a 10 pF detector capacitance, and a 0-pF noise line width, using an RC-RC ungated filter, of 1.4 keV (fwhm Ge). With the preamplifier operating from a 10 cc Ge(Li) coaxial detector, timing experiments utilizing the 60Co gamma cascade indicated resolutions as low as 1.15 nsec fwhm."
"The fast counting of high energy gamma events with excellent resolution is made possible by the design of a recycling preamplifier and a direct-coupled spectrometer system. Measurements were performed with a 40 cc Ge(Li) coaxial detector. Data were observed with and without pile-up rejection for count rates up to 150,000 counts/s. Resolution without pile-up rejection for 60Co was 2.50 keV FWHM at 75,000 counts/s (1.5-μs shaping). The exceptional performance of this direct-coupled system is mainly attributed to the preamplifier which requires no pole-zero compensation. After single differentiation the pulses return precisely to the baseline."
"This paper describes a novel technique of charge restoration - the drain feedback, based on the characteristics of the gate-to-drain junction of the input FET. The restoration charge required at the input of the preamplifier is generated by impact ionization in high-field regions of the FET. Actually the feedback is obtained by regulating the drain voltage according to the input energy count-rate product and consequently adjusting the electric field for the necessary charge generation. In the first part of the paper the principles of impact ionization in semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures are outlined and applied to junction FET's (JFET's) under saturation conditions. Then, the properties of FET gate leakage current generated by impact ionization are analyzed. Finally, the continuous mode of operation of the new feedback method is presented, and results from its application in x-ray spectroscopy with silicon and germanium detectors are given. Superior noise and count-rate performance coupled with simplicity and reliability are the outstanding features of the drain feedback method. It is the first feedback method in which the cryogenic input stage comprises the detector and the FET without the parasitic increases of stray capacitance or light-induced leakage currents characteristic of the other resistorless configurations."
"A filter with a trapezoidal weighting function is the optimum one when both noise and variations in the charge collection time are present, A trapezoidal filter was realized by a time-variant (gated filter) system. This paper presents the results obtained with large germanium detectors at high rates and higher energies, showing that trapezoidal filtering is essential for good resolution in this case."
"This paper discusses the design of a reference pulser and air-dielectric capacitor for use in stabilization of high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometers. Additionally, the adverse effects of coaxial cable series resistance and detector coupling capacitor instability are considered. The reference pulser circuitry is completely transistorized and features a highly-stable dual-transistor pulse generation network. The temperature stability of the pulser output is ⪇ ±5 PPM/°C from 10°C to 50°C. The long-term stability is approximately ±. 02 channels per day. The air-dielectric capacitor is a three-terminal device constructed of Kovar-steel and glass. The rigid glass-metal seal insures long-term stability. The capacitance temperature coefficient from liquid nitrogen to room temperature is approximately + 10 ppM/° C. Data are presented which shows that the series resistance of a coaxial cable will cause significant pulse drift when terminated and essentially no drift if left unterminated. An analysis also indicates that drift in a detector coupling capacitor can produce uncorrectable spectral drift."
"This paper introduces a new concept in nuclear pulse filtering, that of using linear active feedback to accomplish a pulse manipulation which until now has been performed only by nonlinear methods. The linear method eliminates threshold effects and extends the circuit application to low level and to highly linear signals, without the inherent increase in noise produced by the nonlinear methods. A linear circuit has been constructed which performs the function of D. C. restoration. That is, pulses which occur randomly in time and have low frequency components which overlap to produce degradation of primary pulse information, may be clarified and separated by the circuit. The action is similar to the basic Robinson restorer except that no threshold or other nonlinearity is involved and no noise need be introduced. The results are otherwise comparable, and time of pulse recovery to 0.01% of signal level may be traded off against reduction of signal amplitude."
"The energy range over which signal timing can be made nearly independent of amplitude and rise time has been extended downward by about an order of magnitude by employing dual priming of a zero crossing discriminator. By introducing another coarsely compensated timer between the high resolution timer and its priming leading edge discriminator, one can optimize the timing accuracy without sacrifice of dynamic range. Time walk of less than 1 ns has been achieved from about 20 keV to over 1 MeV."
"A high-rate gamma-ray spectroscopy system with a 40 cc Ge(Li) coaxial detector is described which utilizes a direct-coupled recycling preamplifier, a unipolar Gaussian filter amplifier with only one differentiating network, and a pileup rejector and baseline inspection circuit, to yield excellent resolution. A family of resolution curves is shown as a function of the input count rate (from 50K cps to 175K cps) and of the actual data acceptance rate. For an input rate of 100K cps and an acceptance rate of 5.5K cps the FWHM and FWl/10M for the 1.33-MeV peak of 60Co was 2.2 keV and 4.24 keV, respectively. The system lends itself to high counting rates by eliminating the need for pole-zero compensation and baseline restoration."
"The development of a fast transient recording system is described. A magnetic thin film is used to record an electrical signal in the form of a domain wall. The recorder has a risetime on the order of a nanosecond and a dynamic range of better than 30 dB. Readout of the record is compatible with computer (megabit) cycle times."
"Some practical examples are given for circuits enabling simultaneous conversion of several correlated or noncorrelated parameters with one ADC. The analog memories (stretchers) used as buffers introduce a dispersion due to the nonideal stretcher, when noncorrelated parameters are converted. A method of calculation is given to evaluate the dispersion introduced by the circuit. In the case of an important dispersion a symmetrisation of the data around the correct value is proposed so that the dispersion is reduced by a factor two."
"The performance of real-time systems depends or the combination of data acquisition and processing times. Programmed input-output is too slow and data channels are insufficiently flexible for general use with CAMAC. The provision of a separate peripheral processor gives optimum real-time performance. The overall design philosophy and the implications for system software are discussed."

"An electronic technique for separating the signals from a phoswich detector is discussed. The preamp output signal is amplified by two double delay line amplifiers operating in parallel. The time difference between the crossover points of the two amplifier output signals is measured. This time difference is a function of the detector pulse shape. For small pulses, this technique has less time jitter than the more usual leading edge/crossover measurement. It is also less sensitive to control misadjustments. An instrument based on this principle is described."
"Three different types of low power pulse shape discriminators have been designed and built for applications in space experiments. Their dynamic range, ability to separate mixtures, and sensitivity to photon statistics have been measured using a phoswich detector and an LED pulser which simulates the scintillation signals. The performance of the discriminators compare favorably with an analytic investigation."
"The design and construction of fast logic modules for nuclear instrumentation has always been a costly and time consuming effort. The demands for and on modules have increased considerably; greater quantities with improved performance capabilities are needed. Improved performance and reduced module cost are obtained by using commercially available emitter-coupled logic and a minimal amount of interface circuitry to form compatible functional circuits which can then be combined to create the various modules necessary for nuclear instrumentation. This paper describes the operation of several functional circuits that have been designed at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory to effectively utilize the Motorola MECL III line of integrated logic circuits in NIM Standard fast logic modules. The modules process pulses with rise and fall times of approximately 1 ns and can operate at pulse repetition rates in excess of 300 MHz, yet their cost is less than half that of commercially available 200 MHz units."
"A 16-channel discriminator-gated latch CAMAC module using MECL II has been designed and built for use in a phototube trigger hodoscope array. The module includes individual discriminator outputs, analog summing outputs, and high speed digital multiplicity outputs which are processed by an \"analyzer\" in order to decide if the particle multiplicity is suitable for streamer chamber firing. Latch data are transmitted to a PDP-9 for recording and further processing."
"A versatile system of circuits intended to make up modules for a subnanosecond coincidence - anticoincidence logic and a supervisory nanosecond logic is described. The signal resolution of the discriminators is 5 ns, the time resolution of the modules for many - fold coincidence operation is 0.5 ns. The temperature range for reliable module operation is 15 - 55 °C."
"A new high performance two-channel gate generator in a triple NIM module using integrated circuits is described. Its main characteristics are the digital design and the generation of both delay and width of a signal, relative to a trigger pulse, in each channel."
"A feedback method of digital measuring of the rate of statistically distributed pulses is described. The system adapts automatically to the situation at its input. If great changes of measured quantity are observed, the output follows these changes fast with greater standard deviation; later the first \"estimation\" of the value of measured quantity is further improved. The basic dynamic properties as well aa standard deviation both at transient and steady-state are described and dynamic properties of various methods of digital rate measuring are compared. The desoribed method of rate measuring can be applied also to digital measuring of relative rate n/no or of rate relative difference (n - no)/no."
"A particle spectrometer possessing high spectral and spatial/temporal resolution for the measurement of energetic protons, electrons and alpha particles over a broad energy and intensity range during solar particle events (SPE) was successfully launched aboard a polar-orbiting satellite on 17 October 1971. The spectrometer consists of a multi-element, silicon detector stack mounted within a plastic scintillator guard counter to form a particle telescope. The spectra of protons in the energy range 1.2-100 MeV, electrons from 0.88-1.6 MeV and alpha particles from 1.6-500 MeV are measured in four time-shared modes of operation with dual 256-channel pulse-height analyzers (PHA) of the successive-approximation type. Integral counting rates from each of the main elements of the telescope and the guard counter are measured every 32 milliseconds with low-power CMOS digital counters to provide high spatial/temporal resolution on the solar particle fluxes. Complete spectra on all three particle types over the above energy ranges are obtained every few seconds. A detailed description of the spectrometer, including a discussion of the mode logic which enhances the counting statistics in selected energy ranges, the dual pulse-height analyzers and the methods of obtaining the high temporal resolution is presented. Preliminary worldwide flight data obtained from two identical spectrometers oriented at different directions to the particle flux are also presented."
"Laboratory measurements have been made of the response of two typical cosmic ray detector systems to electrons between 0.2 and 2.0 MeV. The detector systems investigated were included in the Caltech Solar and Galactic Cosmic Ray Experiment aboard NASA's OGO-VI spacecraft and the Chicago/ Caltech Low Energy Cosmic Ray Experiment aboard OGO-IV. Working laboratory versions of each of these particle telescopes were exposed to the monoenergetic electron beam from a magnetic spectrometer. The results of pulse height and counting rate measurements indicate that electrons scattered from the anti-coincidence cup comprise about 25% of the total number arriving at the top of the detector stack. In certain cases, the contribution of these scattered particles to the total number of electrons detected can reach 65%. Suggestions are made for applying these results to other detector systems."
"It is possible to distinguish X-ray events from particle events in proportional counters on the basis of the difference in rise time between the pulses that result from both kinds of event. A number of different circuit configurations for achieving rise time discrimination have been evaluated and their performance compared. Rise time spectra of Fe55 and Co60 have been obtained in several different gas mixtures."
"On 12 December 1970, the UHURU (SAS-A) X-ray observatory was launched into equatorial orbit with the prime mission of conducting an all-sky survey of astronomical X-ray sources with intensities of 5 × 10-5 Sco-Xl or greater. Featuring two large area proportional counter detector systems, the experiment has operated without a failure and is returning information of great interest to the scientific community. This paper will aid in understanding the scientific data by presenting the system design and performance in engineering terms. Descriptions will be presented of the signal processing, aspect determination, in-flight calibration, command and telemetry formatting systems."
"An x-ray imaging system using a pin-hole camera and a position sensitive proportional counter at the image plane has been designed for an all-sky x-ray monitor for UK-5 satellite. This high-sensitivity device with real-time coverage of the entire celestial sphere would aid in programming satellite maneuvers such that transient events in the x-ray sky could be investigated in detail by the other primary satellite experiments. Discussion of design criteria for the camera geometry, the position sensitive proportional detector, and electronics to handle the data are presented in this paper."
"The OSO-H Solar X-Ray instrument monitors x-rays from the sun in the energy range 1 - 300 keV, as well as charged particle background. The electronics provide accurate logarithmic pulse-height analysis at the high counting rates expected under flare conditions. A high time resolution mode enables study of the temporal development of a solar flare."
"A 3\" × 3\" NaI(Tl) gamma ray (0.3 to 10 MeV) spectrometer with a CsI(Na) charged particle and anti-Compton shield has been developed for the ORBITING SOLAR OBSERVATORY (OSO-7) which was launched September 30, 1971. The instrument, designed for a rotating wheel compartment, utilizes a 377 channel quadratic PHA with accumulation times of 3, 1, or 0.5 minutes. Quick look and calibration data obtained via a direct data link to a minicomputer at the UNH campus allows near real time monitoring and control of the experiment. Various commands changing the operating mode can be executed. The functions which can be commanded include: rotation of the quadrants in which data is collected by 90°; gain adjustment of the central detector over a 6:1 range; manual or automatic sequencing of calibrations; variation of accumulation times by telemetering selected channels; and selection of reference directions. A small X-ray detector covering the range 7.5 to 120 keV is also included."
"A flight-worthy pulse height analyzer that has a quadratic transfer function is described. This quadratic function permits optimum usage of the entire PHA dynamic range due to the quadratic nature of the gamma ray spectrometer's resolution vs. energy. After the theoretical design discussion, the implementation of the design is examined and test results described. The analyzer is part of the University of New Hampshire Gamma Ray Monitor for OSO-H."
"Alpha particle resolution of a surface barrier detector/preamplifier combination is adversely affected by excessive noise of the detector. The detector noise increases when the substrate is exposed at the site of contamination introduced into the coated wafer surfaces during the manufacture of the detector. Mechanisms by which substrate exposure may occur are presented in this paper. Increase in detector noise by substrate exposure is shown to follow the basic photoconductivity equation. Noise performance of a detector with surface contamination is observed to have three modes of degradation, depending upon the nature of contamination. Of the three modes, the third one caused by an outgassing/insulating type of contamination is sporadic in nature and is difficult to identify. Long-term vacuum cycling tests are evolved to identify this mode of degradation."

 "ARIEL is a collective system conceived in an Institute having 3 particle accelerators and a Nuclear Spectrometry center, in order to allow several research teams to incorporate a powerful computer into their experimental equipment. ARIEL uses a 360/50 IBM to handle simultanéously 4 remote, independent, on-line experiments. The machine runs in a multiprogramming mode under an operating system IBM OS 360 MFT that we modified to do simultaneously several real-time jobs. We have connected to the computer specilly designed units implementing data acquisition, graphic and literal dialogue with the experimenter and the data reduction and editing of the results. A large software using supervisor extensions enables the scientist a simple FORTRAN use of all these units, starting from the preparation of the experiment to the editing of the final results. ARIEL has been designed in 1965, making use of the experience gained by the use during several years of a first collective system (1961). About a hundred different experiments performed on ARIEL since 1968 showed us the value of the choices we made."
 "A buffered electronic Data Transfer Interface has been developed for acquiring data from 1-14 Ge(Li) and/or NaI(Tl) gamma spectrometers and processing this data in an IBM 1130 Minicomputer System. Sample instrument and spectrum data are transferred between remote spectrometers and mass storage buffer and between buffer and processor as standard formatted data files. Spectrometers and the processor are serviced on a time-sharing basis in accordance with a multiple service demand queue. The first record of each magnetic tape data file consists of a serial file number and all samples and instrument data. Sample and instrument data, including sample number, sample group code, accummulate time, configuration code, energy range code, energy calibration code, instrument number and analysis code, are entered from punched sample cards, thumbwheel switches and a time of year clock. All subsequent data file records consist of spectra data. Operation of the data interface is initiated from individual spectrometers, the data interface Control and Data Unit or from the processor. Part of the data interface was installed and placed in continuous operation with one Ge(Li) spectrometer in 1970. Additional spectrometers and interface equipment are currently being added to complete the system."
"A bidirectional, 16-bit data bus, which forms an extension of a \"mini\"-computer I-O bus, has been designed, including a controller for the bus, which allows individual control of up to 512 digital devices. One such device, a dual, programmable, 100 MHz, 16-bit scaler has also been designed and coupled to the bus. The circuits for the controller, bus, and scaler circuits are constructed of readily available TTL integrated circuits; therefore, this system could be adapted to most small computers."
"The system described in this paper generates a set of semiconductor device driving pulses, logarithmic in time, which are used to display a sequence of characteristic responses on a scope. The system is especially suited for damage annealing studies following a radiation (neutron, gamma, electron) pulse. The sequence of measurements begins as soon as 50ns after the beginning of the radiation pulse and can be terminated after milliseconds, seconds, hours, or even a day. This is the only system known which can produce this range of times on a single oscilloscope picture. Representative data from experiments designed to measure the turn-on characteristics of a MOSFET following electron irradiation, the DC gain (hfE) of a 2N2222-A transistor following electron irradiation, and the fast beta annealing of transistors following a 14 MeV neutron burst, are given."

This paper describes a device which has been designed to replace both the computer and the Branch Driver of many systems - at less than half the cost. Algen (a contraction of algorithm generator) may also be used with a computer, serving as a unique Branch Driver which can relieve the computer program of many \"housekeeping\" duties."

"CAMAC provides an interface through which a computer interacts with its environment. External parameters are represented by hardware registers which are accessed by the computer in a unifom manner, therefore explicit I/O coding is unnecessary.

 "The evaluation of the engineering problems of fusion reactors has just begun. Worldwide, it is estimated to be the part-time effort of fewer than fifty scientists and engineers. A few thoughts have been outlined here. The essence of the problem is still one of plasma physics; the demonstration of stable confinement of a thermonuclear plasma. Engineering models are, therefore, best guesses at present confinement schemes extrapolated to reactor conditions. Many of the technical problems are however, model-free and universally applicable. There must be some advanced state of preparation for construction of a reactor once scientific feasibility is proven. The success of this program means the satisfaction of global energy needs for the foreseeable future."

Resonant cavity techniques, both cylindrical and Fabry-Perot types, are treated. Broad coverage of microwave interferometers is given indicating the advantages and disadvantages of the various schemes. A summary table is presented to aid the experimentalist to select the most appropriate measuring system for the prevailing experimental conditions i. e. density range of interest, steady state or transient conditions, large or small plasmas etc."
"Measurements of the electron cyclotron radiation emitted from the plasma of the Alice system were made using a synchronous detection microwave radiometer in the range of 10.2 - 11.6 GHz. Both sidebands were used to samle radiation from two nested closed shells within the plasma. For a tenuous plasma this radiation is proportional to the product of the electron density and the electron temperature. Since measurements of the plasma density were available from other detectors, relative values of the electron temperature were obtained using the measured radiation intensity."

"A \"multi-time-delay sampling\" technique is described in which the effective sampling rate is increased while the sampling rate of the digitizer is held fixed. The technique has been utilized to extend the analysis bandwidth of an analog-digital, plasma data acquisition and processing system to 1.5 MHz. Such an enhancement in band-width capability is extremely valuable in analyzing phenomena associated with turbulent plasmas. Results are presented using known waveforms and actual plasma data in order to demonstrate the extended bandwidth capability provided by this technique."
"This paper describes an application of multiplexing and system self-testing to the rod control and status-monitoring system of a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR). The approach uses modularity at the field sensors with minimum interconnecting cables to the control room. The coding of the signal words employs error-detecting techniques to improve system reliability and availability. Fault diagnostics and identification improve the maintainability of the system."
"Outlet temperature, channel flow-rate, boiling, fission-gas discharge and cover-gas entrainment can be detected from four wires of a pair of grounded-type sheathed chromel-alumel thermocouples inserted into the outlet open channel where magnetic flux traverses from a magnet circuit mounted inside the wrapper tube of individual subassembly of the liquid-metal-cooled fast breeder reactor. The modified conceptual design is presented. Use of magnet in the core environment for a period of time equal to the subassembly life seems hopeful according to reported informations. Simulation tests reveal its excellent stability and linearity just like an ordinary type. Calculated emf by an approximation is almost consistent with the measured. Shunt effect by the sheath is minor. Twenty-one proto-type magnet circuits are arraied in positions of the core-map. A continuous systematic arrangement is found to give nearly uniform flux density over the core. Two of them are built in a demonstration set, which is tested in sodium flow of up to 550°C. In actual use of the conceptual design, approximately 19 mV will be obtained against sodium flow of 10 m/sec at 650°C. Argon-gas is injected into stagnant and upflowing sodium. Significant noise is observed. Noise-amplitude monitoring is recommended for sensitive gas-void detection. In conclusion, this type is considered very promising in future LMFBR plants."
"A small diameter, gaseous Cerenkov detector has been developed for use as a reactor power monitor. Measurements have confirmed its ability to detect power-related high energy prompt gammas while discriminating against a significant flux of low energy fission product decay gammas. Other advantages of the detector are also mentioned."
"Operating theory and characteristics given in this paper concern a dual property measurement sensor and associated instrumentation for use with liquid metal cooled, fast breeder nuclear reactors. The sensor may also be applied in other similar severe environments. Pressure variations are sensed by deflection of a thin diaphragm which forms one end wall of a resonant cylindrical microwave cavity. Temperature changes cause the cavity size, and thus its resonant frequency to vary. Both physical properties may be continuously monitored as each relates to a distinct mode of cavity resonance. Precise digital readout of the resonant frequencies indicated a sensor sensitivity to pressure of about 9 MHz/psi (for null pressure scheme of operation), and to temperature of 350 kHz/°F. As both the sensor and connecting waveguide are entirely of metal, direct immersion in a liquid metal coolant should be possible."
"A versatile gamma scanning system has been designed and installed for the scanning of irradiated fuels. The system traverses a fuel pin past an area-defining slit in a reproducible and accurate manner. Activity from the examined area is detected by a high resolution solid-state detector. Signals from the detector are amplified and routed to single channel analyzers or to a multichannel analyzer. The use of a four-input multichannel scalar permits storage of four specific energy groups versus position. A scan control module controls the operation of a stepping motor which moves the fuel pin axially past the collimator. Limit switches are used to define the scanned area. The control module also advances the multichannel scalar at selected intervals and determines the rate and direction of scanning. The use of a four-input multichannel scalar allows storage of data in four energy intervals from 512 consecutive points on the scanned element. For a typical pin this means that information is stored from 500 consecutive 27.5-mil increments. The unit is designed to scan fuel lengths of up to 50.2 in. in rods up to 84 in. long and from 0.2 to 1.125 in. in diameter. The collected information can be used to determine the distribution of activity in the fuel rod and to infer the relative distribution of specific isotopes. This information can be used to measure fuel burnup, fuel dimensions and power distribution. Other quantities of interest may be inferred from the obtained information."
"The power-to-reactivity frequency response of the High-Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) was measured over the range 0.01 to 5 Hz using periodic binary input signals introduced with normal system control rods. These results served to validate the theoretical model used in the HFIR control and safety studies and to aid in assessing this testing procedure for use in large power reactors where special test equipment or interference with normal operation cannot be tolerated."
"A portable digital system for rapid on-line calculation of reactivity during nuclear plant physics testing has been designed and implemented. This system allows auxiliary data logging, formatting, and transmission to remote computer systems for further analysis. Provisions are made for operator displays as well as off-line computation within the system."
"With the increasing interest and emphasis in safety and environmental effects of nuclear generating stations by Governmental as well as public and private agencies, the necessity of having extremely reliable control and instrumentation systems is one of the major items that must be considered in the operation of a nuclear generating station. Extensive initial testing, routine testing and maintenance of the operating plant is essential to locate and eliminate problems that could negate the correct operation of Control and Instrumentation systems. This paper discusses some of the Control and Instrumentation system problems and their solutions encountered at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station."
"This paper describes five problems covering the design and operating experience with the control and instrumentation systems for the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station Unit 1. This unit is a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor system developed by Gulf General Atomic in cooperation with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Philadelphia Electric Company, and the High-Temperature Reactor Development Associates, Inc., composed of 53 U.S. utility companies. It has been in commercial service on the system of Philadelphia Electric since June 1967. In general, the problems encountered during startup and operation do not reveal any new areas requiring special attention from a design standpoint. Rather, the experience to date reconfirms the known requirements for designing trouble-free instrumentation and control systems. Lest attention be focused only on the problems encountered, it would be well to remark on the successful operation of the instrumentation and control systems. Operations to date have shown relatively few instrumentation problems beyond those that fall under the category of normal maintenance. The control system response has closely matched the design predictions. The protection systems have responded, without failure, when required. False trips have not occurred except on a few occasions when problems occurred during routine testing."
"The Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant is a 545 Mwe Unit powered by a General Electric boiling water reactor. Monticello achieved initial criticality on December 10, 1971 and began commercial operation on July 4, 1971 at the completion of a turnkey contract with the General Electric Company. Bechtel Corporation was the prime contractor. This paper reports on some of the unusual instrumentation problems encountered during the startup of the Monticello Plant. These problems are as follows: 1. Moisture Separator Drain Tank Level Control Problems. 2. Protection System Relay Failures. 3. Setpoint Drift of Protection System Vacuum Switches. 4. False High Pressu re Coolant Injection System Steam Flow Signals. 5. Instrument Manifold Valve Problems. Hopefully, these problems are of a general enough nature so that the Monticello experiences can benefit a majority of the readers."
  "Physical separation of electrical equipment in the BWR Control Room complex is a difficult task requiring a considerable amount of attention to details. However, with adequate pre-planning and the proper arrangement of safety system panels, complications can be avoided and simplification of the design and installation can be achieved. This paper has been prepared with the thought that it might provide useful guidance to the designer who is unfamiliar with BWR separation requirements, and provide alternate methods to designers who have had previous experience in this area. The author welcomes comments and an exchange of views with interested readers."
"This paper covers the application of \"Separation Criteria\" in the design of a control room for a nuclear power plant whose prime mover is a pressurized water reactor (PWR). The guidelines and requirements established in these separation criteria are built upon the requirements stated in IEEE \"Criteria for Nuclear Power Plant Protection Systems,\" IEEE No. 279-1971 1), IEEE Criteria 308 2) and IEEE Separation Criteria SC-4."
"Examining today's nuclear boards from an unfettered viewpoint has suggested that significant advances can be made by applying lessons learned in the last 20 years in conventional plants. Drastic reduction in the number of operating steps required at the control board, consolidation and timesharing of memory serviced operating displays and operator-oriented use of arm-reach space appear desirable."
"The present main roles of reliability engineering methods in reactor safety are to improve the design of protection systems and to enhance quality assurance. This paper reviews the continuing efforts to strengthen the credibility of probabilistic safety evaluations and to expand the analysis role in guiding safety support activities. A trend toward situation-oriented analysis is noted, along with innovations in exploiting the limited information available for analysis input."
"The process of standards development is reviewed using the \"Criteria for the Periodic Testing of Nuclear Power Generation Station Protection Systems\" as an example. Areas considered include the need for a standard, the requirements of a standards document, draft preparation, and the obtaining of consensus and approval. Some of the problems of the consensus process are described. Responsibilities of the engineering community are reviewed."
"A computer program DIODRAD was written to solve equations similar to Misawals for radiation effects in IMPATT diodes. This program permits the user to select integration accuracy, doping profile, and operating conditions in calculating the effects of neutron fluence and gamma flux on diode performance. Results from this work compare favorably with previous theoretical and experimental data."
 "A new thermometry for liquid sodium, which stands on the low resistivity and the moderate thermo-emf of liquid sodium, has been developed upon the demand on the individual subassembly outlet instrumentation in the sodium-cooled fast-breeder reactor, which requires \"the more reliable and precise informations with the higher sensitivity at the less sacrifice and cost\". Unusual thermo-electric combinations of \" chromel-sodium-alumel\" and \"chromel-sodium-chromel\" are studied to obtain more informations through the same number of sensors and lead-wires. Also a unique combination of \"stainless steel-sodium-stainless steel\" is tried as the fast-response temperature fluctuation detector, which would make the detection of a few overheated pins in one subassembly possible. These feasibilities are preliminarily analized. The transient responses are graphically solved by a newly developed method. Some interesting presuppositions are obtained. Experiments are proceeded on the existing sodium loops, on the simple sodium pot, and on some melting solder baths. No definite objection raises. The new thermometry is considered to be feasible and useful, not only as the individual subassembly instrumentation, but also as the surface temperature detector, as the temperature fluctuation detectors for the transit-time and Karman vortex flowmeters, and as some experimental means for liquid sodium."

    "A review is given of fundamental processes leading to the production of multicharged ions by electron-atom collision : direct electron ejection, Auger process, electron shake-off. Results concerning ionization crosssections by electron impact are discussed. Some approximate methods allowing to a good knowledge of the ionic population in different types of ion sources (hot plasma devices, laser ion source, electron bombardment and discharge sources). At the end, some problems concerning emittance and brightness of heavy multicharged ion sources are examined."
"A survey on questions related to the production of multiply charged ions with the Duoplasmatron ion source is given. In spite of differences of the multiply charged ion source and the mass separator type, design considerations show that high containment is a common feature to be attained in both subjects. Multiply charged metal ions are produced by material evaporation into the magnetically confined anodic plasma and auxiliary gas feed into the cathode discharge regions. Energy spreads of ion beams from the low and the high arc current source are compared. The Duoplasmatron ion source proves to be a hygieneous source of high containment that permits the production of medium charge states up to 9+ for xenon at modest energy spread and good brilliance of the extracted ion beam in a high current-low voltage discharge mode."
"A review is given of the performance and characteristics of the various types of PIG sources used for the production of multiply charged ions. They are able to produce ions with a high charge to mass ratio for the lighter elements up to about neon, but for heavier elements the ratio fallssteadily. Charge states do not exceed 8 to 10 for argon and 12 for xenon. Although the development of the multiply charged PIG source, since its original inception, has been very slight, it is still the most powerful practical design in existence atl this time. A brief description of the general characteristics and the mechanisms involved in the PIG discharge are given , including a discussion of multiply charged ion production."
"The design of the UNILAC injector was particularly governed by aspects of maintenance and reliable performance. Thus an open air 254 kV high gradient single gap acceleration was chosen for Uranium 11+ particles, corresponding to an injection energy of 11.7 keV/amu and a charge-to-mass ratio of 0.046. This allows fast ion source changes because only a short time for tube conditioning is required and takes into account the lifetime of present sources for multiply-charged heavy ions. Two independent Faraday-rooms, symmetrically arranged to the axis of the main accelerator, are housing each a 300 kV oil-insulated Cockcroft-Walton generator, a duoplasmatron and a Penning source with the associated equipment. Hereby a fast switch over to the stand-by source in case of an ion source failure is provided. Magnetic quadrupole lenses focus and match the beam through a magnetic deflection system, a 50 Hz chopper and a double drift buncher into the linac."
"Measurements of voltage-, current-and gas flow dependencies of a cold cathode Penning source, using different cathode materials, are reported. The influence of the discharge parameters (arc voltage, arc current, magnetic field and gas flow) on the production of higher charge states was studied. The highest observed charge states were Ar9+ , Kr12+ Xe13+ The cold cathode type Penning source with radial extraction proves to have sufficiently low energy spread to permit isotope separation in the source-magnet field. Results for Ar2+, Kr4+ and Xe7+ as well as emittance measurements are given."
"The radial density profiles and emittance have been measured for N+ and N2+ beams from a Penning-type ion source that has a hot filament. It was found that the emittance for an extraction voltage of 12 kV and for 50% of the beanw as 21 cm-mrad for N+ and about 12 cm-mrad for N2+ The difference between these two areas may, in part, be explained by a charge state dependence due to different velocities of the two ion beams."
"Electron cyclotron resonance was detected in a Penning source by measuring the electron temperature as obtained from the x-ray emission spectrum. The resonance is only present if flat cathodes are used."
"The ion source described in this contribution allows the production of considerable ion beam intensities of highly charged ions. The electron density is increased by an additional electron gun. The decrease-of the ratio of neighbouring charge states is similar to the decrease of the ratio of the ionization cross sections by electron impact from which one event ionization processes are assumed to be of major importance in the performance of this source."
"For the generation of heavy ions at high charge states, the cold-cathode Penning discharge ion source requires a power supply capable of both the high potential essential for striking an arc and the high current for sustaining it. A series-regulated power supply developed at Oak Ridge provides up to 6 kV of striking voltage and up to 12 amperes of arc current. The power supply operates in a constant current mode with the arc voltage dependent on the gas pressure in the ion source. With this source in ORIC, the typical operating conditions are 5 to 10 amperes arc current, 600 to 2000 volts arc potential, and 5 to 20 kW power dissipation in the arc. A larger power supply is planned for extending the arc current to about 25 amperes. Various arrangements, including pre-regulators and multiple power supplies, are under consideration to reduce power dissipation in the series regulator tubes."
 "The range of ions accelerated by the V.E.C. has recently been extended to metal ions. For example, a 5 to 10 μA beam of 48 MeV 58Ni6+ is now available and has been used by a customer. This beam has become possible as a result of success in adapting the normal ion source for the production of metal ions. The problem was to add to the ion source a controlled source of metal vapour without increasing the size of the ion source or adding separate oven heaters and controls. This has been achieved by inserting a graphite liner into the existing ion source chimney, the metal being embedded in the liner and out of direct contact with the arc. Provided the arc power exceeds a few kilowatts, the metal becomes molten and the vapour diffuses through the graphite into the arc which then becomes self-sustaining. With nickel (the most widely tested so far), intensity at full radius of between 10 and 20 μA of 6+ ions and 1μA of 8+ ions is readily obtained and source life averages about 4 hours. Other metals such as cobalt, iron, chromium and copper give similar results."
"The design and performance of the ion source which is now used in the IPCR variable energy cyclotron are described. The source is of the electron-bombarded hot cathode type having two cylindrical cathodes of tungsten and a water-cooled copper anode containing a replaceable molybdenum slit plate. The arc discharge is established continuously but not pulsed. The source is usually operated very stably under an arc power of 1.5 to 3kW with a gas flow rate of 1 to 2 cc/min. The lifetime of the source is mainly limited by the erosion of the upper tungsten cathode at about 24 hours. At present, C4+, N4+, O4+, N5+ and O5+ ions are accelerated up to 48~100, 56~1100, 70~95, 56~125 and 70~125 MeV respectively, and a few micro-amperes of these ions are extracted from the cyclotron. The vacuum obtainable in the accelerating chamber is usually 2 ~ 4 × 10-6 mHg, and the loss of ion beam by the charge exchange effect is comparatively small. Extracted ion beams are used in several experiments for about 1900 hours in a year."
"Production of multiply-charged ions of Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe has been studied by use of an electron-bombarded hot cathode type ion source of the IPCR 160cm cyclotron, which is similar to Morozov's source. These multiply-charged ions were accelerated by a 3rd harmonics acceleration mode in the cyclotron and detected with a beam probe fixed at the radius of 55cm. Observed multiply-charged ions are Ne2+, Ne3+, Ne4+, Ne5+, Ar3+, Ar4+ Ar5+, Ar6+, Ar7+, Ar8+, Kr6+, Kr7+, Kr8+, Kr9+, Xe9+, Xe10+ and Xe11+. Relative abundance of each charge state of four elements were measured. In case of Kr and Xe , the intensity of observed multiply-charged ions decreased to 1/3 or 1/4 when the charge number is increased by one. Intensities of Ar4+, Ar6+, Ar8+, Kr6+ and Kr8+ were measured as a function of the operation conditions of the ion source, such as arc voltage, arc power and gas flow rate. It was found that a smaller gas flow and a higher arc power brought about a higher yield in all the measured ions. Obtained current intensities of ion source output are 40#x003BC;A Ar8+, 600#x003BC;A Kr6+, 40#x003BC;A Kr9+, 150#x003BC;A Xe9+ and 10#x003BC;A Xe11+ respectively."
"A new internal Penning ion source is now being tested for production of nitrogen and oxygen beams. Nitrogen beams of N5+ have been accelerated to 250 MeV. An external source for lithium beams is being developed."
"One year of operation of a heavy-ion Penning source in the Oak Ridge Isochronous Cyclotron has resulted in the acceleration of a number of isotopes of 17 elements, ranging from boron to tantalum. The method of positive identification of these beams and the operational techniques used to develop certain beams are described. Comparison of the extracted particle current for a given charge state with the calculated ionization potential has resulted in a systematic understanding of particle currents to be expected for undeveloped beams. In particular, shell effects and total ionization potential must both be considered in predicting beam intensities. The particle currents of ArR8+ Ar9+ and Ar10+ provide a sensitive test for the comparison of multiple and single impact calculations. The data are in agreement with multiple impact calculations. Also, low energy x-rays emitted from the Penning source have been detected and the observed spectra characterize the two modes of source operation."
"Considering basic properties of the EBIS, as vacuum requirements, ion yield, and emittance, it is pointed out, that the EBIS - as proposed by Donets - is restricted in priciple to a poor yield of highly charged ions, To overcome this, a concept for a \"dynamic containment\" is presented. This means, that the axial ion movement between first ionization and the extraction is delayed in order to give the necessary containment time at CW-operation. Realization seems to be possible by the partly permeable mirrors, produced by the axial alternating magnetic field of opposing permanent ring magnets, which also provide for electron focusing, considerable reduction of vacuum requirements, and saving of power consumption."
"A proposal is presented in this work for a new type of ion source that employs a hyperbolic potential field for the dual purpose of trapping the plasma ions, and permitting the electrons to impact the trapped ions successively, which by turn render the ions highly stripped. The pvwposed souroe consists of an axially symmetric hyperbolic Penning assembly energized with fixed and cosinusoidal voltage and is immersed in a homogeneous axial magnetic field. The anode and both of the two cathodes follow hyperboloid surfaces of one and two sheets respectively. Extraction of the stripped ions can be accomplished either radially or axially through an extracting system, which is optimized to satisfy Pierce conditions of rectilinear flow. Filtering the extracted ions is done by a quadrupole mass analyzer. Under the influence of the imposed hyperbolic potential field, electrons are allowed to ascillate with bound or unbound trajectories depending on the operating conditions. From the solutions of the equations of motion governing such oscillating electrons, it is possible to optimize the overall performance of the proposed ion source."
"We have developped a way for studying the ion generation in the plasma of ion sources. From the results of our first calculations we try to give some conclusions about the efficiency of various field pattern and we present the related experimental program we intend to work out."
"Some properties of an electron-bombardment type simplified ion source for high temperature operation to obtain heavy ions are studied. And some properties of a multiply-charged ion source of the two stages, which is constructed of the simplified ion source and the beam-plasma type ion source developed by the present authors, are also studied. In the simplified ion source we utilize the magnetic field induced by the filament coil effectively, so that there is no external magnetic coil. The discharge chamber can be designed very small. It is easy to raise the temperature of the discharge chamber higher than 1200°C and is possible to operate stably at high temperatures. It is shown that several metal ions can be obtained easily and sufficiently from materials in solid states at a room temperature. A multiply-charged ion source of two stages is developed. For the first stage the simplified ion source is used to provide singly-charged ions for the beam-plasma discharge field. In the second stage the beam-plasma discharge is used to produce multiply-charged ions efficiently. A high degree of electron stripping of ions occurs in the presence of energetic electrons of high density generated by beam-plasma discharge due to the beam-plasma interactions. Some properties of this source are studied. The properties of a newly-designed simplified ion source of electron-bombardment type are presented in the first place. Secondly the features of a multiply-charged ion source of two stages are presented."
 "The ratio between electron temperature and ion temperature in a hot plasma is calculated, using the following assumptions. The ion life time in the plasma is considered to be large as compared to the time required for the energy relaxation between different ion species. Ion confinement is due to an electrostatic potential well resulting from ambipolar diffusion in a trap confining the electrons. The different heating and cooling processes are considered and it is found that the ion temperature is proportional to the square of the average charge state of the plasma."
"The optimal design of sources for multiply-charged heavy ions depends upon a better understanding of the physical processes involved. In this paper the equations for ionization are developed and discussed. Charge state distributions are calculated for the single impact model (the simultaneous removal of several electrons from an atom) and for the multiple impact (the removal of one electron at a time) model. The calculated ion charge distributions are then compared with experimental data from Penning sources, for which the multiple impact process appears to predominate."
 "We present a review of the main results concerning the interaction between-laser and matter, in park. ticular the results concerning the state of charge, the energy and the spatial distribution of the plasma ions. From these results, we propose to use laser produced plasmas as sources of multiply-charged ions for heavy ion accelerators and we define the laser characteristics which would be required."
   "An ion source based on E.C.R. heating in a magnetic bottle works in our Laboratory since 1964. The characteristics of the plasma are: n = 1012 cm-3; w-> 1 keV ; W+ ~10 eV ; p > 10-5 torr. The microwave power P < 2 1KW at 10 GHz is coupled to the electrons either by a standing wave or a propagating wave. Our preliminary results with a 16 nA beam gave N+ = 44 %; N2+ = 36 % ; N3+ = 14 % ; N4+ = 4 % ; N5+ + N6++ N7+= 2 %. However due to the presence of H+2 the rate of N6+ and N7+ could not be measured correctly."
"Modifications to the Princeton Particle Accelerator (PPA) such as pulsed heavy ion source, extended range radiofrequency system, vacuum system improvements, allowed the adaptation of the 3 GeV proton synchrotron to the acceleration of heavier ions. Accele ation of nitrogen ions in a charge state of N5+ and N6+ to an energy of 4 and 7 GeV were achieved starting in July 1971. Present average intensities run at about 3 x 105 and 2 x 105 particles/sec. Expectations for acceleration of neon and argon in the near future will be discussed."
"A Phillips ion gauge source (Fig. 1) of the type used by the heavy ion accelerator in Berkeley has been adapted for use at the Bevatron. The objective was to achieve high charge state ions (4+, 5+) of carbon and nitrogen. All source parameters are pulsed. The ion source performance regarding linac acceleration is discussed. The light ion (deuteron, alpha) performance of the PIG source and duoplasmatron is compared."
 "The onset of ponderomotive oscillation, a radiation pressure driven mechanical oscillation, at 120 Hz was observed at low field strengths in a superconducting 130 MEz helical resonator suitable for use in a heavy ion accelerator. Thresholds were observed over a wide range of parameters such as RF Q's from 105 to 108 and mechanical Q's from 8 x 103 to 2 x 105. A typical minimum threshold value was 10-8 joule of RF energy in the resonator. A theory is presented which quantitatively explains all the threshold data. Hethods of damping ponderomotive oscillations are discussed."
"Losses in Al2 O3 rods, placed along the axis of a superconducting helical resonator, were observed at frequencies from 130 MHz to 450 MHz and at sample temperatures up to 20 K. Losses at 2 K corresponding to ϵ\"/ϵ' of 0.8 x 10-6 were found in the two different grades of sapphire tested. Losses associated with Cr+3 impurities were larger, corresponding to X\"/X' of 6 x 10-6 for pink ruby and 2 x 10-5 for red ruby at 130 MHz and 3 K. The ruby losses decreased with increasing temperature and increasing frequency. Magnetic coupling within the Cr3+ spin system seems to account for most of the ruby losses."
"Measurements of Q-values as a function of heat treatment and rf field strength for a reentrant niobium test cavity having a gap of one cm indicated that the high field performance was limited by field emission at 25 MV/m peak 5urface field. Q-values at low power of 1.2 x 109 at 4 K and 7 x 109 at 2 K wepe degraded to 2 x 108 at 4 K and 3 x 108 at 2 K after rf processing. Excellent stability was obtained by mechanical control of the resonant frequency of the cavity using a piezoelectric motor made of quartz transducers. The fractional tuning rate of the uncontrolled cavity resonance was observed to be 1.7 x 10-6 per Torr."
"A brief account is given of the types of ion sources employed for the production of negative ions. The application of these sources to a wide range of elements, grouped mainly by their physical characteristics is then considered."
"There are several well-established methods of producing negatively-charged heavy ion beams. When applied to the less abundant isotopes, these standard methods can become prohibitively expensive. Several techniques have been devised which make operation with separated isotopes comparable in cost with normal operation. These techniques are reviewed and methods are outlined by which further improvements in economy could be made."
"Measurements of equilibrium charge distributions for a wide variety of ions are being reported frequently in current literature. These measurements have improved the accuracy of various interpolations for velocity or ion species which may be needed in accelerator design or in planning experiments. Certain major effects and several minor ones have been identified and these must be considered in making such estimates. The relative importance of some of the factors affecting equilibrium distributions are discussed."
"A review is presented of extensive experimental data on average equilibrium charge states, q, of heavy ions penetrating through gaseous and solid media at energies up to 180 MeV. The usefulness of various semi-empirical methods to predict q is critically evaluated, and it is discussed to what extent these methods can be used for extrapolations into ranges where no measurements are available. Existing theoretical models are examined in detail and it is shown that the criterion by Bohr and Lamb is well suited to predict q with good accuracy in gaseous targets. A brief discussion is presented concerning the influence of the density of stripper targets on q."
"Equilibrium charge distributions of 1 MeV/ nucleon Ne, A and Kr ions were measured at the end of the Orsay linac using a Faraday cup. The same measurements were made for Kr at 4 MeV/nucleon and for A and Kr at 6 MeV/Nucleon with the help of solid state detectors on the ALICE beam. In the last case (Kr), the nonequilibrium distribution is also given for carbon thicknesses ranging from 10 to 200, μg/cm2."
"Cross sections of I4+ to I18+ for electron capture and loss have been measured in N2 and Ar at low pressure. It has been found that the dependence on charge and velocity of capture cross sections is strongly influenced by the atomic structure of the ion. The applicability of simple classical modele for the capture process has been investigated."
"Charge distribution measurements were made with 10-75 MeV iodine ions of various incident charge states traversing either a supersonic CO2-jet of variable density in the range 5 x 1014 to 1.5 x 1017 molecules/cm3 or a target of dilute CO2 with a maximum density of 5 x 1014 molecules/cm3. The equilibrium mean charge ts of the iodine ions in the jet is found to be higher than in the dilute gas. The maximum difference of about one charge unit is observed at 75 MeV. Ihere is no indication for a further increase of Lat gas densities above 5 x 1016 molecules/cm3. Cross sections for electron capture and loss were determined by means of a least-squares-evaluation of non-equilibrium charge distributions. Considerable decrease of the capture cross sections for some lower charge states has proved to be responsible for the increase ζ, whereas the loss cross sections do not change measurably with increasing target density."
   "The design concept of the Maryland Static-Field ERA is briefly reviewed. Two schemes of ion loading are being studied: 1. Fast loading by passing the electron ring through a gas region with pressures in the range of 10-3 torr 2. Stopping of the ring by resistive wire damping and slow ion loading while the ring is trapped in a small mirror well. & cceleration of the ions by the expansion and external E - field methods is discussed and the pertinent equations are presented. trameters for a possible heavy-ion ERA pruducing 1011 or more ions of energies up to 1500 MeV (uranium) are estimated."
"A collaboration group from the Barn and Lecce Universities has started some theoretical and experimental work on a new type of collective ion accelerator. Ion acceleration can be obtained by the electric field produced by an electron ring which drifts perpendicularly to the external magnetic field. The model machines which are now in construction are called ANEL, from the italian translation of E.R.A. ANEL 1 is a model of static field ERA, which will be used to study the injection, stability and ionization problems. ANEL 2 is a device designed to study the feasibility of a \"collective syncrotron\". The first injection tests are planned for 1972."
           "The predominant transistor noise sources are surveyed and related to both surface and bulk permanent damage radiation effects. The medium and high frequency noise performance of FET and bipolar transistors is not strongly affected by radiation until the devices themselves begin to fail. Low frequency 1/f noise is affected by relatively light radiation doses, but only with the junction FET can one make quantitative predictions of post-radiation noise performance. An additional noise source of very large amplitude is present while radiation induced photocurrent is being generated in transistors."
"The dual-input describing function concept is discussed with reference to a low-power nuclear reactor. Results of an earlier analysis, where the conrventional describing function of a low-power nuclear reactor was derived by using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin solution of the kinetics equations, are used to obtain the dual-input describing function of a low-power nuclear reactor. The dual-input describing function technique is applied to investigate the self-oscillations of a low-power nuclear reactor with external feedback. For a suitable frequency characteristic of the feedback, èxistence of an unstable limit-cycle is shown."

  "The measurement of optical waveforms in order to measure physical parameters (radiative li fetimes etc.) is dealt with. The influence of the detection and measurement system and causes of systematic and randon errors are analyzed. The inherently digital techniques ba sed on single photon (SP) detection are shown to have definite advantages over analog techniques. Two basic SP techniques are considered: SP gated counting (SPGC) and measurement of SP delay distribution (SPDD), which are complementary and cover a time range from subnanosecond to long times (> minutes). The time resolution, the effect of background, the randon fluctuations and other factors which set limits to the available measurement range are considered, and experimental results reported. Extension to very low detected intensity and to the infrared spectral range is ana lyzed and experimentally tested."
 "Since their introduction as laboratory devices about five years ago, negative electron affinity (NEA) electron emitters have found many applications for low-light-level detection. Over forty types of photomultiplier tubes with NEA materials are now available for detection of light from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. These devices provide useful photosensitivity to 1.1 micrometers. The detectors which are currently available will be reviewed, and the prospects for the near future will be discussed. A general summary of the contribution of NEA materials to low-light-level detection will be included."
"There exists an increasing demand for photomultipliers with better time resolution, higher count rate capabilities and generally faster time response. This paper discusses fundamental electron-optical considerations which determine the speed of response of electrostatically-focussed photomultipliers. The nature of time broadening is discussed with regard to geometrical and initial velocity effects at dynode surfaces. Time limitations inherent in the dynode material itself are also treated. Examples of different fast photomultiplier structures are given. A discussion of various delta-function light sources is included and the relative merits of these sources with respect to time performance, ease of use and cost is reviewed."
"Characteristics of photomultipliers having dynodes with cesium-activated gallium phosphide secondary emitting surfaces have been investigated. We present measurements of characteristics, generally not available from manufacturers data sheets, for several 8850's, C70133B's, 8852's, and C31024's. The transit-time difference, the single-electron transit-time spread, and the collection and quantum efficiency uniformity as a function of the position of the photocathode sensing area are measured and discussed. Measurement techniques and descriptions of measuring systems are given in detail. Ephasis is put on the determination of optinum photamultiplier operating conditions, particularly concerning the collection efficiency, and minimum transit-time spread."
"The design and performance of a new ceramic envelope electron multiplier are described. The tube uses hemispherically shaped 3/8\" diameter dynodes crimped into kovar cups. The dynode assemblies are alternately stacked between high-alumina ceramic rings and brazed into a rugged single piece construction envelope. The structure has an outside diameter of 0. 5 inches with an overall length of 2.75 inches and is capable of withstanding extreme environmental conditions. The tube withstands 100 g shocks for 11 msec duration, random vibration levels of 1.3 g2 /Hz, and can be operated over a temperature range from liquid N2 to 400°C. The electron optics of the discrete dynodes provide optimum interstage electron collection. The single electron pulse height distribution at gains higher than 108 is nearly Gaussian and has a FWHM of approximately 0.6. Complete data on pulse height distribution characteristics is reviewed over the dynamic range of the device. The photon sensitivity of the device will be discussed within the range of 58.3 to 150 nm as well as the adaptability for charged particle conversion below 3 keV. Fatigue characteristics are examined as a function of accumulated counts up to 1012, exposure to controlled atmospheres of dry air, noble gases, and maximum counting rates up to 10 MHz. Applications for these detectors are reviewed, including their projected use in mass spectroscopy experiments on the Apollo 17 mission."
"A rugged miniature photomultiplier has been developed which is only 8 mm in diameter. The electron multiplying element is a single channel multiplier. Photoelectrons from the 5 mm diameter cathode are electrostatically focused into the channel multiplier without need for a funnel or cathode-to-channel bias. This photomultiplier is a two-terminal device and uses no external resistors. The high gain characteristics (~108 at 3,000V), and the single-electron pulse height distribution (FWHM ⩽0.6), make the tube ideal for pulse-counting applications. The small diameter of this tube suggests applications in close-packed arrays and mosaics for scintillation imaging. This tube can be used as a scintillation spectum analyzer with good resolution even at high gains where there are greater than 109 anode electrons per scintillation event. The structure can also be employed in a windowless configuration as a particle or x-ray detector. In this modification apertures as large as 5 × 7 mm2 are possible. One use is as the detector in an Auger apparatus, where the high-gain output pulses allow precision digital data handling techniques and long drift-free integration time."
 "A review is given of the properties of parallel plate electron multipliers and present development work is described. In particular the type of multiplier fabricated by RF-sputtering of separate potential divider and secondary emission layers is discussed. This allows optimization of the two functions. Typical plate dimensions are 2O×2O mm, with a separation of 4326706 0.3 mm. The theories for the straight pipe-shaped multiplier and the parallel plate multipliers are discussed and a comparison is made with measurements, The influence of the geometry is discussed, including optimum plate spacing. A difference compared with tubular multipliers is that electron avalanches spread sideways, because of statistics and electric repulsion effects. Studies of pulse shapes and timing properties are reported. Current pulses at the oultput are about 10 nsec long, for each electron avalanche, Severlal superimposed avalanches caused by ionic feedback build up the integrated voltage pulse to a length of a few tenths of a μsec."
"Scintillating phosphors intimately mixed with long lived radionuclides are used to construct stable reference lights for many measurement applications. If phosphors having long lived traps are used in the construction of such lights the temperature dependence of light emission may be a complicated function of the temperature history of the reference light. The transient temperature dependence has been calculated for several traps ranging in depth from 0.5 to 1.5 ev. Experimental data are presented for Harshaw TLD-100, CaF2: Mn, CaF2: Dy, ZnS, and NaI(Tl). The calculations and measurements show that phosphors should be chosen which have either very deep traps not likely to produce light at normal operating temperatures or those which have shallow traps likely to equilibrate in a short time."
"This paper reports on the possibilities for locating light events randomly distributed in a plane by using only one photomultiplier with original electron optics. This experimental 2 inch phototube designed at LEP allows a spatial and temporal control of the electron emission from small elements of the photocathode. The originality of the tube lies in the use of a cross bar control grid embedded in the glass of the window at a short distance (d = 1 mm) from the photosensitive layer. The amplitude of the anode signal obtained in response to a light flash is dependent on the electrical voltage applied to the X or Y wire of the grid associated with the excited element of the photocathode. In such a way it has been shown that the position of a point light source scanning the photocathode plane of the PM could be determined with a resolution of 5 mm. Some results obtained by using a coding process to supply the blocking electrical pulses are given."
"A study of the 56 AVP photomultiplier has shown that the single electron response amplitude spectrum depends on the wave length of the detected photons. In fact, for 6700 A light a high quality spectrum i.e. presenting a strong maximum, may be obtained by applying well chosen voltages to the first dynode and by using the positive focusing bias recommended by the manufacturer. A continuous degradation of the spectrum is observed when the wavelength decreases from 6700 Å to 3100 Å; for blue light there is no maximum anymore. It was found that for an illumination of the central area of the photocathode, the spectra for blue light may be markedly improved by running the focusing electrode at a negative bias with respect the photocathode. Results concerning peak to valley type figures of merit of the spectra are shown vs. focusing voltage and for various wavelengths the implications of these observations are discussed. It seems that these phenomena are not specific of the 56 AVP as analogous results were observed on the recent 2106 phototube."
"A systematic study of nitrogen luminescence decay time has been performed, exciting nitrogen by α particles in various oxygen mixtures and air near atmospheric pressure. Results obtained by varying the oxygen ratio from 0 to 20% and total pressure from 200 to 2000 torr are given and explained by kinetic theory of the phenomena. It seems that a resonance collision process is responsible for the changes in the decay times of the second positive nitrogen group. An extrapolation of the measurements gives a decay time of 0.52 ns for air at atmospheric pressure. We proposed to study the luminescence decay time of air excited by the alpha particles of Polonium 210, in a pressure range between 200 and 2000 torr. As is known, nitrogen is mainly responsible for the luminescence of air irrespective of the excitation method; the most intense bands emitted correspond to transitions of the second positive system of the N2 molecule arn the first negative system of the once ionised molecule N2+5. Between 220 and 600 nm, the spectral domain of our experiments, the presence of oxygen is shown by a strong inhibition of the intensity of the nitrogen bands and by the appearance of the auroral line OI at 557.7 nm line, whose intensity is always very small. We therefore compared the luminescence decay time of the air and that of a mixture containing 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen."
"The influence of transit time differences due to the photocathode geometry and the influence of non-uniformity of photoelectric yield and collection efficiency of optical input system, on photomultipliers time resolution, were investigated. The calculation of transit time differences contribution were performed and the theoritical results were compared with the experimental measurements results."
  "Studies have been made of the performance of a large sample of the new heavy scintillator TlCl(Be,I) as a total absorption shower cascade (TASC) detector for high energy electrons and gamma rays. The observed energy resolution for electrons in the range 0.1 to 15 GeV is reported and compared to a Monte Carlo calculation of expected fluctuations in energy leakage from the crystal volume. The performance of this new scintillator and its potential applications are discussed."
"Studies of scintillation TlCl(I,Be) crystals have been conducted using 8-GeV negative pions and 50- to 130-MeV positrons. Pulse shapes and resolutions of these crystals have been measured. Pulses from TlCl(I,Be) are observed to have a fast rise time (≤2 nsec) and a complicated decay scheme consisting of at least three separate components. Attempts were also made to observe the Cerenkov radiation from these crystals due to highly relativistic particles. The resolution of the pulse height spectrum for a 2.9-cm diameter by 3.8-cm length TlCl(I,Be) scintillator was measured for 8-GeV negative pions. For comparison, the resolution of the same size CsI(Tl) scintillator was measured using the same experimental configuration. The resolution of CsI(Tl) is only slightly greater than theoretical prediction. The resolution of TlCl(I,Be) is greater, being limited by photon statistics even for 35 MeV of deposited energy. The resolution of a 7.6-cm diameter by 7.6-cm length TlCl(I,Be) crystal used as a Total Absorption Shower Counter for 50-130 MeV positrons has also been measured. This resolution is in reasonable agreement with previously reported data."
"A multiwire chamber using a gas mixture of argon, isobutane and ∝-trichlorethane-1, 1, 1 (CH3.CCl3) has been successfully operated. Although this chamber does not operate in the proportional mode (i.e., pulse height is not a linear function of the primary ionization) we feel it has a substantial advantage over conventional proportional chambers especially when it is used to detect high energy particles. We call these detectors wire counters; their unique feature is in the use of a highly electronegative substance, (CH3.CCl3), to limit the electron avalanche. These counters with wire spacing of 1 mm can provide gas multiplication factors between 105 to 107 without going into spark formation or breakdown. Their detection efficiency approaches 100% with large high voltage plateaus. We have obtained a time resolution of ± 6 nsec at FWHM from pulses with rise times between 6-10 nsec."
"Delay lines have been shown to offer many advantages for multi-wire proportional chamber readout, particularly in applications involving single event counting. It is desirable to optimize the delay line with respect to cost, mechanical convenience, linearity, and risetime. We have constructed several types of tapped delay lines and have tested them with a 20 × 20 cm proportional chamber. A delay line constructed of 100 1 meter lengths of RG-316/U miniature coaxial cable offers excellent linearity (< .2%), a rise time of 30 nsec, and total delay of 500 nsec. Printed circuit delay lines, with characteristics similar to the coaxial lines were constructed, and offer greatly improved packaging properties at a cost of less than $ 1 per wire."
 "An improved Cerenkov counter for the High Energy Cosmic Ray Experiment on the first High Energy Astronomy Observatory will make the resolution between different nuclei much better. A more UV reflecting paint and improved radiator and PMT positioning should give us hoped for results."
"A gas-filled proportional counter camera that images photon emitting sources was built and tested. This camera measures and displays the impact location of individual photons in an energy range between 1 and 150 keV and permits pulse shape and energy discrimination for background reduction. Possible fields of applications for this camera include nuclear medicine, nuclear physics, x-ray diffraction, and related areas. The signal processing of the camera is based on further improvements and simplifications of the risetime method as applied to multiwire position-sensitive counters. Materials inside the counter were selected so that the camera can be used over long periods of time without purification of the counter gas. The sensitive area of the camera is 200 × 200 mm2, and the size of each picture element is 1 × 1 mm2; thus 40,000 picture elements are resolved. Counting rates of up to 20,000 photons/s do not appreciably affect the spatial resolution. The camera has been tested only with low energy photons (<30 keV) to determine the properties and applicability of the camera; however, by use of high pressure (>10 atm) Xe counter gas, a useful detection efficiency (>30%) and good spatial resolution are expected for 150-keV photons."
"We describe a xenon-filled multi-wire proportional chamber (MWPC) with delay-line readout of coordinates for nuclear medicine applications. This system, with an active area of 30.5 × 30.5 cm2, is being used to image internally administered radioisotope distributions in animals for research purposes."
"In the interest of minimizing patient irradiation, while maximizing diagnostic image quality, it is desirable to utilize all of the radiation emerging from the patient. For optimum utilization, it appears to be necessary to allow photons with different energies to contribute to the image with different weights. Optimum weights have been determined for the most common case of noise-limited images, where it is assumed that the weights should be chosen so as to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. For less noisy images, sharpening may be achieved by assigning negative weights to scattered photons; that is, by scatter subtraction. In general, image formation with multiple weighted channels provides a greater degree of flexibility than is possible with a single channel."
 "A review of the workings of charge coupled devices is given with the intention of bringing out the essential features and characteristics essential to understanding their capabilities and limitations as analog shift registers and imaging devices. While attention is focused on three phase devices, some attention is given to two and four phase devices as well as the bucket brigade devices. The special advantages of these devices as compared to existing imaging devices is discussed."
"By utilizing the secondary electrons which are produced when an energetic charged particle enters a semiconductor particle detector, it has been found feasible to obtain two dimensional information on particle position without compromising the energy resolution of the particle detector. The low energy secondary electrons are transferred with spatial fidelity from their point of origin on the entrance face of the particle detector to an electron multiplier array (Bendix micro-channel plate) by means of a uniform magnetic field. The position of the output charge from the array is derived from signals in a resistive collector plate."
"A multicrystal positron camera designed for use with radionuclides produced with a medical cyclotron is described. The camera uses coincidence techniques for collimation by detecting the positron annihilation radiation. Typical radionuclides are 11C, 13N, 15O with half lives of 20, 10, and 2 minutes, respectively. The principal object of the design is to achieve a data rate capacity to 5 × 104 coincidence events per second, as well as high sensitivity and resolution. This will allow time sequential images of fractional second duration. Each of the camera's two identical detectors consist of a planar array of 127 small NaI(Tl) crystals viewed by an array of 72 phototubes. Timing signals are derived from the phototubes and are subsequently used to identify 2549 crystal pairs. The coincidence data is stored in a magnetic-core memory and used for a local data display; alternatively data may be transferred under program control to a PDP-9 computer. The sensitive field area is 27 cm × 30 cm and the spatial resolution is less than 1 cm at the midplane. The camera is currently being used for a number of clinical applications."
"The increasing availability of short lived gamma and positron emitting isotopes, coupled with the importance of dynamical studies and better imaging, has generated the need for an improved γ-ray camera. We discuss a new type of γ-ray camera which makes use of electron avalanches in liquid xenon. A configuration currently under development is shown in Fig. 1. The successful operation of a liquid xenon proportional counter was recently reported. The liquid xenon camera promises better spatial resolution and higher counting rate than the existing NaI (Tl) scintillation camera. The spatial resolution for γ rays is in principle limited only by the range of photoelectrons in liquid xenon, which is < 0. 2 mm for energies < 1 MeV. A counting rate of 106 C/s or more appears possible. As a result of the better resolution and high counting rate capability, the definition of the picture is improved. In addition, the high counting rate capability makes possible dynamic studies which were previously unfeasible. Although we expect the energy resolution with liquid xenon to be superior to that of NaI (see next section), our preliminary measurements show 17% FWHM for 279 keV γ's. Improvements are expected by using better geometry and smoother wire."
 "A γ-ray camera utilizing a position sensitive coaxial Ge(Li) detector is being developed. Slots parallel to the detector axis are machined in the outer n-layer contact of the crystal to produce effectively independent pie-shaped sectors. The sector preamplifier-discriminator that is activated by a γ-ray interaction in the detector specifies the angular position of the interaction. The radial location of the interaction is determined by pulse-shape analysis of the signal from the common broadband low-noise preamplifier connected to the p-core. Thus, with an appropriate collimator the spatial distribution of radiation intensities is determined in polar co-ordinates . Position signals corresponding to one or more selected γ-ray energies are stored in a small computer which transforms the polar co-ordinates into cartesian coordinates and displays the image on an X-Y oscilloscope. Data pertaining to the position response of the detector and to regional variations in detector efficiency are presented."
"A catheter semiconductor radiation detector (CASRAD) probe which can be placed safely inside a human body for the measurement of beta-ray activity was developed. To fulfill specific requirements arising from medical purposes, the detector element of the CASRAD probe is made by a silicon p-n junction diode of single-ended coaxial structure, 2.3 mm in diameter and 1-4 mm long. Difficulties of electronic noise caused by vibration of a long cable approximately 120 cm in length was solved by using a subminiature noiseless coaxial cable. The overall noise level of the CASRAD probe at 20 V bias and 40°C is less than about 40 keV beta rays equivalent. Therefore, the probe can be used to detect beta rays from 14C, 85Kr, 32P etc., provided window thickness of the probe is chosen properly. The beta-ray sensitivity of a CASRAD probe type TCK-2 is about 5,000 cpm/μCi/ml of 32P solution. The CASRAD probe type TCK-2 has been used to hemodynamic studies including measurement of circulation time, detection of left-to-right intracardiac shunt, continuous measurement of cardiac output and measurement of coronary blood flow. Pulmonary function also has been studied by using a CASRAD probe with a collimator and 85Kr as an indicator. Malignancies of various organs such as the esophagus, stomach, lung , uterus and breast have been diagnosed by means of 32P and the CASRAD probe."
"There are biochemical reasons to attribute a physiological importance to selenium compounds in the constituents of the eye. This could justify a clinical application of 75-Selenium in ophthalmology. Good accuracy and relatively simple technique can be achieved with the aid of a miniature probe capable of working at room temperature and reasonably sensitive to gamma rays in the 100-300 keV region. We have compared the performance of a commercial Si(Li) and an experimental CdTe probe, for the detection of 75-Selenium . A solution of 75-Se sodium selenite was applied dropwise onto the eye and its disappearance rate was then measured with both the Si(Li) and CdTe probes. Because of the low atomic number of silicon, it was not possible to obtain significant results with the Si(Li) probe. On the other hand, the CdTe probe yielded a counting rate sufficiently high to obtain a measurement of the disappearance rate,even with low level activities, in the range of the amounts applicable in clinical diagnosis. Moreover, the higher photoelectric efficiency of the CdTe probe lends itself to the identification and measurement of two or more gamma emitting radionuclides applied simultaneously."
"An analysis of the conflicting parameters for the optimum design of an invivo semiconductor detector and invivo microminiature preamplifier has been made. Two forms of each have been developed for use in many medical and biological applications: One, a bullet shaped probe which permits shielding of the voltage-signal lead and operation at ground potential of all exposed surfaces; devices of 7 mm down to 3mm diameter have been made. Two, plane parallel devices which must be used when the application demands that one or more dimensions must be in the range of 1mm. The preamplifiers have dimensions of 1 mm diameter and 5 mm length and 3 mm diameter and 7 mm length. The physical and nuelear characteristics of each are presented with results of their application."
"The progress of hemodialysis is monitored by selecting a glomerular substance, such as DTPA, that is removed by the artificial kidney at a realistic rate and labelling it with a radioisotope, preferably Tc99m, that gives a low patient radiation dose and is easy to measure. The Tc99m-DTPA is injected intravenously and allowed to equilibrate in the patient. Hemodialysis is then started with a conventional dialyzer. The isotope concentration is measured with a simple scintillation counter, 3 or 4 turns of the bloodfilled plastic tubing between the patient and dialyzer being wrapped around the detector crystal. The counting rate is a measure of the fraction of Tc99m-DTPA remaining in the patient. The drop in counting rate due to the radioactive decay of the isotope is automatically compensated by a novel ratemeter whose sensitivity increases with time at the appropriate exponential rate. Its output indicator is set to 100% at the start of dialysis and decreases as the isotope is removed, being about 35% after 6 hours. By watching the meter the dialysis may be terminated at any desired level. Thirteen patients have been studied with good results. This technique is simple to use and presents no contamination or radiation hazard to the patient. It has potential clinical application for hospital and home dialysis of patients with chronic kidney failure."
"Probes have been fabricated from semiinsulating CdTe and their efficiency for photoevents compared with silicon devices of similar active volumes (≈6 mm3). CdTe probes were found to be 150 times more efficient to 122 keV photons and about an order of magnitude more efficient for 60 keV x-rays. The resolution (FWHM) for probes was limited to ≈15 keV by cable capacitance at lower photon energies and at higher energies by the escape of the photoelectron from the active volume. For uncapsulated devices of comparable active volumes 8 keV and 10 keV resolution was obtained for 24lAm and 57Co. For 50 mm3 devices, resolutions of 5% were obtained for 137Cs and 60Co and peak to total ratios were comparable to (137Cs) and smaller than (60Co) the ratio of the photoelectric to total absorption coefficients. The photoelectric absorption coefficient was measured for CdTe at 122 keV and found to be 5.4 ± 0.4 cm-1. Theoretical spectra were computed and were only in qualitative agreement with experimental results."
"Crystals of HgI2 (Eg = 2.1 eV) have been operated as conductign type Ω-ray spectrometers at room temperature. Two-carrier collection is observed and collection of the electrons is sufficiently good to give full energy peaks for γ-rays of energies below 100 keV. A resolution of 10 keV FWHM was observed for the 18 keV X-ray from 241Am Room temperature spectroscopy in the energy region < 100 keV is possible due to the high stopping power of HgI2 (Z = 80, 53) and the low dark conductivity {~10-13(Ω. cm)-1). With the present material the mobility-lifetime product is 10-5 to 10-4 cm2/V for electrons and is 10-6 to 105 cm2/V for holes."
"Germanium crystals grown in wet H2 from material that contains trace amounts of silicon exhibit \"smooth pits\" in addition to familiar dislocation pits seen on etched surfaces. Such material appears normal by the usual methods of electrical evaluation, but detectors fabricated from it invariably exhibit severe trapping. Experiments yielding information about the presence of oxygen and silicon in germanium are reported. Preliminary observations indicate that a test for the presence of smooth pits may also provide a critical means for evaluating Li drift material. Examination of a sample of \"good\" Li drift germanium showed it to be free of these pits, whereas a sample described as, \"Drifts normally, but detectors show severe hole trapping.\" was found to have 700/cm2 smooth pits."
"Evaluation of high-purity germanium exhibiting acceptor concentrations in the 109 to 1010/cm3 range taxes normal methods of measuring semiconductor material parameters. It has proven difficult to obtain unambiguous measurements by the Hall Effect or conductivity methods. We show that pulse measurements on guard-ring radiation detectors fabricated from high-purity germanium, when properly interpreted, can provide data on acceptor and hole concentrations as a function of temperature that supplement data obtained by Hall Effect and conductivity methods. The method, which is an extension of the technique used for detector capacity measurements, employs injection of electrical pulses via the detector into a charge-sensitive preamplifier. The shape and size of the output pulse permits determination of the characteristics of the depleted and undepleted regions of the detector; variation of the applied detector voltage allows choice of the relative thickness of the two regions. Results of measurements on two germanium crystals, over a broad temperature range, will be presented."
"Detector have been fabricated from pure germanium with a lithium diffused N+ contact, and a P+ contact which is ion implanted in a dc glow discharge in boron trifluoride. A deep groove is used to increase the breakdown voltage. Measurements of the current-voltage characteristics of these detectors after temperature cycling are reported. The correlation of smooth etch pits with severe trapping in pure germanium detectors is shown. Finally, the performance of a few large detectors is given."
"Ion implantation and glow discharge methods have been utilized to produce boron rectifying contacts on high purity N-type germanium. The behaviour of both kinds of contact are discussed with respect to the damage density and annealing as measured by electrical and backscattering properties. Ohmic contacts were obtained by phosphorus implantation, lithium diffusion and metal evaporation. The counters have been investigated with nuclear radiations (#x003B1;, ß, γ)."
"The operation of germanium spectrometers at temperatures considerably in excess of 77°K (with attendant advantages in the cooling system) has been made possible with the advent of high purity germanium. The basic limitations on operating temperature are due to (1) increased trapping effects and (2) increased electronic noise. An extensive analysis has been made of temperature-dependent noise sources. The principal limitation is due to trap and band-to-band bulk-generated currents. Experimentally determined parameters for germanium indicate that the operation of larger-volume detectors at temperatures in excess of 200°K is feasible. Several high purity detectors (1 cm3 and 14 cm3 in volume) have already been operated satisfactorily in the 170-180°K range, considerably higher than the 130-140°K maximum range observed for Ge(Li) detectors. In all detectors tested thus far, the principal limitation has been due to trap-generated current, which indicates the possibility of further improvement."
"Specially grown P-type Ge crystals containing controlled quantities of various deep-level impurities have been studied. Measurements of the dependence of the recombination lifetimes on temperature in the P-type samples were used to determine the level position and the capture cross-section of the impurities. The trap parameters in N-I-P diodes were determined using a collimated beam of γ-rays. Results are given for the following impurities: Ag, Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr, Te, Fe, Co and Pt. These impurities were examined in crystals with and without dislocations."
 "The improved infrared response (IRR) technique has been used to qualitatively compare radiation effects on Si(Li) detectors with energy levels reported for silicon in the literature. Measurements have been made on five commercial silicon detectors and one fabricated in-house, both before and after irradiation with fast neutrons, l.9-MeV protons, and 1.6-MeV electrons. Effects dependent upon the extent of radiation damage have been observed. It seems likely that the photo-EMF, or photovoltage, effect is the basic mechanism for the observation of IRR in p-i-n diodes with a wide i-region. Experimental characteristics of the IRR measurement are in agreement with those of the photovoltage effect."
"Two undesirable features exhibited by gold surface barrier detectors from liquid phase epitaxial (LPE) n-GaAs are the variation in pulse height response with bias and multi-peaking effects near full depletion. Capacitative attenuation by the high resistivity epitaxy-substrate interface (ESI) layer is considered to be the origin of these effects. Such anomalous interface layers are well known in the application of LPE GaAs to Gunn oscillator devices and a review of their properties is presented. The response of detectors at room temperature when subjected to IR illumination was markedly improved in the multi-peaking region and slow components in the pulse rise time were removed. The presence of a deep level acceptor in the ESI layer 0.31 - 0.76 eV from the valence band is inferred. Other methods for the reduction of ESI effects are discussed."
"Gallium arsenide surface barrier diodes have been fabricated from high purity level materials. These devices have an Au surface barrier having a depletion layer thickness of from 70μmto 1 mm and an area of from 3mm2-27mm2. These devices have been operated as α-particles, / ß-ray, and γ-ray spectrometers and detectors. The best energy resolutions taken with a GaAs detector made from liquid phase epitaxial GaAs wafer were 20keV (fwhm) and 8 keV for 5.486 MeV α-particles from 241Am and 115 keV conversion electrons from 57Co at room temperature, respectively. For room temperature applications, a simple charge sensitive preamplifier was constructed using two FETs and one OP amp. The combination of a encapsulated GaAs detector and two small semiconductor thermoelements (electrical cooling device) was studied to make a simple X-or γ-ray spectrometer. A special tiny GaAs detector was also fabricated as in vivo ß-ray counting detector in biomedical applications. The energy per electron-hole pair (ϵ) in GaAs was measured at 4.35 + 0.02 eV for α-particles with a linear variation with bandgap energy (Eg) of 2.53 over a temperature range of 1950°K to 330°K, and 4.57 eV for conversion electrons (115keV) at 300°K, respectively. The ϵ vs Eg relationship was also investigated for Ge, Si, GaAs and CdTe using experimental values and led to ϵ = 2. 596 Eg + 0.714 (eV) with correlation coefficient of 0.999 at 300°K. The related problems for intrinsic material constant (ϵ) are discussed for several semiconductor materials."
"The traveling heater method (THM) of growing CdTe with a tellurium solvent has been used toproduce single crystals with low carrier concentrations from which gamma-ray detectors have been fabricated. The use of Cl, Br, or I as compensating dopants in the CdTe has resulted in Mate, ial with improved μT products [(μT)n μ 4 × 10-4 cm2/V and (μT)p 8 × 10-5cm2/V]. The dopant was added to the tellurium solvent as the cadmium salt in concentrations of 100 to 500 ppm by weight of the solvent. The best results to date have been obtained with Cl. An analysis of the temperature distribution during THM shows that it is possible to obtain a flat isotherm which is necessary to propagate single crystals. Low speed rotation (1 to 5 rpm) promotes a more symmetrical thermal distribution and improwes the crystallinity of the CdTe."
"To develop a fast x-ray detector with a memory, we have performed experiments with metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (MOS-C) devices. For timeresolved recording of the x-ray pulse, a linear array of detectors is uniformly irradiated while the elements are sequentially biased at Δt time intervals; significant positive charge trapping occurs in each element of the array only during the period Δt when the high field bias is applied across the dielectric. Detection of 10-ns resolution has been recorded. Time-resolution is presently limited by the bandwidth limitation of the bias strobing method."
"The degradation of performance of lithium-compensated silicon nuclear particle detectors induced by irradiation at room temperature with 0.6-MeV and 1.5-MeV electrons, l.9-MeV protons, and \"fast\" neutrons from a plutonium-beryllium [Pu-Be] source has been investigated. In general with increasing fluence, the irradiations produced an increase of detector leakage current, noise, capacitance, and a degradation in the performance of the detector as a charged-particle energy spectrometer. Following the irradiations, annealing effects were observed when the detectors were reverse-biased at their recommended operating voltages. Upon removal of bias, a continuous degradation of detector performance characteristics occurred. Detectors which had been damaged by electrons and protons exhibited a stabilization in their characteristics within two weeks after irradiation, whereas detectors damaged by neutrons had a continuous degradation of performance over a period of several months."
"Room temperature operating X and alpha ray spectrometers have been made with gallium arsenide. Surface barrier diodes, using gold or palladium have been fabricated on high purity material grown by liquid phase epitaxy. The epitaxial layers have a thickness varying from 30 to 120 μM and an electrically active impurity concentration varying from 5.1012 to 1.1014 per cc. These layers deplete with only 8 volts reverse bias. Diodes of 4 to 8 mm2 area have given a resolution 15.5 kev FWHM on 5.48 MeV alpha particles at room temperature and 40 keV at 120°C. Similar devices have given a resolution of better than 5 keV FWHM on 60 keV X-rays at 25°C. The bulk generated currents are as low as 2.5 nanoamperes per cubic millimeter."
"Cadmium telluride single crystals have been grown by the vertical zone melting technique. Without added chemical impurities, they are generally N-type of 10-100 Ω. cm resistivity. Detectors have been prepared with this material by implanting Bi+ ions. The influence of the implant conditions and annealing treatments were studied. A FWHM of 24 keV has been obtained at 300° and 77° K for 5.5 MeV α-particles."
"The results on the resolution of radiation detectors are analyzed. It is pointed out that resolution is limited by the ho le trapping on deep centers, that compensate initial conductivity. This trapping can be lowered by the elect ric fields exceeding the values 1.2 - 1.4 kV/cm, though the decrease of the background of impurities, that are present in Ge equally to chemical donors, is more radical way. By this method one can get the detectors with resolution better than 0.2% for E γ = 662 keV γ-rays at the donor concentration 1012 cm-3 The resolution can be improved by the reduction of the inhomogeneous properties of monocrystals, that leads now to the hole life-time relief in detectors up to 100%. The possibility of obtaining stable at room temperature germanium detectors attracted the investigators for a long time. For this purpose in works the usage of method of doping n-type germanium by gamma-ray irradiation acceptor damages. Detectors, obtained by this technique (so-called radiation-type detectors) can spectrometrize gamma-ray mean energy with a resolution better than 1% at the depleted depth 5-8 mm and also are precise spectrometers short ran ge radiations: ∝, ß-particles, X-rays Recently as a result of works of Hall et al. the germanium with the presence of extraordinary low impurity concentration (~1010 cm-3) was obtained. This allows to develop the depleted depth (actually to 10 mm), without additional compensation10-12 As a result of high perfection of germanium these detectors have extremely high energy resolution."
"An analysis of the shape of the pulse-height spectrum is carried out. The se quence of the physical processes which participate in shaping signals in a detector is taken into consideration. The main attention is paid to the charge collection process and to the spread in the amplitude Co(q) due to incomplete collection. A generalized analytical expression is obtained for the quantity q and the function Co(q) for detectors of the most widely used configurations (planar, coaxial, spherical). An analysis is given of the difference in two conventional approaches 6,8 to the problem of calculating the total pulse-height spectrum shape. It is noted that under ordinary conditions of gamma spectrometry the spectrum undergoes essential symmetrization due to multiple scattering (Compton scattering with subsequent photoabsorption). This brings the results of calculations outlined in refs. 6,8 closer to one another. However, in a single-step interaction (resulting, for instance, in the double escape peak) simple summation of dispersions for the spectrum components in 6 would lead to considerable errors. The scheme outlined in 8,12 is shown to permit using a pulse-heght analyzer in calculations of the spectrum shape. Presented in the Appendix are the results of an experiment showing that the signal across the detector electrodes is connected with potential differences traversed: Δq~Δv/v This relationship was used to calculate the charge q and the spectrum Co(q)."
"The generally accepted belief in constant fullenergy peak efficiency for coaxial germanium gamma ray detectors maintained at liquid nitrogen temperature has been found to be invalid in many cases. A majority of the available raw germanium ingots possess a shortcoming which causes detectors to decline in efficiency with time, if the standard techniques described in the literature have been employed for their production. A strong correlation of efficiency instability with ingot has been established. The time rate of change varies markedly from ingot to ingot. Over 60% of the ingots studied resulted in detectors whose efficiencies declined at rates greater than 8% per year. A substantial fraction of the cases studied displayed relative decreases of 10-20% in a period of six months. Declines of as much as 10-25% in several weeks were also observed."
"The effective application of Si(Li) semiconductor X-ray detectors to the elemental analysis of trace impurities in environmental and biological specimens has required the improvement of existing systems. The use of low-background X-ray tubes for fluorescence excitation and the increased counting rate capability of the electronics have reduced counting times necessary for analysis. The presence of radiation-induced low-energy background in conventional detectors has been shown to be a major limiting factor in the detection sensitivity for trace element constituents in organic specimens. The use of guard-ring detector geometries has eliminated the cause of much of this background, and has reduced detection limits by approximately an order of magnitude. The practical detection of 0.1 ppm concentration achieved with these techniques has made energydispersive X-ray fluorescence a potent tool for the analysis of environmental and biological samples. A few examples have been chosen to emphasize particular advantages of the technique relative to alternative analytical methods. Examples include trace element determination in blood, air pollution particulate analysis, and studies of the influence of environment on the trace constituents of biological specimens."
"We describe the application of pulsed X-ray excitation to X-ray fluorescence spectrometry as a method for increasing the output counting rate of the system by a substantial factor. Using a pulsed X-ray tube that is immediately turned off when a signal is detected, and held off during the pulse processing time, it is possible to eliminate the need for a pulse pile-up rejection. We have achieved output counting rates significantly greater than with conventional operation for equivalent shaping networks. No significant degradation in spectrometer resolution was observed at the increased counting rates."
"Space charge influences on fields and charge collection properties in the high purity germanium coaxial and planar detectors are studied on the basis of the experimental results obtained by previous studies. Several different impurity charge densities (NA - ND = = 109 ~1011 cm-3) have been considered with a non-constant high field mobility which has been obtained by averaging the values obtained by several different investigators. A comparison with the lithium-drifted devices is given and a discussion relevant to the timing is presented."
"A timing system for coincidence and nuclear lifetime measurements with Ge(Li)-detectors is described. The timing discriminator, based on the ARC-principle, is designed using integrated circuits. Uncompensated pulses from low energy events near the threshold of the timing discriminator are eliminated by a special internal coincidence circuit. Output pulses caused by noise, are excluded by duration discrimination. The detector signals are amplified by a preamplifier and a fast amplifier with 2.5 and 3.5 nsec risetimes,respectively. The time resolution has been obtained 15.6 , 2.7 and 1.1 nsec FWHM for energies 50, 511 and 1330 keV, respectively, by using of a planar detector (1.9 cm3) with a charge collection time of 40 nsec. The differential peak shift in a range from 10 to 1330 keV was 1.2 nsec."
"In high flux density ionizing photon fields, it is usually difficult to measure photon spectra with Ge(Li) or Si(Li) semiconductor radiation detectors. A method which is an extension of that reported by Unsworth and Greening has been developed to sample scattered photons from a photon beam. A thin sheet of low atomic number material is placed in the photon beam and is observed by a collimated detector from some convenient angle, θ, away from the beam direction. Only a small fraction of the photons are scattered into the solid angle of the detector. An approximation of the energy spectrum of the primary beam may be obtained by calculating the primary photon energies from the measured scattered photon energy spectrum. This method differs from that of Unsworth and Greening by considering Compton and Rayleigh scattering separately."
"A low-noise charge sensitive preamplifier employing charge restoration after each detector pulse is described. Charge restoration is performed for each pulse by exposing the input FET to an optical flash (produced by a GaAs diode) proportional to the amplitude of the main amplifier output pulse. Special care has been taken to eliminate temperature and linearity problems of the GaAs diode. This preamplifier is capable of operating at very high \"energy rates\", e.q. for 5 MeV radiation at more than 100,000 cps."
"For fast precision time measurements with scintillation detectors zero, crossing synchronisation and fast energy selection on the current pulses from the detector seem in many cases to be the best choice. A fast S.C.A. has been developed giving both a zero crossing and a leading edge output for timing purposes. Input pulses are analyzed from 4 to 400 mA. The total time slewing of the zero crossing output is about 150 ps over the whole range of input amplitudes. Particular care has been devoted to the logic of the instrument, assuming always correct time information being carried by the output pulses. Measurements, performed with scintillation detectors, gave a best resolution of 190 ps using on both channels the zero crossing output and narrow energy selection. Good results have been obtained also with very wide energy selection."
"A data-gathering system has been developed for studying the properties of underwater light and bioluminescence. The photodetector output is used to generate a count-rate distribution that is characteristic of the light being observed. Proper analysis of this distribution reveals the presence of bioluminescence and greatly enhances the signal-detection capabilities of the system. Results of sea operations off Santa Barbara, California, are presented."
"A proportional counter hodoscope is being developed for measuring particle trajectories in high energy cosmic ray experiments. A significant advantage of proportional counters compared to spark chambers is the inherent ability to measure the trajectory of the heavy primary cosmic rays (2 < Z) in the presence of the copious knock-on electrons and delta rays produced by them. To utilize this advantage, a bi-level discrimination system has been developed based upon a preamplifier-dual discriminator unit which uses the low-level discriminator to sense all particles and the high-level discriminator to sense only heavy particles. The charge sensitive preamplifier-dual discriminatorstorage units which are packaged in hybrid thick film form for the hodoscope consume less than 4 milliwatts of power and weigh only 9 grams."
"The resolution of the NBS high resolution electron spectrometer has been improved recently by installing a new 48 channel detector array at its focal plane, in place of the original channel array that has been in use for some time. This has necessitated the design and construction of a new electronics system to accommodate the increased amount of information from the detectors. The new detector system digitally processes the signals from the detectors after amplification and discrimination. It is coupled on line to a computer which accumulates and manipulates the processed data. An effective and economical solution has been found for the construction of a large logic network for nuclear data accumulation. The functions provided are those normally found only in modular from; e.g. coincidence, with the necessary time resolution. Time differences for simultaneous signal paths have been restricted to ±1 ns maximun with a minimum pulse width of 5 ns for any pulse input. The entire system is dc coupled and the pulse pair resolution, measured during construction, is 10 ns."
"Reliable, accurate and rapid nondestructive assay instrumentation is playing an increasingly important role in the practical implementation of nuclear material safeguards, inspection and surveillance as well as in quality control and operational safety in all types of nuclear processing facilities. The neutron coincidence counting technique has been successfully demonstrated for nondestructive assay of samples containing Pu or U. The technique involves detecting neutrons from the spontaneous fission of 240Pu and 238U with polyethylene moderated neutron coincidence counters containing 3He- or BF3-filled detectors surrounding the sample to be assayed. The coincidence counting technique is necessary for reliable assay since total neutron count rate is dependent not only on the amount of Pu in the sample but also on the chemical composition. For example, if the sample contains PuO2 the total neutron production rate would be ~100 n/sec-g; however, if the sample contained PuF4 the total rate would be ~300 times larger than this. The spontaneous fission rate of both samples would be ~25 fiss/sec-g (for 5% 240Pu isotopic composition), independent of chemical composition. By using the coincidence counting technique it is possible to distinguish spontaneous fission neutrons from the randomly produced (α ,n) neutrons. Thus coincidence counting provides a powerful method for rapid and accurate assay of Pu-bearing samples. Recently, the use of fast plastic scintillation detectors has significantly extended the range of usefulness of the coincidence counting technique to materials with extremely high (α ,n) activities."
"A digital multiplexing system for monitoring radiation levels adjacent to approximately eight (8) miles of beam line with over 500 detectors is being implemented at NAL. Data from individual detectors is collected in a central area via a dedicated-time-slot digital multiplexing system, designed for high reliability rather than high bit rates, and is completely independent of any accelerator control system. Data processing is performed in a hardwired core memory system, and record keeping is accomplished via a link to the Accelerator Control Computer. A wide variety of oscilloscope displays are available for selective intensification of data."
"Nuclear reaction problems involving neutron diffusion and fission may be readily characterized by active transmission lines. This letter briefly describes the neutron diffusion and dission analog. Introductio"
"A general discussion of the scientific importance and status of stellar x-ray polarimetry is presented. A stellar x-ray polarimeter designed to fit into the bottom half of the NASA Orbiting Solar Observatory-I (OSO-I) wheel compartment or other similar spacecraft is described. In this design, the linear polarization is obtained as a function of energy. The sensitivity of the polarimeter in the 4 - 24 keV energy range was optimized with the aid of a Monte Carlo simulation computer program and is given for several important celestial x-ray sources. Estimates of sensitivity thresholds for a much larger polarimeter, suitable for flight in the NASA High-Energy Astronomy Observatory (HEAO), are also given. The minimum detectable polarization for several x-ray sources is given. For example, the minimum detectable polarization at the 99% confidence level for the Crab nebula in a 24-h observation time is 1.4% for an OSO polarimeter in a compartment (50 × 30 × 30) cm and 0.27% for a HEAO polarimeter in a compartment (100 × 100 × 30) cm. These satellite experiments are feasible and will yield significant polarization results which will have an important bearing on our understanding of x-ray source mechanisms."
"Annealing of neutron damage has been studied in n-channel, epitaxial silicon JFET's. This study includes measurements of the parameters, gmsat, IDSS, and VPO in devices with various phosphorous concentrations in the channel region. The recovery in device parameters during isochronal annealing exhibits a significant dependence on both the exposure fluence and the phosphorous concentration. The fluence dependence is due to the non-linear relationship between device parameters and defect concentration. The dependence on the phosphorous concentration is thought to be caused by E-center formation and break-up during neutron damage reordering. The recovery observed in the JFET's during annealing occurs at temperatures which are commonly reached during normal operation of power devices. Hence, significant self-healing of damage may occur during operation of such devices."
"A simple and efficient transistorized pulser for pulsing the r.f. power supplied to ion sources is described. The pulsing transistor is off during tho quiescent period and no pulse transformers are used. Accurately timed r.f. pulses of 600W peak power are obtained and the pulser consumes about W. Pulse durations in the range 1 μsec - 10 msec at duty cycles of up to 0.5 are achieved. Time jitter is less than 10 nsec and can be reduced to 1 nsec by using stabilized supply voltages. This is the first time in which transistors are used in pulsing such high power r.f. ion sources with reasonably high timing accuracy. Criteria for switching the highest r.f. power from a given pulser are given."

 "X-ray fluorescent screens consisting of a powder embedded in a silicone resin matrix and deposited on an aluminum plate have been prepared with the phosphors Gd2O2S:Tb and (ZnCd)S:Ag(P-20) at a series of different screen thicknesses. The x-ray conversion efficiency of the screens was measured using both radioisotopes and a dental radiography unit as x-ray sources. To simulate screen performance in an x-ray image intensifier tube, the screens were optically coupled to the photomultiplier which served as the detector. We found that Gd2O2S:Tb screens were substantially superior to P-20 screens in both x-ray conversion efficiency and x-ray energy absorption efficiency. Experimental screen efficiencies agree with those derived from theory by an analysis in which the efficiency of the conversion of absorbed x-ray energy to light is assumed equal to the energy efficiency of the phosphor under cathode ray excitation and optical parameters of the screens are used to estimate the efficiency with which the generated light is transmitted to the detector."
"The average energy expended to create an electron-hole pair in silicon εSi(T) has been measured in the 5-320°K temperature range with thin totally depleted surface barrier and diffused junction radiation detectors. The data have been normalized to a value of εSi (300°K) = 3.62 eV. A dependence of εSi on T much weaker than previously published by other authors has been observed. In the examined temperature range (5-320°K) our data are well fitted by εsi(T) = 2.15 Eg(T) + 1.21 eV where Eg(T) (in eV) is the value of the forbidden bandgap."
"Spark gap overvoltages of fast Marx generators in the 100-300 kv range were studied as a function of stray and interstage capacitance for several circuit designs. Overvoltage measurements were made at low voltages by simulating the spark with a silicon-controlled rectifier. Breakdown times were measured to nanoseconds by viewing the light flash from the sparks with a fast photomultiplier. The influence of the ultraviolet irradiation on breakdown time was studied by masking the first gap. Practical conclusions for Marx generator design are presented."

 "X-band Gunn diode amplifiers have been tested while exposed to pulsed ionizing radiation. Peak photo currents induced vary as the .65 power of the dose rate, as had been found for oscillator diodes. The principal effect is a transient loss of gain, with the recovery time less than 400 ns for dose rates up to 5×1010 rad (Si)/s. The dependence of gain on dose rate agrees very well with a calculation based on the change in electric field distribution caused by radiation-induced excess carriers. A permanent failure mode was also observed at the maximum operating voltage and dose rate."
"We have measured the conductivity induced in films of polyethylene, epoxy, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyimide, and glass by x rays at dose rates between 109 and 1010 rad/sec (dose in air). The films were 0.05 to 1.25 mm thick. The x-ray spectrum peaked in the vicinity of 10 keV, and the x-ray pulse width was about 40 nsec FWHM. X-ray induced photocurrents were found to obey Ohm's law at low bias voltages (less than 1 kV). Above 1 kV, however, we observed that the peak photoconductivity signals from some of the 0.05-mm-thick materials began to increase at a slightly faster than linear rate with bias voltage. The glass samples exhibited no apparent delayed conductivity, while the other sample materials showed various amounts. The magnitude of the delayed conductivity in polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyimide depended on the electric field, an effect that is consistent with Poole-Frenkel field assisted carrier generation. We have qualitatively described the magnitude and time dependence of the conductivity signals by a simple trapping model, using reasonable values for mobility, trap density, capture cross sections and trap depths."
"A transient negative frequency change in AT-cut 125 MHz 5th overtone quartz resonators has been observed following exposure to an intense burst of x-rays. All natural, Z-growth synthetic, and swept Z-growth synthetic resonators suffer a significant initial negative frequency offset. At room temperature, the transient frequency change in natural quartz anneals in approximately ten minutes to a relatively stable negative offset. For the synthetic quartz resonators, appreciable annealing of the initial negative offset continues for a longer period, finally arriving at an offset which may be positive in the case of the Z-growth synthetic but negligibly small for swept Z-growth synthetic. The transient frequency change is attributed to a relaxation process, which anneals above 165°K (Stage I). This annealable relaxation is superposed on a more stable part (Stage II) which is removed only by heating the crystal well above room temperature. The kinetics of Stage I annealing obeys a t-2 relationship and is interpreted in terms of a one-dimensional diffusion limited annealing of uncorrelated defects. In particular, it is proposed that the annealing involves the trapping of monovalent cations, most probably H+, at substitutional aluminum sites in the crystal lattice. The activation energy governing the diffusion of the defect to the trapping center is estimated to be 0.80 ± 0.05 eV."
"This paper gives a brief review of various electronic transport processes in insulating films. The topics include a brief consideration of energy bands and the concepts of extended and localized states; the properties of traps with emphasis on Shockley-Reed theory; the space-charge limitation of currents for one-carrier injection; the bulk trap limitation of currents including hopping conduction, the Poole-Frenkel effect, and field emission from traps; and ionic conduction."
"A transient electromagnetic field problem is solved for a finite length cylindrical cavity bounded by perfectly conducting walls. The cavity is filled with a homogeneous lossy dielectric material. Analytic solutions for the relevant components of the electric and magnetic fields generated by an axially propagating current pulse are presented. Results obtained for various sample problems are discussed."
"We have developed a method for the numerical solution of the system of hyperbolic equations that arise from the study of signal propagation on a three-wire transmission line. This method solves the characteristic form of the equations by using a distinct spatial grid for each traveling wave. The resulting computer code produces calculations that are virtually free of numerical dispersion."
"The feasibility of developing nondestructive screening techniques to determine the second breakdown vulnerability of semiconductor devices at submicrosecond pulse conditions has been demonstrated. In addition, it has been shownl that second breakdown can be nondestructively initiated under certain current limiting conditions without causing degradation in device operating characteristics or device second breakdown vulnerability level to subsequent pulses of electrical energy. A low energy current impulse damage mechanism at second breakdown initiation has also been observed. The experimental investigations were performed using 1N4148 diodes fabricated with various junction areas and a fixed diffusion depth. The complete results of this work are documented in Reference 1."
"This paper presents the results of a lengthy and comprehensive investigation of semiconductor device degradation from nanosecond current pulses. Topics discussed include (1) previously published literature on pulse degradation and second breakdown, (2) experimental results obtained in several studies, (3) pulse damage recovery using several annealing techniques, (4) a model of the pulse damage, (5) possible methods of hardening against pulse degradation, and (6) a preventive measure that can be taken to eliminate pulse damage."
"Transient electrical pulses impressed upon a circuit containing semiconductors subject the semiconductors to a thermal transient. Potential burnout of the parts is of particular interest and concern. A model is presented which permits the calculation of the transient temperature throughout the semiconductor given the instantaneous power dissipation within the device. The basic technique is to mathematically partition the device by isothermal surfaces, and construct the corresponding RC circuit. Lateral dispersion of the heat (two dimensional heat flow) is included as part of the model. The model has been compared to theory and test. The model is simple and can easily be programmed as a subroutine and attached to existing TREE circuit analysis programs. This permits efficient calculations from the applied electrical pulse to the internal temperature of the semiconductor for prediction of burnout. A demonstration computer solution is shown, and the memory size and run times are given."
"Permanent radiation damage effects on the microwave properties of the alumina, sapphire, and teflon-glass substrate as employed in microstrip and stripline microwave circuits have been investigated by means of a simple bandpass resonator. No changes in the microwave properties of alumina and sapphire substrates were noted to 1.3 × 108 rads (H2O) and 2 × 1015 neutrons/cm2 (E > 10 KeV), although slight discoloration of the alumina substrates was noted for gamma fluences as low as 104 rads. Gamma irradiation produced gradual increases in the dielectric constant and loss tangent of teflon-glass substrates, but neutrons did not appear to affect the microwave properties of these substrates to levels of 2 × 1015 neutrons/cm2."
"Results are presented on generalized approaches to derive radiation-inclusive simplified models of linear and digital microcircuits. Application of the principle of superposition allows generation of a compact small-signal model of the linear microcircuit, with extension of the model to include large-signal saturation effects. The digital microcircuit model is the combination of current-voltage terminal networks with a logical decision function to represent the truth table of the device. A factor of 20 to 50 improvement in required computer time and storage was realized with the terminal models over detailed models, with no significant loss in the representation of key performance parameters or radiation vulnerability. The linear modeling technique suggests that photocompensation networks can be applied successfully at the terminals of the device."
"The Wiener theory of modeling nonlinear systems is generalized to include time varying systems. With radiation effects in integrated circuits being considered as internal time varying effects, this generalized technique can be used to model an integrated circuit in a radiation environment."
"The effort to be described had as its objective the development of new techniques to define simplified models of digital integrated circuits suitable for use with the SCEPTRE or similar computer programs. These models were required to account for normal electrical performance as well as performance in an environment of ionizing and/or neutron radiation. Techniques were established to derive models capable of representing both the radiation effects and the first order transient response of the microcircuits as system components for many different kinds of digital integrated circuits. A \"black-box\" approach was employed to achieve the desired results."
"Capability of the NET-2 circuit/system computer program in semiconductor device analysis is presented. Semiconductor devices are described in terms of lumped model networks of user-selected complexity. The basic capability is illustrated through the calculation of electrical and radiation-induced transient response of diodes and transistors. Capability of NET-2 is demonstrated by the analysis of a junction-isolated TTL gate. The TTL gate model was derived by the interconnection of detailed lumped models of each of the transistor elements. Calculated electrical switching response and photoresponse accurately simulated observed results."
"Two analytical techniques (Monte Carlo and Small Sample Theory) are described which have been used to produce a survivability function, PS(RS), for equipment subject to a radiation stress, RS. The methods have been used for permanent damage due to neutron fluence and transient upset due to ionizing radiation. The methods are illustrated using a series regulator circuit. The techniques are sufficiently general such that they are applicable to a variety of environmental stresses."
"A detailed bipolar transistor model has been developed to determine the dependence of post-irradiation electrical parameters on preirradiation electrical measurements and physical parameters. Some of the features of the model are the following: (a) Postirradiation lifetimes vary with injection level. (b) Electric fields in base and emitter regions increase the emitter efficiency and normal base transport factor. (c) Collector resistance decreases when minority carriers are injected into the collector. (d) Collector resistance decreases when the collector-base junction is reverse biased and the depletion region extends into the collector. (e) Junction doping profiles are modeled as exponential-constant. (f) Junction efficiency degrades as injection level increases. (g) Base width varies with collector-base voltage. (h) All parameters except emitter width and junction areas are determined from electrical measurements, and radiation damage constants are determined from postirradiation parameters. The radiation damage constants are utilized in calculating sensitivity parameters for preirradiation parameters to be used for neutron hardness screening. A computer program varies selected preirradiation model parameters one at a time and the resulting change in an electrical parameter of interest at a specified neutron fluence is determined. The postirradiation performance of other devices of the same type at the same operating point and irradiation level can be predicted as follows: (1) Multiply the appropriate sensitivity parameter by the normalized deviation of each screening parameter from the corresponding reference unit value: (2) add the sum of these products to unity; (3) multiply this quantity by the post-irradiation electrical parameter of the reference unit."
"Measurements of bipolar transistor delay times are extensively employed to predict neutron vulnerability. Of the various possible delay times, phase delay is most commonly measured. Although this is the simplest delay measurement to implement, the measurement circuit may be quite susceptible to extraneous signal coupling at the measurement frequency and this can cause the accuracy to be severely degraded. A technique for minimizing this delay-time error has been developed. It employs simple, preferably non-reactive, but at least known, networks in place of the transistor. From the differences between the \"delay times\" measured on these known networks, the location and magnitude of the error sources in the circuit are found. This allows one to reduce greatly the effects of the error sources on all subsequent measurements. To confirm the theory of the error-correcting technique, RC networks with known delay times were assembled on transistor headers. For a particular bridge configuration, the uncorrected delay times measured were quite frequency dependent, but this dependence was removed by adding a correction term to the delay times. The correction term is obtained from measurements on the non-reactive networks and does not at all depend on the measured RC network delay times. The effects of error-sources are particularly severe when transistors with low or moderate hfe values are measured, as when measurements are made on transistors that have been degraded by subjecting them to neutron radiation."
"An approach to neutron hardness assurance in bipolar transistors is described, based on an observed high correlation of post-irradiation, saturated current gain with pre-irradiation collector resistance. Two experiments are described in which the correlation of post-irradiation gain is determined, first, with a set of structural parameters measured on auxiliary test patterns on the same chip with the subject transistor and, second, with electrical parameters measured at the terminals of the subject device. Results of these experiments suggest the feasibility of using collector resistance as a single hardness screening parameter. Implementation of this approach requires incorporation of an auxiliary resistor structure on each transistor chip and determination of the resistor value acceptance limit for the neutron fluence of interest."
"This paper describes the need for continuously evaluating the hardness of a component supplier's production and defines a method by which this evaluation may be performed. The evaluation method, known as Supplier Data Monitoring, is described in detail and actual examples are given which demonstrate its utility as a hardness assurance tool. The Supplier Data Monitoring Program is oriented toward use on a production program for which hardness design confirmation has been performed on a previous R&D program. Its prime objective is to maintain the hardness of each production component. It is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate how monitoring supplier component data achieves this objective through early detection of adverse hardness shifts at the component level."
"The effects of operating life on the electrical and radiation effects characteristics of several high reliability discrete semiconductor device types were investigated. Approximately 2400 parts consisting of five transistor types, two regular diode types and a zener diode type with operating ages ranging from 1.6 to 5.9 years were tested in this investigation. The devices tested included representative samples of both silicon and germanium materials as well as alloy junction, mesa and planar fabrication technology. No correlation was found between operating life and the direction or magnitude of changes in either the electrical or radiation characteristics of the sample populations investigated."
"The outer-planets spacecraft must contend with a variety of radiation environments during its lengthy mission in deep space. These environments include onboard nuclear emitters, such as radio-isotope thermoelectric generators, and natural sources--Earth's Van Allen belt, galactic cosmic radiation, solar flares, and a trapped radiation belt at Jupiter. This paper shows the effects of mission and spacecraft parameters on the neutron and proton fluences that might cause permanent damage to the electronic devices from these sources. It is concluded that electronic systems will function satisfactorily during these missions provided that appropriate precautions are taken."
"An investigation of radiation damage mechanisms and the magnitude of their effects on the operating characteristics of imaging sensors utilizing a mosaic array of silicon diodes in a television pickup tube is reported. The effects produced by bombardment of bare-silicon-diode arrays or vidicon tubes with 85kV x-rays, Cobalt 60 gamma rays, 1 MeV and 11 MeV electrons, 3 MeV and 142 MeV protons, and reactor neutrons are presented. Results show that the dark (reverse bias) current of a diode array increases less than a factor of 2 if the fluence level is less than 104 rads of gamma radiation or 4 ×1011 1 MeV electrons/cm2. For these same dose levels, the quantum efficiency increases rather than decreases. Continued bombardment in excess of these fluences decreases the quantum efficiency and increases the dark current. Electrons of 11 MeV were more damaging than 1 MeV electrons by a factor of 10 to 20 while protons of 3 MeV more effectively produced dark current increases and quantum efficiency degradation in silicon diode arrays than 1 MeV electrons by a factor of 105 in fluence. Protons of 142 MeV were less effective than 3 MeV protons in producing the same effects by a factor of 102 in fluence. Measurements of these degradation effects at 217 K indicated that the dark current is reduced by a factor of 200 to 500 relative to room-temperature values."
 "Total high energy electron backscatter yields and low energy secondary electron yields have been measured for aluminum, copper and tantalum. Primary high energy electrons were incident at angles of 0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 75° from the surface normal. A new experimental measuring apparatus has been developed and tested to measure total electron yields from irradiated materials. This device is relatively free of the problems associated with electron emission from the device itself."
"Absolute electron yields from tantalum, molybdenum, copper and aluminum have been measured for several x-ray bombarding geometries. The photon spectra used were derived from filtered bremsstrahlung generated in a tungsten anode at 50 KV, constant potential. The electron spectra were measured by a cylindrical electrostatic analyzer with a secondary emission detector. The spectra exhibit both Auger and scattered photoelectrons."
"Corrections to the Landau-Vavilov straggling functions are given for relativistic charged incident particles. The calculation of the correction term is based on 1) the differential cross section for relativistic particles given by Bethe, and 2) a heavy hydrogen model for heavy atoms."
"The response of dye-polychlorostyrene film dosimeters are compared at low (~103 rad/sec) and high (~1015 rad/sec) dose rates. Low dose rate exposures were obtained with a 60Co gamma-ray pool source, and high dose rates were obtained with a high-intensity, pulsed electron source. The dosimeter is a solid solution of polychlorostyrene and malachite green methoxide which changes color upon irradiation. Two broad absorption peaks appear in the visible region with maxima at about 425 and 625 nm. The change in optical density of the 625-nm peak was monitored and correlated to the absorbed dose received by the dosimeters. At low dose rates, the source output was determined on the basis of a previous calibration with a carbon calorimeter and a cavity ionization chamber; at high dose rates, a thin dosimeter calibration system was employed. The calibration system has as its primary measuring elements aluminum calorimeters whose temperatures after exposure were monitored by chromel-constantan thermocouples. Associated electronics recorded the outputs of the thermocouples at every 0.1 sec. In the two cases, the dosimeters were exposed in a different but homogeneous medium, carbon or polystyrene at the low dose rates and aluminum at the high dose rates. In addition, Monte Carlo calculated stopping power ratios of the dye-film dosimeter to the medium were required to interpret the dose received by the dosimeters. The results indicate that there is no significant difference in the response at the two different rates."
"In a semiconductor, the formation of a space-charge region is a logical consequence of the creation of a defect cluster. The dependence of cluster size and defect density on neutron energy can be derived directly from neutron-scattering data and recoil range-energy relationships. The effect of clusters on macroscopic semiconductor properties (e.g., recombination rate, carrier removal) is more uncertain, but the shape of the dependence on cluster size is not strongly dependent on the constants used in the calculation. The relative effectiveness of 14- and l-MeV neutrons before annealing is predicted to be significantly larger for recombination rate (factor of 2.7) than for carrier removal (factor of 1.7). The annealing process can decrease this difference. Moreover, it is possible that the time scale on which annealing proceeds can be different for the larger clusters produced by 14-MeV collisions. In establishing relative damage factors between different energy neutrons, it is important to note that the relative damage curve can be a function of the property measured. In comparing the damage produced by reactor neutrons and 14-MeV neutrons, it is important to take into account the very large energy recoils (>300 keV) produced by inelastic interactions of 14-MeV neutrons. These are responsible for intense ionization as well as displacement production. If the contribution from these recoils can be shown to be negligible or to be equivalent to a number of lower-energy recoils not producing as much ionization, the effects of 14-MeV and reactor neutrons can be correlated."
"High resolution neutron spectrum measurements were made in the SPR-II glory hole, at 2.5, 15, 76 and 214 cm outside the core and in the beam port facility with proton-recoil gas proportional counters. The energy ranges were a few keV to 2.7 MeV depending upon the location and the resolution was 12% (ΔE/E, FWHM) over most of the energy range. The data showed that the exterior spectra were somewhat softer than that in the glory hole due to the influence of room return neutrons. Comparisons were made with fission couple measurements and Monte Carlo calculations at the glory hole and 2.5 cm positions. A composite spectrum from 12 keV to 8 MeV was formed from the proton-recoil and fission couple results. Silicon displacement damage was calculated for the various reactor positions using the different spectra."
"An experimental method is given for the conversion of a neutron hardness spectrum to a 14 MeV neutron equivalence fluence by least squares fitting it with four known spectra. The procedure gives both the magnitude and variance of the equivalence. Device or system testing can be conducted with damaging neutrons of any spectral distribution provided the 14 MeV equivalence of the spectrum has been measured."
"This report defines how a neutron energy (1 MeV) equivalence should be calculated and the limitations of its utility. The differences in the l-MeV equivalence obtained by using Messenger's expression for the damage curve is examined. An experiment was performed to verify the adequacy and utility of using l-MeV equivalence units to compare different neutron spectra. It is shown that for fission spectra close to a bare reactor that l-MeV equivalence provides a slight improvement in the correlation of data taken from devices irradiated at different reactors. However, this improvement in correlation did not extend to devices irradiated with 14 MeV neutrons. The devices irradiated in this experiment showed a fission/fusion fluence ratio for equal damage of about 1.7 rather than the expected value of 2.5."
"The electrical properties of electron-irradiated GaAs have been studied. A defect with an energy level located at Ec - 0.15 eV has been identified. It is likely an intrinsic defect as it is produced in all n-type materials. It removes carriers at a rate of 1.6 to 2.2 cm-1 in l-MeV irradiations and 4.5 to 5.9 cm-1 in 30-MeV irradiations. It anneals between 200 and 300°C with an activation energy of 1.2 eV. Another defect with an energy level located at ~Ec - 0.02 eV is also observed in Si-doped material. It removes carriers at a rate of 1.1 cm-1 in l-MeV irradiations and ~7.5 cm-1 in 30-MeV irradiations. It anneals in the same 200 to 300°C stage as the first level. A defect with an energy level located at Ev + 0.17 eV is observed in Zn-doped material following 1-MeV and probably 30-MeV irradiations. It removes carriers at a rate of 2.7 cm-1 in 1-MeV irradiations and ~6 cm-1 in 30-MeV irradiations. It anneals in a stage between 150 and 200°C. A second defect level located at Ev + 0.06 eV is also observed following 30-MeV irradiations. It removes carriers at a rate of ~4.5 cm-1. For heavier irradiations, annealing above 300°C becomes important, and the carrier concentration and the mobility do not anneal together as they do below 300°C in lower-fluence irradiations."
"GaAsP Schottky barrier diodes and Hall effect devices were exposed to fast neutron radiation at room temperature at fluences ranging from 1013 neutrons cm-2 (E > 10 keV) to 8.9 × 1016 neutrons cm-2 (E > 10 keV). The carrier removal rate for the n-type material with a nominal doping of 5 × 1015 cm-3 and irradiated at a fluence of 9.7 × 1014 neutrons cm-2 (E > 10 keV) was determined from the capacitance-voltage characteristics of the diodes and was found to range between 5 and 6 cm-1. The change in conductivity of the GaAsP with neutron radiation measured on the Hall effect devices agrees very well with the diode measurements, while the change in effective carrier concentration appears to be slightly greater in the diodes than in the Hall devices. The Hall effect device measurements showed that the GaAsP material tends to become intrinsic after irradiation at high neutron fluence levels. The decrease in minority carrier lifetime after neutron irradiation was observed from the transient photocurrent response of the neutron-irradiated diodes generated by an ionizing X-ray pulse. Isochronal annealing of the neutron-irradiated diodes showed approximately a 40 percent recovery in carrier concentration over a wide temperature range starting at 225°C and continuing up to the maximum annealing temperature of 580°C."
"Silicon samples which contain a high concentration of dispersed tin have been irradiated at 80°, 140° or 300°K with 3 MeV electrons. The interaction of defects (vacancies and interstitials) with tin was studied by infrared absorption measurements. The tin-vacancy pair was found by monitoring the release of vacancies when the pair anneals near 460°K. Vacancies released from tin are then trapped on oxygen to form the oxygen-vacancy defect which is measured by the strength of the 835 cm-1 line. Because vacancies are trapped at room temperature by tin atoms, tin aids in the separation of vacancy and interstitial associated defects in silicon. An absorption band at 935 cm-1 produced independent of the tin concentration is attributed to silicon interstitials trapped by oxygen in Si. This interstitial defect is stable to 330°K. Applications to devices are suggested."
"Hall coefficient and resistivity measurements were used to determine the apparent carrier concentration and mobility of n-type Ge doped with specific impurities, or grown to contain oxygen, and then altered by annealing, Co60 photon irradiation, or Li diffusion. Annealing at 350°C increased the donor concentration and decreased the mobility of oxygen-doped Ge as a consequence of oxygen clustering. Subsequent annealing at 500°C decreased the donor concentration and increased the mobility as a consequence of oxygen dissociation. Clustering and dissociation were repeated many times with no apparent alteration of total oxygen content. The apparent rate of introduction of lattice defects by Co60 photons was essentially independent of oxygen concentration in Ge containing up to ~ 1016 dissociated oxygen cm-3. Formation of a primary defect state at Ec -0.2 eV was observed for all concentrations. There was no evident interaction between the radiation induced defects and oxygen after defect formation, but some evidence was observed of defect stabilization against annealing in oxygen-doped Ge. There also was no evident interaction between Li and normal donors or oxygen in Ge after Li diffusion, precipitation, and annealing (~ 400°C), but Li interacted with \"deep-level\" acceptor impurities (Ag, Au or Cu) to form donors that were stable up to ≥ 500°C."
"The production of power by fast-breeder and fusion reactors involves the generation of intense fast neutron fluxes. These neutrons cause void swelling and irradiation creep in the normal operating temperature ranges of the two reactor types and give rise to serious design problems. No facilities exist to permit the accelerated study of fast neutron effects, and strong reliance must be placed on simulation of neutron damage by heavy ions. The techniques of heavy-ion damage studies have been established, and the procedures for damage calculations taken to the stage where ion bombardment is proving a valuable tool in the development of advanced reactors. Transmutation processes are also important in these reactors but generally pose less severe problems in terms of the availability of experimental facilities; 14-MeV neutron effects in insulating materials may be an exception, because they require a high intensity neutron source."
"Two displacement thresholds have been observed in ZnO single crystals. Above the lower energy threshold of 310 keV, the carrier removal rate increases quadratically with increasing electron beam energy. Above the second threshold at 900 keV, a sharp reduction in the free carrier microwave absorption is observed. Accompanying this, the EPR resonances for several iron group impurities and for the F+ center (ionized oxygen vacancy) become activated and are observable. The color centers which have been associated with F centers are also activated. After a thermal anneal to remove these color centers, irradiation at lower energies yields the same energy dependence for the production of F+ centers as is observed with the electrical measurements as well as the same threshold at 310 keV. The lower threshold at 310 keV is associated with oxygen displacements while the upper threshold at 900 keV is associated with zinc displacements. On the basis of these assignments, a value for the maximum atomic recoil energy of 57 eV is obtained for both zinc and oxygen displacements."
"A method for determining the depth profile of aluminum atoms near the surface of SiO2 has been demonstrated by means of a sharp 27Al(p,7)28Si resonance. The proton beam from the NRL 5-MV Van de Graaff is passed through two beam-energy analyzers and allowed to fall upon the specimen located in the well of a sodium-iodide gamma-ray detector. The gamma-ray yield is measured as the beam energy is varied in small steps throughout a neighborhood in the vicinity of the resonance energy. The shape of the resulting yield curve depends upon the impurity (implanted) atom profile, the resonance shape, the beam energy distribution, the mean energy loss of the protons as they penetrate the specimen, and the fluctuations about this mean. All factors except the impurity atom concentration depth profile are assumed known and the concentration profile is extracted from the data by iterative syntheses of the yield curve shape and comparison by means of a computer. Depth resolution of the order of 100 A is practicable near the bombarded face of the specimen. The method is capable of an absolute measurement of the number of impurity atoms but that has not been demonstrated in this work. The tesults have been compared with those from a Cameca ion-beam mass spectrometer."
"Evidence has been presented for the presence of mobile ions in ion bombarded SiO2, these ions being possibly protons or sodium ions. A model invoking neutralization of the incident ion beam at the surface, followed by impurity ion transport to the interface under the influence of the field building up across the SiO2 film during bombardment has been constructed to explain the experimental data."
"The role of various impurities in the thermally grown silicon dioxide films of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structures has been investigated. It has been determined that aluminum and sodium within such films strongly influence the radiation-sensitivity of the corresponding MOS devices. The results of the present investigation indicate that much of the radiation-induced positive space charge accumulated within the silicon dioxide films is directly related to the drift and accumulation of ions such as those of sodium. Ionizing radiation, as fran cobalt-60 gamna rays, liberates sodium ions, which are bonded by coulombic forces to non-bridging oxygens, and consequently, the sodium ions drift in the applied gate fields. The space charge due to the accumulation of sodium near the silicon dioxide-silicon interface then causes a perturbation in the surface properties of the silicon. The insight afforded by the above model provides a basis for the fabrication of surface-controlled devices less sensitive to radiation, as well as for the fabrication of radiation dosimeters where the converse in radiation sensitivity is desired. Utilizing appropriate dopants in the silicon dioxide films the desired radiation hardening and dosimetry objectives can be realized."
"Additional process controls which have been implemented by semiconductor manufacturers in order to produce low threshold voltage CMOS integrated circuits are shown to significantly improve the radiation hardness of such devices. In particular, this improvement is directly correlated with reduced concentrations of the sodium impurity which results in smaller threshold voltage shifts for the p-channel (negatively biased) transistors. Further, it has been shown that n-channel devices can be hardened by the technique of ion implantation on production line integrated circuits. Thus, digital CMOS devices hard to greater than a Mrad(Si) have been realized."
"This paper reports the results of a study in which commercially-proven metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes are modified to provide radiation-hardened complementary MOS (CMOS) circuits. Typical silicon-dioxide (SiO2) gateinsulator processes are used, in conjunction with chromium doping, to fabricate hardened MOS capacitors, n and p channel transistors, and CMOS inverter circuits. The resulting CMOS circuits exhibit excellent electrical and performance characteristics and stability, while accumulating more than 107 rads(Si) ionizing-radiation dose, under worst-case conditions. Observable radiation effects are essentially independent of static bias and are minimum under normal, dynamic operating conditions. The approach is not only compatible with commercial SiO2 processes but appears adaptable to dielectric-isolation, such as silicon-on-sapphire (SOS). Hence, the demonstrated technology represents a \"breakthrough\" in the development of cost-effective, stable CMOS devices for use in advanced military systems."
"Complementary symmetry MOS circuits have high noise immunity and low power consumption which make them particularly suitable for military and space applications. A major drawback to their use is radiation sensitivity to accumulated fluences of radiation and also to prompt radiation bursts (transient effects). A significant degree of hardening against transient effects can be achieved by building the circuits in silicon-on-sapphire. This technology provides complete dielectric isolation and reduces photocurrents in the silicon. It is shown that each device type (N and P channel) must operate under both negative and positive gate bias. Therefore, to ensure hardening against an accumulated fluence of radiation, a dielectric which is hard under both polarities of gate bias should be used. Results are presented for CMOS circuits made with Al2O3 gate insulators."
"Activation energy distributions for the positive space charge induced in MOS structures by pulsed ionizing radiation have been calculated from shortterm, isothermal annealing data. These distributions are compared for conventional thermal oxides and oxides implanted with aluminum or sodium ions."
"Three types of memory transistor structures were subjected to gamma, neutron and electron radiation. The survival of stored information as a function of total dose and dose rate was recorded, and in addition, the effect of radiation on the overall writing and storage characteristics of the devices was studied. The results indicate that the threshold voltage vs applied voltage characteristics of the transistors are essentially unchanged up to total doses of 108 rads. A specific bit of stored information will survive 106 rads. The expected insensitivity of stored information to photocurrents during high intensity radiation spikes was proved by experiment."
"P-channel MOS devices with a hardened gate insulator have been irradiated to a combined dose of 2 × 1016 n/cm2 (E>1.5 MeV) and 1 × 108 rads (Si). The resulting degradation in device characteristics is described and compared with that due to gamma radiation alone. Significant neutron-induced channel mobility degradation was observed, but the anticipated changes in source-drain punch-through voltage and body effect due to neutron-induced carrier removal were not observed until subsequent post-radiation annealing. After 1 × 1016 n/cm2 and 1 × 108 rads (Si), the test devices were still operational, with a 50% decrease in drain current and a 4V increase in threshold voltage. The extension of this technology to the fabrication of a 5 ampere power switch and a multiple NOR gate integrated circuit, both hardened to doses above 107 rads (Si), is also described."
"The relative roles of the radiation-induced interface states and oxide charges on the surface degradation of NPN planar transistors have been determined by using gate controlled measurement techniques. Three main conclusions resulted. 1) In general, the new interface states are the more important factor in the surface degradation of NPN transistors with oxide properties similar to those existing in the present study as long as a strong inversion of the base surface is not developed which causes a \"channel\" between the emitter and base contact. Charge buildup would then become the primary factor if extensive channeling did develop; this primarily would occur at high doses. 2) Extensive \"channeling\", affecting the high current gain, did not fully develop in our NPN transistors up to very high doses; however, the possible existence of channeling in other different oxide preparations cannot be ruled out. 3) The nonuniform nature of the charge buildup and the charge of the interface states can contribute significantly to low-current gain degradation."
"The radiation dose dependence of the energy profile of the interface state density, NFS(E), has been monitored for the first time by using quasistatic MOS C-V techniques. The surprising result is that the radiation-induced increases in the interface state density are proportional to the pre-irradiation density regardless of the energy position in the band gap (away from the band edges) and in spite of the differences in the nature of the pre-and post-irradiation interface states. Both undoped and aluminum-implanted silicon dioxide films were used in the MOS devices investigated in this effort. Also, the dose dependence of the capture crosssection for carriers, σ, has been determined for the first time by combining quasistatic MOS capacitance measurements with gate-controlled IEBO measurements. Initial cross section values were consistent with those determined by different techniques, ~6×10-16 cm2. Contrary to the results that have been reported by other workers, σ was found to be relatively constant with respect to changes in NFS. Consequently, the radiation-induced rise in the surface recombination velocity is interpreted as being primarily due to an increase in NFS."
"Devices that utilized three different commercial passivation processes were studied in a nuclear radiation environment to determine if the passivation process influences the radiation tolerance of the device. Comparisons were made between devices obtained from the same manufacturer. The passivation processes studied featured silicon dixoide, silicon nitride and aluminum oxide. Irradiations were performed with the devices in both a biased and unbiased mode. The results show that the device with silicon dioxide passivation degraded the most. The nitride devices having beam leads showed no saturation of the induced degradation while the other processes did for a dose of 1 × 107 (Si). All devices studied showed a small bias dependence. The addition of an aluminum oxide or silicon nitride passivation layer (over the silicon dioxide surface) for an increased reliability definitely induces no increased radiation degradation."
 "The performance of a variety of IMPATT diode oscillators has been measured under transient ionizing radiation conditions, and the results of a large signal model which agrees with experiment are presented. Five hundred milliwatt cw diode oscillators (silicon and gallium arsenide with various types of avalanching junctions) were exposed to 100 nanosecond pulses of 10 MeV electrons at dose rates between 2 × 108 and 8 × 109 rads/sec. With these oscillators, the RF power is reduced at increasing dose rates and is quenched entirely during the radiation pulse at a dose rate dependent upon the DC bias current (greater than 5 × 109 rads/sec for 500 mW oscillators in vacuum). With diodes open to air, oscillators in low Q cavities were quenched during the radiation pulse with a total dose of 500 rads. The results of a large signal theory including the effects of leakage current are presented that agree well with the RF power decrease during irradiation."
"The effects of gamma and neutron radiation on the high frequency characteristics of microwave transistors (HP-35821E) are explored. From theoretical and experimental results, it is determined that the major effect is a decrease in the forward transfer coefficient (S21) resulting from a neutron-enhanced decrease in cutoff frequency (fS) (i.e., increase in emitter-to-collector transit time). For the recommended operating conditions (VCE = 15V, IC = 15 mA) no change in S-parameters was noted after an ionizing dose of 107 rads (Si) in a Co60 source. By increasing the collector voltage so that the epitaxial collector is entirely depleted, these devices can be operated at fluence levels of 8 × 1015 n/cm2 (E> 10 keV)."
"Studies are presented of neutron irradiation effects on microwave bipolar transistors in two applications--small signal, low noise amplifiers and large signal, power amplifiers. In both applications microwave transistors are found to be neutron tolerant. In the low noise case, the amplifier noise figure increases by less than 1 dB after a neutron fluence of 2 × 1015 n/cm2 (E > 10 keV). The observed degradation in noise figure is related both theoretically and experimentally to neutron-induced decreases in DC and low frequency current gain, and good agreement is found. In the power amplifier case, saturated output power and power gain decrease by 1.8 and 3 dB, respectively, after 2 × 1015 n/cm2. The change in saturated output power is related to increased high frequency Vce(sat), while the decreased gain is due to decreased high frequency current gain. Neutron effects on these transistor parameters are calculated from the power output and gain data, and compared with radiation effects on these parameters at low frequencies."
 "The effects of radiation-produced majority carrier traps in junction space-charge regions are reviewed. The nature of trapping states is discussed, and defect states in the upper half of the bandgap are shown to be dominant in p+n junctions. A number of experimental methods for determining trap parameters are examined, and the results of various experiments compared. Three important levels are found at energies 0.48, 0.38, and 0.2 eV below the conduction band edge. Best estimates of the electron capture cross sections are 2 × 10-14, 4 × 10-15, and 1 × 10-19 cm2 respectively. These levels give rise to frequency dependent small-signal device parameters in junction field-effect transistors, as well as time dependent parameters for large signals. Only very slight trapping effects are found in enhancement-mode MOS transistors; however the effects should be much larger in depletion-mode devices. Trapping effects restrict the application of variable capacitor diodes."
"Numerical calculations have been used to study small signal trapping effects in neutron-irradiated pn junctions as a function of frequency. Good agreement has been obtained between the calculations and experimental data in n-type silicon using two acceptor centers to model the trapping centers produced by neutron irradiation. A single level donor center has been used for p-type material. These calculations indicate that complex changes in the carrier distributions within the device can be responsible for a rather simple change in the terminal capacitance and conductance. Although good agreement has been obtained between the calculated and experimental results, the calculations suggest that another deep acceptor level (consisting of about 10% of the total trap density) may be present in n-type material which provides a more gradual change in the terminal capacitance with frequency than that noted using the two acceptor centers."
"A study of short-term annealing in 14-MeVneutron-irradiated silicon devices has been performed employing a dense-plasma-focus fusion neutron generator (typical fluences: 1 to 5 × 1010 n/cm2; pulsewidth ~100 nsec). Fusion-fission comparisons are made basedon companion experiments performed at a Triga reactor and on fast-burst reactor data obtained by Gregory and Sander. For solar cells and bipolar transistors, 14-MeV annealing factors are observed to be larger than their fission counterparts at early times following irradiation. At 20 msec, the fusion-fission annealing-factor ratio has a value typically in the range from 1.3 to 1.4. The unstable damage ratio at this same time is ~1.7 for equal amounts of stable damage. Annealing data for 14-MeV neutron-irradiated solar cells are shown to correlate quite well with electron density. For transistors, the maximum fusion annealing factor observed is ~5 at ~100 μsec for both npn and pnp devices. A qualitative model, based on differing defect densities in fusion and fission disordered regions, is proposed to account for the data. Additionally, a method for estimating transient annealing behavior as a function of neutron energy is presented."
"Empirical relations between post-irradiation photo-voltaic parameters and lithium-donor density gradient have been derived for crucible-grown lithium-containing solar cells irradiated by i MeV electrons to fluences from 3 × 1013 to 3 × 1015e/cm2. Open-circuit voltage increases logarithmically with lithium gradient both immediately after irradiation and after completion of recovery. A particularly strong gradient dependence after recovery from 3 × 1015e/cm2 indicates the need for high lithium gradients (> 5 × 1018cm-4) to maintain satisfactory cell performance after heavy electron irradiation. These, together with previously reported results (l) provide the basis for a mission compatibility analysis for crucible-grown lithium cells in an electron-dominated radiation environment."
"The effects of electron irradiation on the minority carrier diffusion length in silicon devices has been studied by utilizing Pm-147 and Kr-85 beta sources. The beta spectra of Pm-147 and Kr-85 are characterized by maximum beta-particle energies of 230 and 670 kev, respectively. Short-circuit current for Li-doped p+n and n+p cells has been measured while the devices are continually irradiated. All devices have approximately 2 Ω-cm bases. The minority carrier diffusion length of the base region was deduced from the calculated betavoltaic collection efficiency. Finally, the diffusion damage coefficient has been calculated for each case. Kr-85 beta irradiated, Li-doped p+ n cells exhibit a much smaller damage rate for the first few months of testing than n+p cells. After decreasing from approximately 100 to 40 μm, the minority carrier diffusion length for the Li-doped cells began increasing until after 1.5 years of irradiation, it exceeded the initial value. Pm-147 beta-irradiated n+ p devices show only a small anmount of radiation effects. For example, typical values obtained for the damage coefficient are initially 10-13 compared to 10-11 for Kr-85 beta-irradiated n+p cells. Values of approximately 10-7 have been previously reported for n+p cells coupled to 0.5 Mev electrons."
"The effects of fast neutron damage on GaAs laser diodes have been examined with the following results: (1) Infrared photomicrographs of laser output for diodes operating above threshold at 300 K reveal that neutron irradiation does not have a significant effect on the near-field spatial distribution. (2) Neutron irradiation of a group of laser diodes of different cavity lengths demonstrates that the damage-induced increase in threshold current at 300 K is due primarily to a decrease in gain factor. The rate of decrease of the gain factor with neutron fluence agrees with that predicted by a previously determined damage constant. (3) Preliminary measurements of total light output as a function of diode current at 300 K and 76 K show that the lasers are much less sensitive to neutron damage at currents significantly above threshold. In fact, for some diodes the light output at 76 K increases at a given current with neutron irradiation for fluences as high as 3 × 1014 n/cm2."
"Irradiation of GaP (green) and GaAs.1P.9(yellow) light-emitting diodes from a 60Co source results in a decrease in quantum efficiency, peak spectral intensity, brightness and carrier lifetime of the respective devices. Damage constants expressed in terms of absorbed dose are Kιo = 4×10-8 rad(Si)-1 for the green diodes and Kιo = 3×10-8 rads(Si)-1 for the yellow diodes. Following isochronal annealing to 500°C the efficiency, lifetime, and peak spectral intensity recover to 75 percent of their respective initial values. Recovery is noted to start at 250°C."
"Photon-coupled isolators with both photodiode and phototransistor detectors were irradiated to a total dose of 108 rads(Si) at a 60Co source and to a fluence of 3.7×lO13 n/cm2 (E > 10 kev) at a TRIGA reactor. Damage constants for both the biased and unbiased cases were obtained. Decreases in the current transfer ratios at the highest dose were from 60 for the isolators using photodiodes to more than 10,000 for the isolators using phototransistors. No changes were noted in the isolation resistance or the capacitance. Rise and fall times decreased by about a factor of seven for the isolators using phototransistors. After irradiation isochronal annealing data was obtained on the recovery of the degraded parameters."
"Transient (electron) and total (gamma) ionizing radiation effects on dielectrically isolated junction field effect transistors (DIJFET's) are presented as a function of dielectric isolation configuration, dose, dose rate, and bias. Four different device structures of DIJFET's are studied. The three device types incorporating p+ buried layers to separate the SiO2 dielectric from the active n-type channel region are shown to be relatively immune to permanent effects induced by ionizing radiation up to total doses of 108 rads (Si), whereas the device structure utilizing dielectric isolation by simply replacing the substrate junction with a silicon dioxide dielectric showed serious degradation above 105 rads (Si). The DIJFET structures utilizing p+ buried layers are characterized in a transient ionizing radiation environment up to 6×109 rads (Si)/sec and in a total ionizing environment up to 108 rads (Si). The transient photocurrent response of the DIJFET was experimentally determined to be one-fourth that of a regular JFET with the same surface geometry."
"In this paper, we give additional experimental results concerning the anomalous photocurrent problem. Anomalous photocurrents were observed in various epitaxial NPN transistors for different operating modes and bias voltages. It is particularly shor that the devices switch on a stable I(V) characteristic that agrees closely with that given by the avalanche injection mode obtained experimentally with a fast rising high current pulse generator. The triggering mechanism is investigated and emitter injection is found to be a necessary condition. This experimental approach allows us to predict accurately the anomalous photocurrent value without radiation tests and seems to be quite useful in hardening studies."
"The distribution of damage produced by individual 14 MeV neutron events was investigated experimentally. These results were used to establish limits on the probability of failure in large device populations. It was concluded that the damage margin required to allow for extra damaging events is less than 40%, with most systems requiring a margin of less than 15%."

"This note defines a new equivalence relation among systems of recursion equations and a method for assigning context-free grammars to these systems, such that (1) The new equivalence implies strong equivalence; (2) Systems are equivalent in the new sense iff their grammars generate the same language; (3) There is a nontrivial decidable class of systems whose grammars have the decidability properties of LL(k) grammars. Thus, the decidability of generative equivalence for LL(k) grammars mitigates the general undecidability of strong equivalence between arbitrary systems of recursion equations."
 "Our principle technical results are the development of a family of first order logics (called FILs), the translation of classes of program schemes into these logics and the development of routine decision procedures for these representations. We feel the results are interesting because the class of schemes include a previously studied important class (Paterson's monadic non-intersecting loops class), because the decision procedures are routine and the new logics are natural, and finally because this work provides information and tools for the important problem of designing and compiling highly declarative programming languages."
"It is the object of this paper to study the topological properties of finite graphs that can be imbedded in the n-dimensional integral lattice (denoted Nn). The basic notion of deletability of a node is first introduced. A node is deletable with respect to a graph if certain computable conditions are satisfied on its neighborhood. An equivalence relation on graphs called reducibility and denoted by \"∼\" is then defined in terms of deletability and it is shown that (a) most important topological properties of the graph (homotopy, homology and cohomology groups) are ∼-invariants, (b) for graphs imbedded in N3 different knot types belong to different ∼-equivalence classes, (c) it is decidable whether two graphs are reducible to each other in N2 but this problem is undecidable in Nn for n ≥ 4. Finally, it is shown that two different methods of approximating an n-dimensional closed manifold with boundary by a graph of the type studied here lead to graphs whose corresponding homology groups are isomorphic."
 "A new simplified proof of the McCreight-Meyer Honesty or Naming Theorem is given. Let t be a recursive function, and let F(t) be the set of recursive function computable within time bound t. Then it is shown that an honest recursive t′ can be found which is arbitrarily large on a dense set of arguments such that F(t) = F(t′)."
 "In this paper we provide a formulation of the synchronized execution of a system of tasks using generalized P and V operations. We explore the properties of such processes and present as a main result a decision procedure for settling the consistency question."
"This paper reports of part of a contunuing investigation of parallel computation, in particular, efforts toward understanding the nature of different types of parallel control. The first section defines an asynchornous system to be a simple type of state machine. This was arrived at in an attempt to generalize from the types of control in parallel program schemata and networks of asynchronous modules without bounded delays. Asychronous systems with output are also defined in a familiar way. The deviation from standard work comes in the definition of a parallel decomposition of asynchronous systems. Some preliminary work on compositions of this type appears in. Such definitions provide a useful analytic tool for discussion of related therioes."
"It is shown that the problem of evaluating an Nth degree polynomial is reducible to the problem of dividing the polynomial. A method for dividing an Nth degree polynomial by an N/2 degree polynomial in O(N log 2N) steps is given. Using this it is shown that the evaluation of an Nth degree polynomial at N points can be done in O(N log 3N). The related problem of computing of computing the resides of an N precision integer is handed by the same algorithm in O(N log2N loglogN) steps. Using the methods of Horowitz11 and Heindel8 it is shown that interpolation of an Nth degree polynomial is redicible to the problem of evaluating an Nth degree polynomial at N points. An algorithm for preconditioned polynomial interpolation requiring O(N log 2N) steps is presented. This is then extended to perform the complete interpolation in O(N log 3N) steps. A modified version of Reminider Problem in O(N log 2N loglogN) steps."
"Suppose we are given a polynomial in (X1,..., Xr) in r ≥ 1 variables, let m bound the degree of p in all variables Xi, 1≤i≤r, and we wish to raise P to the nth power, n≫1. In a recent paper which compared the iterative versus the binary method it was shown that their respective computing times were O(m2rnr+1) versus O((mn) 2r) when using single precision arithmetic. In this paper a new algorithm is given whose computing time is shown to be O((mn) r+1). Also if we allow for polynomials with multiprecision integer coefficients, the new algorithm presented here will be faster by a factor of mr-1nr over the binary method and faster by a factor of mr-1 over the iterative method. Extensive empirical studies of all three methods show that this new algorithm will be superior for polynomials of even relatively small degree, thus guaranteeing a practical as well as a useful result."
 "It is shown that a strong relationship exists between sets of graphs defined by graph (walking) automata with markers available and sets defined by graph grammars. Polynomial recognition algorithms are presented for certain classes of sets and it is argued that the existence of polynomial algorithms for other classes is doubtful. Other properties of the classes of sets defined by graph automata and graph grammars are also studied."
"The purpose of this paper is to give an alternative proof to the decidability of the emptiness problem for tree automata, as shown in Rabin4. The proof reduces the emptiness problem for automata on infinite trees to that for automata on finite trees, by showing that any automata definable set of infinite trees must contain a finitely-generable tree."
 "We consider several important problems for which no polynomially time bounded algorithm is known. These problems are shown to be related in that a polynomial algorithm for one implies a polynomial algorithm for the others."
 "In this paper we consider polynomial-time algorithms for bin packing and their applications. The previously studied FIRST FIT and BEST FIT algorithms are shown to be special cases of a more generalized class of algorithms which all have similar worst case behavior. Linear time algorithms are then introduced which, though \"faster\" than FIRST FIT and BEST FIT, have the same, or better, worst case behavior. Finally, an improved polynomial-time algorithm is found for a problem of scheduling on multiprocessing systems, by treating this as a bin packing problem."
"A set of tasks {T1, T2, ..., Tr] are to be scheduled on a two-processor computing system. The execution time of each of the tasks is given. Moreover, a partial ordering ≪ over the set of tasks is specified. If Ti ≪ Tj, it is required that the execution of Tj will not begin until the completion of the execution of Ti. Let ω denote the total elapsed time for the execution of all the tasks in the set when an optimal non-preemptive schedule is used. Let ω′ denote the total elapsed time for the execution of all the tasks in the set when an optimal preemptive schedule is used. Trivially, we know that ω ≥ ω′ However, it can be shown that ω′ ≥ 3/4 ω This result can be extended to an n-processor computing system. In this case, ω′ ≥ n+1/2n ω Moreover, these are best possible bounds. A possible interpretation of the results is: The installation of a high speed drum in a two-processor computing system will increase the operation speed of the system by at most 25%. For an n-processor system, the increment is at most 50%. (The installation of a high speed drum enables us to interrupt the execution of tasks at will.)"
"There is a class of flow charts called \"reducible\" for which many global code optimization algorithms have been recently written. As a practical matter, one may expect the flow chart of a program appearing \"in nature\" to be reducible with a probability over 90% [3], and those that are not can be made reducible by \"node splitting\" [10]. Unfortunately, the algorithms written for reducible graphs do not really take advantage of reducibility, since they require O(n2) bit vecter steps in worst case, the same as for the obvious general algorithms of these types. In this paper we give an O(n log n) bit vecter step algorithm to determine \"available expressions,\" [7]. This information is essential for global elimination of common subexpressions. However, the ideas discussed here carry over to other global code optimization problems such as \"reaching definitions\" [1], \"live variables\" [9] and \"very busy variables\" [6]."
"This paper examines the problem of finding a single universal test set that will test any of a variety of different implementations of a given switching function. It is shown that, for and/or networks, universal test sets may be found which detect not only all single faults but all multiple faults as well. The minimality and size of these sets are examined and their derivation for incomplete and multiple-output functions is described. The extension of these results to other network types is discussed."
"Fault detecting test sets to detect multiple stuck-at-faults in certain networks realizing Reed-Muller canonic expressions are given. It is shown that to detect t faults, t ≥ 1, in a network realizing an arbitrary n-variable logic function only 4 + Σ i=1 [log22t] (in) tests need be applied ([x] is the integer part of x) and that these tests are independent of the function being realized. Techniques to design the checker for these test sets are given."
"Some results concerning uniform modular decomposition are presented. The primary concern is with the number of inputs which a universal module must have and also with the conditions which a module must satisfy if it is to be output sufficient. It is shown that the number of inputs required by an output sufficient module grows exponentially with the number of inputs to the sequential machines to be realized. If the special class of strongly connected modules which have a minimal number of inputs is considered, then the module is output sufficient if and only if each state of the module is output onto. This condition can be tested by a simple examination of the state table of the module. If the module has more than the minimal number of inputs, this condition is no longer necessary. A test for the output sufficiency of an arbitrary module has not yet been found."
"A set of positive integers is said to be recognizable by a push-down automaton if its elements, written in k-ary notation for some k ≥ 2, form a context-free language. Some general properties of this type of sets are given. The set of squares is shown not to be recognizable. A necessary condition is proved for a subset of a set defined by a linear recurrence relation of some special form to be recognizable. The set of square-free integers is investigated."
"This paper presents several representations of the recursively enumerable (r.e.) sets. The first states that every r.e. set is the homomorphic image of the intersection of two linear context-free languages. Another states that every r.e. set is accepted by an on-line Turing acceptor with two pushdown stores such that in every computation, each pushdown store can make at most one reversal (that is, one change from \"pushing\" to \"popping\"). It is shown that this automatatheoretic representation cannot be strengthened by restricting the acceptors to be either deterministic multitape, nondeterministic one-tape, or nondeterministic multicounter acceptors. An investigation of the properties of reversal-bounded computations suggests that reversal bounds are not a \"natural\" measure of computational complexity for multitape Turing acceptors. The above results are used to obtain an independence theorem for full semi-AFLs and an undecidability result for effective families of languages."
"This paper is concerned with the problem of detecting when two asynchronous control systems are equivalent. The systems investigated in the paper are first represented by means of a formal model called an asynchronous control structure (ACS). This model specifies the constraints imposed on the generation of control signals by a system by means of a simple graphical model called a marked graph. Behavioral equivalence is then characterized in terms of the set of all possible sequences of control signals that can be generated by the system. These sequences are represented by means of another (infinite) marked graph, called a behavior graph. Finally, it is shown that two control systems are equivalent if and only if their behavior graph representations have identical (finite) generating sets."

  "A synthesis procedure for failure-tolerant sequential circuits using error-correcting codes is presented. Coding redundancy is then compared with replication as to circuit complexity and reliability improvement. Using appropriate assumptions, it is shown that for a specified ability to tolerate failures, replication yields better circuit reliability than coding redundancy. When circuit complexity as well as reliability are taken into consideration, it is shown that schemes based on orthogonizable codes generally provide a greater improvement in reliability for a given complexity than replication. As in any redundant scheme, these results presuppose reasonably good reliabilities for irredundant circuits."
"This paper describes a set of techniques that can be used to optimally schedule a sequence of interrelated computational tasks on a multiprocessor computer system. Using a directed graph model to represent a computational process, two basic problems are solved here. First, given a set of computational tasks and the relationships between them, the tasks are scheduled such that the total execution time is minimized, and the minimum number of processors required to realize this schedule is obtained. The second problem is of a more general nature. Given k processors, the tasks are scheduled such that execution time is again minimized. Consideration is given to tasks of equal and unequal duration, and task preemption is not allowed."
"A key problem in the effective use of large-scale integration is the design and partitioning of computer logic to achieve sufficiently high circuit-to-pin ratios. In this paper a power-law relationship between pins and partitioned circuits is discussed and empirical evidence is presented that implies that the pin requirement is a sensitive function of the performance level of the logic. Two techniques for increasing the circuit-to-pin ratio are discussed. The first is to serialize the interchip transfer of information that results in a degradation in performance of the logic. The second is to encode the information to be transferred so that fewer pins are required but without reducing the performance. The results of experiments using the encoding principle to map a small logic graph onto chips are presented to obtain an indication of the effectiveness of this technique. It is shown that the relationship between circuits and pins when using encoding remains a power law."
"Optimal networks consisting of NOR-OR gates (each gate produces the NOR and/or the OR of its inputs) are tabulated for all Boolean functions of three variables. Optimality is defined as minimizing first the number of gates and then the number of interconnections. The optimal networks were synthesized for each Boolean function by using an integer programming synthesis technique."
"An intelligent robot that recognizes and assembles three-dimensional objects by means of vidicon cameras, an articulated mechanical hand, and a digital computer is described. Its problem-solving functions include three essential parts: the recognition of macro-instructions from a human master, the recognition of the objects to be handled, and the decision making for executing the necessary tasks. The instruction is in the form of a three-view plan of a simple polyhedral assemblage whose overall spatial configuration is recognized together with its component parts. In this process the set of planes of the assemblage is disassembled into open shells; these are then reconstructed into closed shells to find the parts by solving a linear equation where the shell vectors are taken into consideration. In the object recognition, all the geometric features of polygonal prisms in the field of vision are extracted to find the specific parts required for the assembly. Further computation is made to search for the assembly procedure and is based on the restraint vectors of each object and consequent disassembly free. Finally, the mechanical hand starts the autonomous manipulation of the parts so as to accomplish the assigned assembly."
"The problem of clustering multivariate observations is viewed as the replacement of a set of vectors with a set of labels and representative vectors. A general criterion for clustering is derived as a measure of representation error. Some special cases are derived by simplifying the general criterion. A general algorithm for finding the optimum classification with respect to a given criterion is derived. For a particular case, the algorithm reduces to a repeated application of a straightforward decision rule which behaves as a valley-seeking technique. Asymptotic properties of the procedure are developed. Numerical examples are presented for the finite sample case."
"The automatic determination of local similarity between two structured data sets is fundamental to the disciplines of pattern recognition and image processing. A class of algorithms, which may be used to determine similarity in a far more efficient manner than methods currently in use, is introduced in this paper. There may be a saving of computation time of two orders of magnitude or more by adopting this new approach. The problem of translational image registration, used for an example throughout, is discussed and the problems with the most widely used method-correlation explained. Simple implementations of the new algorithms are introduced to motivate the basic idea of their structure. Real data from ITOS-1 satellites are presented to give meaningful empirical justification for theoretical predictions."
"A proof is given of a method proposed by Lackey and Meltzer [2] for determining the selection of Rademacher functions that must be combined to generate a specified Walsh function. The method provides a convenient way of digitally controlling a Walsh function generator."
"A tool employed in automated fault diagnosis is emphasized: path sensitization by partial Boolean difference analysis. Motivated by the analogy between a test system and a communication system, a model for fault detection of a logic net is outlined from the standpoint of information theory. The classical ``path sensitizing'' technique is made systematic using the partial Boolean difference. This technique is based on a new theorem on the partial Boolean difference. Finally, a programmable fault detection algorithm is presented along with an example."
"A pattern-recognition method, making use of Fourier transformations to extract features which are significant for a pattern, is described. The ordinary Fourier coefficients are difficult to use as input to categorizers because they contain factors dependent upon size and rotation as well as an arbitrary phase angle. From these Fourier coefficients, however, other more useful features can easily be derived. By using these derived property constants, a distinction can be made between genuine shape constants and constants representing size, location, and orientation. The usefulness of the method has been tested with a computer program that was used to classify 175 samples of handprinted letters, e.g., 7 sets of the 25 letters A to Z. In this test, 98 percent were correctly recognized when a simple nonoptimized decision method was used. The last section contains some considerations of the technical realizability of a fast preprocessing system for reading printed text."
"The number of black points in each of the 25 nonoverlapping square regions of a size-normalized character matrix were used to recognize the 3822 uppercase handprinted alphabetic characters from Munson's multiauthor data set. The recognition accuracy obtained using a Bayes' classifier, which assumes statistically independent features, compares favorably with earlier results obtained using recognition systems having complexity comparable to ours. Included are results and a recommendation regarding system evaluation procedures."
"It is shown that for n-valued conditionally independent features a large family of classifiers can be expressed as an (n-1)st-degree polynomial discriminant function. The usefulness of the polynomial expansion is discussed and demonstrated by considering the first-order Minkowski metric, the Euclidean distance, and Bayes' classifiers for the ternary-feature case. Finally, some interesting side observations on the classifiers are made with respect to optimality and computational requirements."
"The solution of the problem of the existence of an analog with periodic-variable structure of a given fixed-structure connected automaton is presented. Using a Boolean approach, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the periodic analog is proven, and an algorithm that enables us to actually find this analog is given. The saving of the memory capacity needed for the construction of a given automaton is the main interest of the existence of a periodic analog."
"The orthogonal expansion of many-valued logical functions is described and some approximate forms derived from it are discussed. A method of logical design of many-valued functions, especially threshold functions, using a single-threshold element is proposed based on the approximate forms."
 "To demonstrate transference, experiments have been carried out in which the recognition of Highleyman's handprinted numerals was a few percent more accurate when numerals and letters were used as a training set than when only numerals were used as a training set."
"An alternative metric for use with Sammon's nonlinear mapping is suggested. Rather than Euclidean, the Hamming metric is proposed as a means of reducing the iteration time."

 "An abstract model for the execution of fuzzy programs using finite-state machines is described, Different ways of executing fuzzy programs are investigated. It is shown that the performance function λ of a fuzzy machine M can be effectively constructed so that the program searching cost of an elementary fuzzy program, a number of elementary fuzzy programs, or a regular fuzzy program is minimized. Some application examples are discussed."
"It is presently known that (single) error correction in adders can be obtained by use of biresidue codes, which use two separate checkers with respect to two different check bases of the form 2c -1. It is shown here that a class of systematic subcodes derived from the nonsystematic AN codes can provide error correction using only one checker. However, the check base A of these codes is not of the form 2c -1 and therefore involves a somewhat complex addition structure involving two or more end-around-carries (EAC's). Here we present a generalized theory for the construction of a systematic subcode for a given AN code in such a way that error control properties of the AN code are preserved in this new code. The ``systematic weight'' and ``systematic distance'' functions in this new code depend not only on its number representation system but also on its addition structure. Finally, to illustrate this theory, a simple error-correcting adder organization using a systematic subcode of 29 N code is sketched in some detail."
"The minimum-perimeter polygon of a silhouette has been shown to be a means for recognizing convex silhouettes and for smoothing the effects of digitization in silhouettes. We describe a new method of computing the minimum-perimeter polygon (MPP) of any digitized silhouette satisfying certain constraints of connectedness and smoothness, and establish the underlying theory. Such a digitized silhouette is called a ``regular complex,'' in accordance with the usage in piecewise linear topology. The method makes use of the concept of a stretched string constrained to lie in the cellular boundary of the digitized silhouette. We show that, by properly marking the virtual as well as the real vertices of an MPP, the MPP can serve as a precise representation of any regular complex, and that this representation is often an economical one."
"A method for the analysis and synthesis of closed curves in the plane is developed using the Fourier descriptors FD's of Cosgriff [1]. A curve is represented parametrically as a function of arc length by the accumulated change in direction of the curve since the starting point. This function is expanded in a Fourier series and the coefficients are arranged in the amplitude/phase-angle form. It is shown that the amplitudes are pure form invariants as well as are certain simple functions of phase angles. Rotational and axial symmetry are related directly to simple properties of the Fourier descriptors. An analysis of shape similarity or symmetry can be based on these relationships; also closed symmetric curves can be synthesized from almost arbitrary Fourier descriptors. It is established that the Fourier series expansion is optimal and unique with respect to obtaining coefficients insensitive to starting point. Several examples are provided to indicate the usefulness of Fourier descriptors as features for shape discrimination and a number of interesting symmetric curves are generated by computer and plotted out."
"A new algorithm for asynchronous machines is presented. The problem is formulated and solved in graph-theoretic terms. A graph-embedding algorithm in an n-cube developed in Sections I-III is used to establish the encoding method. The resulting critical race free encoding minimizes the dimensions of the internal variables and the transition times. This method should be especially interesting for large incomplete machines."
"A technique for obtaining the digital Walsh-Hadamard transform of two-dimensional discrete pictures in real time is presented. A considerable reduction in total time for the transformation of a picture results since the process of scanning and digitizing one picture line overlaps with computations on the previous line. This is accomplished by operating on each picture line as it is generated from the scanner, instead of starting the transformation operation after the entire picture has been scanned. Two theorems are presented which decompose a picture by row or by column to facilitate real-time transformation. Based on these theorems, a hardware machine for real-time parallel Walsh-Hadamard transformation is introduced."
"Methods are presented for tracking the variable parameters of sampled-data systems by a model. Both linear and nonlinear systems are considered and use is made of parameter sensitivity functions. The proposed schemes are divided into the identification error method and the output error method. Under suitable assumptions, the identification error method ensures that the system is closely tracked by the corresponding model parameters. The examples are simulated on IBM 360/67 computer using CSMP language."
"It is shown that when discrete experimental data are smoothed by fitting 2m + 1 consecutive data to a polynomial of 2nth degree, with n≪m, and when n and m are increased indefinitely, the smoothing obtained is equivalent to passing the original data through an ideal low-pass filter."
"In earlier papers no analysis characterizing faulty four-phase MOS logic arrays due to single load and sampling transistor faults has been given. In this note the models due to faulty load and sampling transistors are analyzed and discussed. Some useful results leading to faster simulation of four-phase MOS logic arrays with single faulty load and sampling transistors are presented. The computer simulation run time is reduced by one half for single-load transistor faults. At the end of each bit a shorted sampling transistor does not introduce any error for gate types 2 and 3 when initialization is with phase-4 time and for gate types 1 and 4 when initialization is with phase-2 time."
"A terminal stuck fault in a logic network is represented by one or more stuck-at-1 or stuck-at-0 faults on the n input lines or single output. It is shown that for n ≤ 5, a least upper bound on the test length is n + 1, and for n > 5, an upper bound is 2n - 4. A greatest lower bound is 3, for all n > 1. The upper bounds are based on a maximum size alternating 1-tree in the n-cube representation of the function. Of the more than 600 000 equivalence classes of functions of n variables, n ≤ 5, only one does not have an n-edge alternating 1-tree. An algorithm is proposed for constructing tests based on alternating 1-trees."
"A direct method of determining the maximum compatibility sets of an incompletely specified flow table of a sequential machine is presented. Subsets of pairwise incompatibles are utilized to decompose the set of all states in a step-by-step process into the maximum compatibles in a few steps. The method is simpler and faster than previously reported tabular, algebraic, and graphical techniques."
"This note describes an algorithm for identifying multivalued symmetric switching functions using parallel processing. Some general properties of multivalued symmetric functions have been investigated. The mixed multivalued symmetric switching function is defined and an algorithm for identifying it is also presented."
"This correspondence derives a lower bound for the size of a minimal solution of a 0-1 covering problem."
"This correspondence points out some discrepancies observed in [2]-[5] in the formulation of the sequential decision process for simplifying approximations to the probability distributions. The authors use two mutually contradictory conditions in introducing the approximations. The correct form of the functional equation for statistically independent features is presented."

 "Many cases arise in practice where a versatile hardwired pseudorandom number or pseudonoise generator would be extremely useful. General-purpose pseudonoise devices are not available today. We present a new sampling method, conditional bit sampling, which is suited for hardwired sampling devices because of its generality, simplicity, and accuracy. Random variables sampled from an arbitrary distribution are generated bit by bit from high- to low-order bits with the conditional bit algorithm. The result of a comparison of a uniform number to a conditional probability determines whether a bit in the sampled random number is set to one. The conditional probabilities are easily calculated for any probability distribution and must be arranged in special order. Simple Fortran programs make all necessary computations. Agreement between actual and theoretical performance of the conditional bit algorithm was excellent when sampling accuracy was evaluated for several examples of continuous and discrete densities. Sampling from empirically known, perhaps erratic-shaped, densities presents no problems. Only a small memory containing the conditional probabilities needs to be changed to alter the sampled distribution. The conditional bit algorithmic process always remains the same."
"A hardwired device that produces a voltage with arbitrary amplitude distribution was constructed using a \"conditional bit\" algorithm to sample from an arbitrary voltage amplitude distribution. The sampling algorithm and hardware processor are independent of the distribution sampled. Only a small read-only memory ROM needs to be changed to alter the distribution sampled. It is possible to compute the accuracy of the sampled random variables from knowledge of the read-only memory contents. The sampling accuracy of the device may be arbitrarily increased by varying any of several design parameters. Our particular pseudonoise generator produced 200 000 random seven-bit variables/s. Contents of read-only memories for both a Gaussian and an arbitrary density were computed so that the maximum error was less than 2.73 percent. Both the sampling speed and accuracy of a conditional bit pseudonoise generator can be increased much in excess of our implementation."
"A new model for associative memory, based on a correlation matrix, is suggested. In this model information is accumulated on memory elements as products of component data. Denoting a key vector by q(p), and the data associated with it by another vector x(p), the pairs (q(p), x(p)) are memorized in the form of a matrix {see the Equation in PDF File} where c is a constant. A randomly selected subset of the elements of Mxq can also be used for memorizing. The recalling of a particular datum x(r) is made by a transformation x(r)=Mxqq(r). This model is failure tolerant and facilitates associative search of information; these are properties that are usually assigned to holographic memories. Two classes of memories are discussed: a complete correlation matrix memory (CCMM), and randomly organized incomplete correlation matrix memories (ICMM). The data recalled from the latter are stochastic variables but the fidelity of recall is shown to have a deterministic limit if the number of memory elements grows without limits. A special case of correlation matrix memories is the auto-associative memory in which any part of the memorized information can be used as a key. The memories are selective with respect to accumulated data. The ICMM exhibits adaptive improvement under certain circumstances. It is also suggested that correlation matrix memories could be applied for the classification of data."
"Dynamic memories are commonly constructed as circulating shift registers, and thus have access times that are proportional to the size of memory. When each word in a dynamic memory is connected to r words, r ≥ 2, access time can be proportional to the base r logarithm of the size of memory. A memory that achieves minimum access time for r = 2 is described. The memory can also be operated in an efficient binary search mode. Slight variations of the interconnection patterns lead to a memory that is well suited for FFT and certain matrix computations."
"For many real-time signal processing problems, correlations, convolutions, and Fourier analysis must be performed in special-purpose digital hardware. At relatively high levels of performance, it becomes necessary for this hardware to perform some of its computations in parallel. A parallel FFT algorithm is described that segments the fast Fourier transform algorithm into groups of identical parallel operations that can be performed concurrently and independently. A hardware implementation of the algorithm is described in the context of the parallel element processing ensemble (PEPE) previously described by Githens [7], [8]."
"In this paper we study feedback in sequential machines that are implemented with trigger or set-reset flip-flop memory elements. A method is given for determining when a machine can be implemented with either trigger or set-reset flip-flop memory elements where the feedback in the machine is given by a Boolean function f. Several results are presented that compare the feedback when a machine is implemented with different memory elements. It is shown that if a sequential machine can be implemented with unit delay memory elements with feedback function f, then it can be realized with set-reset flip-flop with the same feedback function f. For completely specified machines, it is shown that if a machine implemented with trigger flip-flop has no feedback, then the some machine implemented with unit delays will have feedback. Conversely, if an implementation with unit delays has no feedback, then an implementation with trigger flip-flops will have feedback."
"A random search technique for function minimization is proposed that incorporates the step-size and direction adaptivity of Hooke and Jeeves' [1] pattern search. Experimental results for a variety of functions indicate that the random pattern search is more effective than the corresponding deterministic method for a class of problems with hard constraints."
"The definition of the generalized fault table [1] is expanded to cover a representation employing more than one fault q cube per fault pattern. On the basis of this expanded definition and simple concepts from a cover algebra, a new procedure is developed for finding first- and second-order diagnostic resolutions."
"A stochastic sequential machine model is employed to investigate some of the problems concerning the reliability of sequential machines. Two methods, using the notions of entropy for stochastic automata and principal entries in their transition matrices, are used and compared for reliability estimates. The problem of synthesizing automata of given known reliability through replication and voting is also examined."
"A new approach to the design of complex logic circuitry using magnetic bubbles is described. The method is based on the construction of cells that perform simple logical operations and that can be combined to realize more complex functions. An important property of these cells is that no bubbles ever enter or leave any cell, all intercell communications being accomplished by bubble interactions near the cell boundaries. Illustratively, a set of four basic cells is described which is sufficient to realize all combinatorial and sequential switching functions. The cells possess an important synchronization property that allows them to be combined in a manner quite similar to combining semiconductor gates in current technology."
"A modification of conventional training techniques for linear threshold dichotomous pattern recognition is described. The modification is capable of convergence in some cases where the classical training techniques are not. The utility of this technique for signal detection problems is discussed."
"A theorem and two applications are given here to solve the problem of selecting state assignments of asynchronous machines. The assignment has to produce a set of simple next-state equations. The proofs use the algebraic structures defined by Hartmanis. A first illustration is given by Liu's encoding; likewise, Tracey's selection theorems are easily found again and placed in a more general context."
"In this note we discuss a few attributes and pitfalls of three-valued (0, 1, u) digital logic simulation. The areas covered include hazard and race detection, fault detection, verifying the reset logic of a machine, and the problems encountered with self-timing circuits and in employing a complement for u."
"This note discusses the generation of ternary threshold functions of three variables. Merrill's generation method to generate ternary threshold functions is modified. The number of ternary threshold functions of three variables is counted by a computer, the number is 85629. Tables of characterizing parameters of canonical ternary threshold functions of two and three variables are presented. A table-lookup method to realize ternary threshold functions is given. It is verified that the complete monotonicity (three-value extension of the complete monotonicity in two-valued logic) is a sufficient condition for a ternary three-variable switching function to be a ternary threshold function."
"Some comments on a recent note for the synthesis of TANT networks are presented. Counter examples that show some defects of the technique are also included."

  "It is shown how single-error correction in a residue arithmetic system can be accomplished in an efficient and fast manner. Two redundant moduli are necessary. This construction is extended to multiple errors. Another method of error detection or correction for residue arithmetic is also described. Implementation of these methods is considered. An example of the single-error correction procedure is given."
"Reliability is an important aspect of any system. On-line diagnosis, parity check coding, triple modular redundancy, and other methods have been used to improve the reliability of computing systems. In this paper another aspect of reliable computing systems is explored. The problem is that of recovering error-free information when an error is detected at some stage in the processing of a program. If an error or fault is detected while a program is being processed and if it cannot be corrected immediately, it may be necessary to run the entire program again. The time spent in rerunning the program may be substantial and in some real time applications critical. Recovery time can be reduced by saving states of the program (all the information stored in registers, primary and secondary storage, etc.) at intervals, as the processing continues. If an error is detected the program is restarted from its most recently saved state. However, a price is paid in saving a state in the form of time spent storing all the relevant information in secondary storage. Hence it is expensive to save the state of the program too often. Not saving any state of the program may cause an unacceptably large recovery time. The problem that we solve is the following. Determine the optimum points at which the state of the program should be stored to recover after any malfunction."
"New techniques are presented for generating fault-detection experiments for combinational logic networks. Only single-output functions are considered. Test-covering and test-equivalence relations between networks are defined and these relations are shown to be Instrumental in generating the experiments. The techniques presented provide minimal experiments for detecting multiple faults In two-level networks and provide nearly minimal experiments for most other networks."
"A computer program, which has a Boolean expression and a functionally complete set of switching functions as input data and as output data, gives a description of a logic diagram that shows the synthesized switching circuit realizing the Boolean expression, is described in this paper. The program utilizes a new proof for a generalized version of a theorem that was first stated by Ashenhurst. It is shown that an implementation of a modified form of the decomposition chart technique is indeed useful for the synthesis of combinational switching circuits."
"The design of optimal logic networks is formulated as integer programming (IP) problems. This formulation has the following advantages over other methods of logic design. 1) General feed-forward networks can be dealt with rather than two-level or three-level networks usually treated in conventional switching theory. 2) Network restrictions such as fan-in and fan-out restrictions are easily incorporated. 3) Various gate types such as NOR, NAND, AND-OR combination, NOR-AND combination, and those gates with NOR-OR dual outputs can be treated. 4) Various objectives such as the number of gates and the number of connections are minimized. 5) Incompletely specified functions can be handled without additional difficulty. 6) The formulation can be extended to multiple-output networks. To solve the resulting IP problems, the implicit enumeration method of integer programming is found to be suitable. An IP code ILLIP (Illinois Integer Programming Code) is implemented based on the implicit enumeration by incorporating some new gimmicks such as pseudounderlining. Then the ILLIP is used to solve the IP problems for logical design by making use of the inherent structure of our problems. Various optimal networks are derived by a computer as follows: optimal NOR networks and optimal NOR-AND networks for all functions of up through three variables, one-bit adders with various gate types, and others. These results indicate the computational feasibility of the integer programming approach."
"A recurrence technique is described that enables the use of proven efficient Fourier transform techniques to be applied to the expansion of a given function in terms of spherical harmonics."
"By considering universal logic modules whose terminals may be interconnected, new designs are presented for six, nine, and ten arguments, whose numbers of terminals represent substantial improvements over previously known designs."
"Given some unknown object belonging to a known finite set of n possibilities, it is required to determine its identity by successive comparisons with each of the possibilities. Associating with each of these possibilities a testing cost and a probability that it is identical to the unknown object, we would like to obtain such a testing procedure which has minimum expected testing cost. Intuitively, it would appear that one should proceed by always applying the remaining test with least cost/probability ratio. We show that this technique does not necessarily yield the optimal procedure and present an algorithm which determines the optimal testing sequence in a number of steps proportional to n · log2 n."
"A polynomial definition of the Walsh functions (very similar to that used by Titsworth [9] or Pearl [7]) is shown to be equivalent to Pichler-Harmuth's formulas [3]. It gives an easy way to derive some properties of Walsh functions, such as their relationship with the Gray code or the shifting theorem."
"The Nerode realization technique for synthesizing finite-state machines from their associated right-invariant equivalence relations is modified to give a method for synthesizing machines from finite subsets of their input-output behavior. The synthesis procedure includes a parameter that one may adjust to obtain machines that represent the desired behavior with varying degrees of accuracy and that consequently have varying complexities. We discuss some of the uses of the method, including an application to a sequential learning problem."
"The bound on the length of checking experiments derived by Murakami et al. [1] is improved by using a more efficient output specification in the counter cycle."
"A finite-state machine (FSM) is said to have finite input-memory, μi (finite output-memory μo) if μi(μo) is the least integer such that yk = f(Xk, Xk-1,..., Xk-μi), (yk = f(Xk, yk-1,..., yk-μo)). If no such integer μi(μo) exists then by convention μi = ∞ (μ0 = ∞). It is well known that for a nondegenerate binary-input binary-output FSM M, μi ≥ [log2 n] (μo ≥ [log2 n]), where n is the number of non-equivalent states in M. In this note we show that the above bound cannot be improved upon by giving a procedure to construct, for any n > 0, a binary-input binary-output FSM with n nonequivalent states and minimal input-memory μi = [log2 n] (minimal output-memory μo = [ log2 n]). In the process of proving the tightness of the lower bound on μi(μo), we enumerate the number of distinct minimal binary r-stage feed-forward (output feedback) shift registers."
"A general result on Boolean set extraction is obtained. By partitioning Boolean cubes into two sets as they are generated, both computational effort of redundant cube elimination and memory requirements are reduced. The extraction procedure is computer implemented and applied to the exact solution of covering-closure tables for any given cost criterion."
"This note attempts to show that, in a vertex weight method [1], every contradiction equation bears a one-to-one correspondence with the summability pair C1S, C2S, where C1S = {X11, X12, ..., X1k}⊆ C1 C2S = {X21, X22,..., X2k} ⊆ C2 and vector sums of the vertices plz check [Eqa] The vertices, Xki's, K = 1, or 2, are not necessarily distinct, and C1, C2 are two disjoint sets of vertices in En space. As a consequence, the contradiction equation is a necessary and sufficient condition that the homogeneous system, solved for a threshold function of order r, has no solution. This tells that the threshold function is of order greater than r."
"A system of N-valued logic that is based on three basic sets of functions is described. These functions are selected so that they are easy to realize physically with conventional electronic circuitry. Furthermore, the system is functionally complete."
"The minimum number of comparators S(N) required by an N-input sorting network is bounded below by S(N) ≥ N[log2 (N) - 1] + 0(1), as a consequence of the theorem S(N) ≥ S(N - 1) + [log2 (N)]."
"In a new theorem (proved by elementary combinatorial results) the number of nonequivalent state assignments as defined in [2] and [3] is determined. The number of nondegenerate state assignments is also computed."
"Random binary digits are generated by sampling clipped band-limited white noise. It is shown how to choose the optimum passband cutoff frequencies for a specified sampling rate and a maximum allowed bit-to-bit correlation."

 "With the increasing availability of high-speed multiplication units in large computers it is attractive to develop an iterative procedure to compute division and square root, using multiplication as the primary operation. In this paper, we present three new methods of performing square rooting rapidly which utilize multiplication and no division. Each algorithm is considered for convergence rate, efficiency, and implementation. The most typical and efficient one of the already-known algorithms which utilizes multiplication, here called the N algorithm, is introduced for the purpose of comparison with the new algorithms. The effect and importance of the initial approximation is considered. (One of the algorithms, here called the G algorithm, is described in detail with the emphasis on its high efficiency.)"
"A rectangular logic array is described that can realize any combinational switching function. Straightforward analysis and synthesis procedures are described and the realizations of a number of special functions are given. These include threshold functions, parity functions, symmetric functions, and universal logic functions. Other properties of the array which are examined include diagnostic procedures, isolating defective cells, bounds on the array size, and possible implementations of the basic cell."
"A new representation for faults in combinational digital circuits is presented. Faults that are inherently indistinguishable are identified and combined into classes that form a geometric structure that effectively subdivides the original circuit into fan-out-free segments. This fan-out-free characteristic allows a simplified analysis of multiple fault conditions. For certain circuits, including all two-level single-output circuits, it is shown that the detection of all single faults implies the detection of all multiple faults. The behavior of any circuit under fault conditions is represented in terms of the classes of indistinguishable faults. This results in a description of the faulty circuit by means of Boolean equations that are readily manipulated for the purpose of fault simulation or test generation. A connection graph interpretation of this fault representation is discussed. Heuristic methods for the selection of efficient tests without extensive computation are derived from these connection graphs."
"A new redundancy technique termed dotted logic is presented. Critical input errors are eliminated by joining together the output of NAND gates and NOR gates. The remaining subcritical errors are corrected by introducing redundant inputs to each logic element. Two different schemes, dotted alternating and dotted identical, are described and compared with existing error-correcting techniques. It is shown that these new methods have several advantages over quadded or triple modular redundancy (TMR) networks. In addition to correcting single faults, dotted schemes are easily extended to cover multiple faults. Methods for initial failure determinations for dotted schemes are proposed. Finally, it is shown that a network consisting of complex function elements can be made more reliable by dotting."
"In optimal resource allocation problems the Dynostat algorithm separates the overall optimization task into less complicated optimum seeking techniques working in parallel. A hybrid computer implementation is shown to provide a much faster optimizer than was previously the case using a digital computer. Solution accuracies are considered adequate for many practical applications. The improved formulation presented of gradient search is advantageous for high-speed optimization. Confidence is increased in analog computer solutions by introducing auxiliary algorithms that check on solution feasibility and also improve accuracy."
"Two addition and three multiplication algorithms were studied to see the effect of pipelining on system efficiency. A definition of efficiency was derived to compare the relative merits of various algorithms and implementations for addition and multiplication. This definition is basically defined as bandwidth cost. Previous comparisons of adders and multipliers have generally been based on latency. In a pipeline environment, latency (or its inverse bandwidth) is not as important. Any bandwidth is possible up to the physical limitations on gate delay variations and pulse skew. The formal definition for efficiency is efficiency = N/D·G where N is the number of bits in the operands, D is the delay (uniform) of each pipeline stage in units of gate delays, and G is the total number of gates, including any used for latching. In cases where gate variations and pulse skewing are well defined, pipelining using the Earle latch results in increased efficiency. The most efficient adder is a maximally pipelined conditional-sum adder (three stages with a delay of four gates per stage). Its efficiency is 6.30×10-3. The most efficient multiplier is a maximally pipelined tree multiplier (eight stages with a delay of four gates per stage). Its efficiency is 3.48×10-4."
"The bandwidth limitations of the practical analog-computer units lead to dynamic errors in the computer solution. These errors can be represented either as a slight shift in the root positions of the system characteristic equation or as perturbations in the constant coefficients of the differential equation under solution. In this note, the authors report a unified approach to combine these two representations of dynamic errors and also show that these errors can be compensated for by setting the system after initial perturbations in its constant coefficients and in its driving functions have occurred. The approach is generalized for a system of simultaneous linear differential equations with constant coefficients. This technique will be of value in achieving a reasonable degree of accuracy with relatively inexpensive analog-computer components, and in extending the range of operating frequencies for a certain specified accuracy."
"Properties of arithmetic norms of integers are applied to the study of arithmetic BN modulo A codes. Some new properties of such codes are established. Bounds on the size of such codes are derived and an efflcient algorithm for finding the optimal single and double error-correcting BN modulo A codes is developed."
"A computer program was written and executed to search for better lower bounds to Rado's noncomputable sigma and shift functions for binary Turing machines. Former results in this search (called by Rado the Busy Beaver logical game) are reviewed and new bounds found by this program are presented."
"In digital integrated circuits (IC's) a synchronous binary-rate multiplier is commercially available, generating a programmable number of output pulses during each internal counting cycle having a length equal to a power of two. These output pulses are not equally divided over that fixed internal counting cycle and the generated binary rate has a fixed denominator. In this note a new type of binary-rate multiplier is described. This circuit allows the programming of both numerator a and denominator b of the rate of the numbers of output and input pulses. It operates in such a way that during a cycle of b pulses the circuit output generates a number of pulses divided over the cycle of b pulses as equally divided as is possible in digital systems."
"A model to estimate the bandwidth and interference in an interleaved memory system in a multiprocessor system is described. The model allows queuing on busy modules, and the results obtained show that previous results are rather pessimistic."
"This note describes the determination of waveform segments which contain the information necessary for classification. The method is successful in discriminating between the vibration record of internal combustion engines before and after repair."
"Certain arrangements of local features in a scene tend to group together and to be seen as units. It is suggested that, in some instances, this phenomenon might be interpretable as a process of cluster detection in a graph-structured space derived from the scene. This idea is illustrated using a class of line-drawing ``scenes'' that contain only horizontal and vertical line segments."
"A bound is derived on the number of low-weight sequences an L-step observable nonsingular-autonomous finite-state machine is capable of producing."
"A new approach for the realization of multithreshold threshold elements is presented. The procedure is based on the fact that the excitations at contradictory vertices of the switching function must be unequal. The weights of the multithreshold element, in general, satisfy simple relations of the form U·W = 0, where U=(u1, u2, ... , un) and W=(w1, w2, ... , wn) such that ui ∈{1,0, -1,}, i=1,2, ... n, and W∈In. Comparison of the excitations E(Xi) = W·Xi and E(Xj) = W·XjM at TRUE, and FALSE vertices Xi and Xj, respectively, for all specified vertices reusult in some inequalities of the form U·W≠0. Subsets of the remaining set of weight expressions U·W that are compatible are then determined, i.e., no linear combination of some or all of these expressions results in an expression Ui·W such that Ui·W≠0 and independent of each other. Each expression of each of these subsets is then equated to zero, and simple relations between weights are established. These are then used to find the weights vectors W's. The threshold vector T for each W is next established. From the set of weight-threshold vectors (W, T) the desired solution is determined by some minimality criterion. An example has been worked out by hand and an algorithm is given for systematic synthesis procedure."
"A method is presented that combines the multiplexing and A/D function to eliminate analog multiplexing switches."
"A simple method for the implementation of Booth's algorithm for multiplication of signed binary numbers has been presented. It has been shown that for large word lengths, a significant economy has been achieved compared to Majithia and Kitai's method."

 "George A. Bekey has asked to be relieved of his duties as Associate Editor for Get this TRANSACTIONS in order to be able to devote more of his time to research and writing. Dr. Bekey has served the Society well in this capacity for four years, and has been primarily responsible for the stimulation and evaluation of the many good papers on analog-hybrid computers, simulation, modeling, and applications of computers. On behalf of the Society and myself, I want to express sincere appreciation for his good efforts in carrying out this demanding task. I am pleased to announce that Professor Robert E. Vichnevetsky of Rutgers University has become the new Associate Editor for this important area, and has been serving in this capacity since July 1, 1972. The applications areas of computers, particularly the simulation and modeling of large-scale systems, continues to receive more and more emphasis in research and development efforts, and Dr. Vichnevetsky is particularly well qualified to continue the vigorous monitoring of publications activities in these fields. We welcome Dr. Vichnevetsky to the Editorial Board of this TRANSACTIONS and wish him every success in the important and demanding editorial tasks in this area."
"Experimental models for a line printer and a terminal printer have been constructed, making use of intensity-modulated ink jets for the recording of characters on untreated paper at a speed of 24 lines/s and 50 characters/s, respectively. The characters are printed on the matrix principle, using matrices of 10X16 and 5X7 formed by one oscillating ink jet. The nozzles producing the jets are oscillated by means of an electromagnet or a piezoelectric crystal. The terminal printer can be used as a normal typewriter as well as for automatic printout from a computer. As the printers contain few moving mechanical parts, their noise level is very low."
"A hierarchical model of computer organizations is developed, based on a tree model using request/service type resources as nodes. Two aspects of the model are distinguished: logical and physical. General parallel- or multiple-stream organizations are examined as to type and effectiveness-especially regarding intrinsic logical difficulties. The overlapped simplex processor (SISD) is limited by data dependencies. Branching has a particularly degenerative effect. The parallel processors [single-instruction stream-multiple-data stream (SIMD)] are analyzed. In particular, a nesting type explanation is offered for Minsky's conjecture-the performance of a parallel processor increases as log M instead of M (the number of data stream processors). Multiprocessors (MIMD) are subjected to a saturation syndrome based on general communications lockout. Simplified queuing models indicate that saturation develops when the fraction of task time spent locked out (L/E) approaches 1/n, where n is the number of processors. Resources sharing in multiprocessors can be used to avoid several other classic organizational problems."
"The doubly chained tree structure is an efficient device for organizing a file that must be searched and updated frequently. This paper considers a variation to the doubly chained tree which is more representative of a file in which the data is partitioned into blocks or pages. In this model the cost of searching the next node is 1 if the node is reachable from the same root (i.e., on the same page), and is k if the next node is the next root (i. e., on a different page). An algorithm for constructing doubly chained trees having any number of terminal nodes N, with minimal average search length, is developed. A simple closed expression is derived for the minimum average search time as a function of the number of terminal nodes N and the parameter k. A proof of optimality is also included."
"A family of nonparametric clustering criteria has been previously proposed by the authors. One particular member of this family was subjected to analysis and experimentation. This criterion was shown by heuristic argument, experimentation, and approximate asymptotic analysis to exhibit ``valley-seeking'' behavior. In this paper, we consider a more general class of valley-seeking criteria. The results bear a close resemblance to Parzen's theory of probability density estimation. This similarity is exploited to develop sufficient conditions for a criterion to be valley seeking in the asymptotic sense."
"The logical organization of a programmable cellular array is presented and discussed. This array is a two-dimensional array of identical cells, each of which can be programmed to one of 12 functional states. It is shown that by appropriate selection of the cell states, a useful class of microprograms can be realized with the array. The realization of a microprogram consists of two steps. First, each of the microinstructions of the program are implemented in a row of the array. Second, the control structure of the microprogram is realized by using some of the cells at the left end of each row to generate the control signals for the row."
"Universal base functions (UBF's) which are generalizations of universal logic functions are defined. An (n, m, r)-UBF can be implemented as a single module (UBM) with n+m inputs and 1 output. An arbitrary n-variable switching function fn (X) is then realized on the fixed UBM by realizing a suitable set of m r-variable functions with which to drive m inputs of the UBM, the remaining n inputs being driven by X. The fan-in of a UBM for r ≥2 is shown to be considerably less than that of a universal logic module (a special case corresponding to r = 1). Specific UBF's are proposed for r = 2 in which m is on the order of 60 percent of the value obtained by using the UBF defined by the familiar Shannon decomposition formula. This is close to the theoretical lower bound on m. The use of UBM's provides a new way to realize an arbitrary function or set of functions, completely specified or otherwise, by assembling a small number of circuits selected from a small set of standard logic modules of limited fan-in. For the case r = 2, the number of two-input devices required to drive the m inputs of the UBM is often considerably less than m. DON'T CARES can be used to advantage to reduce this number still further."
"A cubical representation for multivalued switching functions, which is very convenient for digital computer processing, is presented. A p-valued switching function of n variables is represented by an array of cubes. Each cube is composed of a logical co-efficient and n coordinates with each coordinate represented by p bits. A set of operators for multivalued logic design (such as sharp, union, etc.) for manipulating arrays of cubes is defined and used for minimizing multivalued switching functions. The idea of ``compound literals'' is introduced, which yields a realization with less hardware than the existing methods. Algorithms for finding all prime implicants, essential prime implicants, and a near-minimum cover for multivalued switching functions are presented that are suitable for both computer and hand execution. These algorithms have been programmed in Fortran."
"The well-known pattern search method has been randomized by Lawrence and Steiglitz [4] in order to augment its ability to adapt to direction. In this note we introduce other refinements in order to make it more adaptive in step size, and the use of penalty terms is incorporated as so to accommodate constraints. This yields an algorithm that appears to be robust and reliable, as verified by numerical experimentation. Moreover, the method has low storage requirements and is insensitive to the initial choice of a search radius."
"The generalized Reed-Muller expansions of a switching function are generated using a single Boolean matrix and step-by-step shifting of the principal column."
"An algorithm for tracing during garbage collection of list structure is presented. It requires only one bit for each level of doubly branching structure traced. Compared to existing trace algorithms, it generally requires less storage-often, substantially less."
"The technique of using nonlinear resistances to terminate interconnecting transmission lines has been designed and tested, and is recommended for use in very high-speed digital circuits. This technique can save power, simplify wiring, and eliminate the problem of ringing in branched networks. Line matching by nonlinear resistance is investigated theoretically, and the properties, possibilities, and limitations of this method are discussed. Schottky diodes are recommended for this purpose."
"A test generation system, developed for the logic boards of the Illiac IV computer, is described. The system combines the test generation by random patterns and the D-algorithm. Some results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach."
"Large-scale scientific computers are characterized by having a high ratio of computing requirements to the input-output requirements. Thus the speed of arithmetic operations should be of prime importance in this group of digital computers. In this note a mathematical formula is derived to determine the multiplication time obtained by each of the known high-speed multiplication techniques. Then a comparative analysis is performed to show the amount of speed improvement resulting from each technique and the influence of the different factors affecting speed."
"A theorem is presented that simplifies the computations necessary for complementing a Boolean function."
"A cellular array is described that is capable of extracting either the square or the square root of a binary number. The mode of operation is controlled by a single-mode input line. The array is iterative in its connection pattern and is therefore suitable for large-scale integrated (LSI) implementation. Approximate time-delay expressions are derived, which show that the delays for square or square-root extraction are comparable to the, delay of published array networks."
"A simple extension of Ghazala's technique yields a useful criterion of essentiality of a multiple output prime implicant. Use of such a criterion can simplify the subsequent logic minimization procedure."
"A signal flow graph is given and a corresponding Fortran program for the Haar-Fourier transform is described. The algorithm performs N - 1 additions and N - 1 subtractions on input data, N being the data number."
    "A new measure of dependence is formulated, and some of its properties are described. The measure is applied to feature evaluation to show the relation of dependence between features and classes to discrimination between class-conditional probability distributions."

 "The first 50 years of broadcasting have seen sweeping and rapid changes, and radio and television receivers are now standard pieces of domestic equipment. The next 50 years will see the move to higher frequencies continue, and cable television will continue to grow. Newspapers, as we know them, might well be replaced by a broadcast-printed newspaper"
 "Direct satellite broadcasting to the home receiver could overcome the problems of providing 100% television coverage to hilly or rural areas without the expense of providing extra transmitters or wired distribution systems"
"Only a decade ago videotape machines cost tens of thousands of pounds and film-recording equipment was only slightly cheaper. Holography was an unknown word in television circles and it seemed impossible to record 625-line colour signals on a disc.

 "A mathematical model is established for the reliability of modularly redundant systems with unequal failure rates for the operating and standby units. The failure modes include failures of the active and standby units, three types of switch failures, and failures on system recovery. System reliability is considered for cases of both similar and dissimilar units, and for various restrictions on the failure parameters. It is shown that the most important failure parameters are those related to catastrophic failures, and that putting more reliable units as basic units, which operate initially, is important when switches and recovery are imperfect."
"Guidelines are presented for structuring a reliability model where detailed failure modes are considered explicitly and where no assumption of statistical independence is made between the failure modes. An electronic circuit is considered. Part and interface characteristics, performance attribute and stress equations, and conditional reliability relationships are fitted together. Pertinent features are illustrated with examples. A composite reliability prediction equation in functional notation is presented. The required information is the same type which is used for separately treating detailed failure modes. However, this information needs to be accurate to warrant a model with statistical dependence, and this would be difficult. Numerical calculations are tedious and expensive, even where computerized. Experimental applications are necessary to determine if this detailed reliability prediction model has anything practical to offer."
"In part I empirical Bayes estimation procedures are introduced and employed to obtain an estimator for the unknown random scale parameter of a two-parameter Weibull distribution with known shape parameter. In part II, procedures are developed for estimating both the random scale and shape parameters. These estimators use a sequence of maximum likelihood estimates from related reliability experiments to form an empirical estimate of the appropriate unknown prior probability density function. Monte Carlo simulation is used to compare the performance of these estimators with the appropriate maximum likelihood estimator. Algorithms are presented for sequentially obtaining the reduced sample sizes required by the estimators while still providing mean squared error accuracy compatible with the use of the maximum likelihood estimators. In some cases whenever the prior pdf is a member of the Pearson family of distributions, as much as a 60% reduction in total test units is obtained. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the procedures."

"An iterative procedure is given for joint maximum likelihood estimation of the three parameters of the Weibull population. For this population, the likelihood function is forned and the maximum likelihood equations are obtained. Simultaneous solution of these equations yields joint maximum likelihood estimators for the three parameters. The proposed iterative procedure is a modified quasilinearization algorithm for solving nonlinear equations with bounded variables. Numerical results are given in which the parameters are estimated from real and from simulated life test data drawn from the Weibull population."
"A comterm map method permits machine computation of the probability of occurrence of the event associated with the output for each logic gate of a multistate logic tree. The method is general and applies to any tree configuration, except where feedback occurs from higher to lower gates. Any state of two or more mutually exclusive component states may be used one or more times as primary inputs to the logic gates. The method usually requires much less memory than a minterm or Karnaugh map method by providing map space for only those selected components called ``common.''"
"A method has been developed for applying bilinear transformations to the identification of faulty components in linear electronic circuits. Simple magnitude and phase measurements, at a number of test frequencies, are made and plotted on a set of predetermined loci in the complex transfer-function plane. The data for plotting the loci are determined either experimentally or by circuit analysis with a digital computer. The faulty component and the parameter value are then determined from the loci. The method has the advantage that it provides a graphical representation of the circuit behavior with a faulty component and also readily allows experimental error to be taken into account when plotting the measured data. The method is demonstrated with a practical transistor amplifier circuit."
"This paper presents a brief review of a conditional test for the equality of parameters for two negative binomial populations, provides a set of fairly extensive tables of critical values for the test, and gives a new approximation for estimating probabilities outside the range of the tables."
"Relatively simple approaches to estimating Weibull parameters for a general class of devices are developed through regression models. It is assumed that data are collected on a number of device types belonging to a general class. For each device type, the only information available is the number of devices being observed, the total time observed and the total number of failures. By assuming a constant shape parameter and a scale parameter that may vary with the characteristics of the device-type, the least squares method is used to provide estimates of the parameters of a two-parameter Weibull distribution for both replacement and nonreplacement data. An approach is also suggested for dealing with troublesome cases of zero failure occurrences. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the approach."

"The rudiments of Bayesian philosophy are introduced, and the mathematics of its application are surveyed; there is no uniformity of thought concerning either. The more extreme Bayesian philosophy, which allows subjective probabilities, is a means of plausible reasoning, or of making inferences, through inductive logic. Because inferences concerning reliability concepts are important in the decision process, this philosophy has a place in the reliability field. The difficulties of interpreting the probability function and of assigning prior distributions restrict the presentation of a unified philosophy. Thus, only techniques for describing prior probabilities under various circumstances can be given. Application of the Bayesian approach depends on how the reliability decision is conceptualized."
"The rudiments of applying Bayes' Equation to hypotheses concerning reliability are introduced in a simple manner. The application is a means of obtaining posterior probabilities, for the reliability hypotheses, which are consistent with the prior beliefs and the available test results. The posterior distributions, from which decision theory could formally arrive at optimal estimates, are greatly dependent on the prior distributions. Thus, the discussion centers about the desired properties of a prior and its effects on the posterior for various data situations. Formulations for both continuous-conjugate and discrete representations of the prior beliefs are discussed and contrasted. The use of discrete priors offers many advantages over the use of continuous-conjugate priors."
"This paper describes methods of fitting prior distributions to equipment MTBF = θ, shows the priors fitted to different equipments, establishes data criteria for fitting prior distributions to θ, and presents the results of a robustness analysis performed on the fitted priors. Systematic procedures for fitting priors are shown for Type 1 data (number of failures in fixed time T) and Type 2 data (observed MTBF, number of failures not the same for all equipments), and specific data criteria, in the form of minimum values of n (number of equipments) and K (number of failures) are presented. The inverted-gamma prior-distributions were derived from operational failure data obtained from Tinker AFB. The equipments are primarily electronic, therefore, the time-to-failure distribution was assumed to be exponential; however, the methods are generally applicable whatever the form of the conditional distribution. The robustness analysis shows the effects of errors in estimating the parameters of the prior on the posterior distribution. In general, the effect of errors in estimating parameters of the prior was practically negligible for large values of K."
"A Bayesian reliability estimation technique known as the ``empirical Bayes approach'' is developed which uses previous experience nce to get a Bayesian point estimator. The techniques require no knowledge of the form of the unknown prior distribution and are robust to assumptions about its form. Empirical Bayes techniques are applicable to situations in which prior, independent observations of the random variable X from the random couple (Θ, X) are available where Θ is the observed parameter of interest distributed in accordance with the unknown prior distribution. Performance comparisons of the empirical Bayes and other well established techniques are developed by examples for the binomial, exponential, Normal, and Poisson situations which often occur in reliability problems. In all cases the empirical Bayes estimator performed better than the classical estimator in minimizing the average squared error."
"A two-parameter Weibull distribution is assumed to be the appropriate statistical life-model of an engineering device. The hazard rate of this device is the relevant quantity in terms of which statistical decisions are to be made. A Bayesian decision model is constructed around a conjugate probability density function for the Weibull hazard rate. Prior, posterior, and preposterior analysis of this decision model are discussed. The results indicate the rational decision before and after sampling, and permit the optimization of sequential single-item sampling schemes. Such schemes are of particular importance in the reliability testing of high-cost equipment."
"An important problem facing a manufacturer is the determination of the amount of time to burn-in items (in order to eliminate early failures) and the age at which to replace items (to avoid failures due to wearout). This problem becomes difficult to solve if the time-to-failure distribution of an item is unknown and must be estimated from test and operational data. This paper describes a method of statistical data analysis which is readily applied to the solution of this decision problem under a realistic but general loss (or gain) function. The method is a multiparameter Bayesian analysis which requires multiple integration of the (multivariate) posterior of the parameters of the time-to-failure distribution to obtain the expected loss (or gain) resulting from a particular choice of burn-in time and item replacement age. This integration is performed by a Monte Carlo Procedure using importance sampling. An example demonstrates the flexibility of this method of analysis. The data are a mixture of ``point'' and truncated data, which often create difficulties when using conventional methods of decision analysis. In addition, since the method permits up to ten parameters for the family of time-to-failure distributions, a ``bathtub'' hazard rate function is used to generate the data for the example. The results are presented in the form of Bayesian confidence intervals for the true hazard rate function and a presentation of the expected loss as a function of burn-in time and age at replacement."
"This tutorial paper shows, via an example, how optimum sampling plans can be derived using Bayesian decision theory. Both nonsequential and sequential sampling plans are described. The Bayesian method is contrasted with classical methods. The salient difference between Bayesian and classical methods is that the Bayesian approach allows one formally to pose and answer the question: ``How many should I test?''."
"Experience with two methods of Bayesian reliability measurement is described. An aerospace subsystem was evaluated assuming continuous gamma-distributed component failure rates. Priors were developed by conventional reliability prediction methods based on handbook data. The ``strength'' of the prior was expressed in terms of variance about a predicted mean. Comparative evaluation was also made by a classical technique during a test program extending over 10 months. The Bayesian method was preferred though problems inherent in the method were apparent. More recently, a complex marine system was evaluated over a one-year period using a Bayesian formulation in which the failure rate is described by a discrete probability distribution with nonuniform cell widths. This technique avoids some of the operational problems of continuous formulations. Experience with Bayesian methods leaves little doubt of their utility as evaluation tools. The philosophical problems, however, remain as intransigent as ever."
"There appear to be two important developing trends in reliability. One is away from the use of statistics by reliability engineers; the other is toward increased use of Bayesian techniques. One source of the latter may be disillusionment with what is regarded as classical statistics; however, one source of the former may be dissatisfaction with what has been called Bayesian statistics. The purpose of this paper is to discuss these trends and to present a personal view of the issues between classical and Bayesian statistics. The objective is to show that there is some substance to the classical statistician's opposition to Bayesian inference and that the issues are pertinent and meaningful to the reliability engineer."

   "The nonredundant transistorized repeaters used in undersea cable systems are intended to operate on the ocean floor without maintenance for twenty years. To provide the best possible assurance that this high level of reliability is in fact attained, semiconductor transistors and diodes manufactured for cable use are screened to identify and eliminate the early failures. Devices surviving the screening are then subjected, for at least six months, to real time aging which simulates the worst-case use-conditions. The devices are removed from the aging environment and certain of the devices are selected for use in undersea cable operation. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss the empirically derived procedures for selecting two types of semiconductor diodes. The test data on which the selection is based consist, in each case, of period measurements of four electrical parameters while the diodes are aging. There was apparently no accepted and well formulated statistical model for the data on which a conventional technique could be based. Thus more unconventional procedures for device selection had to be constructed. The selection procedures have been implemented and perform well."
"The direct method in sequential analysis is used for an exact analysis of the Method-One maintainability demonstration plan in MIL-STD-471. Method-One is a nonparametric binomial sequential test and consists of three plans: A, B1, B2."
"A Bayes analysis of system availability A is carried out on the basis of snapshot data obtained on each of the N component subsystems. Application of Bayes formula, using a natural conjugate prior probability density function (pdf), yields the posterior pdf of subsystem availability. Determination of the posterior pdf of system availability requires the derivation of the pdf of the product of N independent random variables, which is accomplished through the use of the Mellin integral transform. From the knowledge of the posterior pdf of A, confidence limits on system availability can be obtained."
"The computation of reliability becomes quite tedious when one has to deal with a non series-parallel system. In this paper a proposed method is developed by taking the system as a probabilistic graph in which a component of the system is represented by a branch. The proposed method is composed of three phases: Phase 1 involves the reduction of all series, parallel, and series-parallel components to an irreducible non series-parallel system. In Phase 2 the algorithm enumerates all possible paths from the source to the sink of the graph. Phase 3 then computes the system reliability based on the path information obtained in Phase 2. An example of the use of the method to compute system reliability is given."
"This paper proposes a methodology for optimizing resource allocations within a real-time information system, given the availability constraints. In essence, the methodology reformulates the availability constraints into a state transition matrix. The state probabilities, computed from the transition matrix, form a portion of the input to the optimizing algorithm. This algorithm optimizes an arbitrary objective function of system resources, subject to the reformulated availability constraints."
"In general, a small proportion of components will be substandard because of some imperfection in the control of the production process. Because no advance knowledge exists as to which are the substandard components, their presence affects the reliability. A great part of the substandard components can be eliminated by means of debugging procedures, but due to a nonzero proportion of defectives of the component population, it is impossible to eliminate all of the substandard components through conventional debugging processes. To remedy this drawback, this paper presents a new debugging process that is capable of eliminating almost all of the substandard components. From an analysis and comparison of the new debugging process with the conventional method, it has become evident that we can reduce the fraction defective of the lot after debugging by several orders of magnitude when compared with the conventional method."
"A mathematical model is formulated for optimizing the reliability of a system subject to given linear constraints; the system has several stages in series; each stage has parallel redundancy to improve the reliability. Part I shows a new way to transform the model of constrained optimization to a saddle point problem by using Lagrange multipliers. Conditions are derived for maximizing the reliability function; Newton's method is used to solve the resulting multidimensional nonlinear algebraic equations. Further modifications are provided to avoid inverting the large Jacobian matrices; therefore this method is practical for large systems. Part II shows how to transform the model of constrained optimization to a multistage decision process and uses the Maximum principle to arrive at the optimal decision. This approach is easy to apply, formulate, and program. The solution can be obtained without fear of nonconvergence (very often experienced with earlier methods) besides providing considerable saving in computer time. Design alternatives can be easily considered."
"The impact, on system reliability and availability, of periodic testing with imperfect test equipment is analyzed. The proportion of the system tested, the frequency of testing, the accuracy of the tests, and the reliability of the test equipment are considered. The bivariate normal probability distribution is used to assess the effects of test equipment accuracy. A recursion model is developed to assess the impact of test equipment unreliability."
"A technique is developed for finding the time dependent operating probabilities used by reliability systems designers for provisioning a system with N + k identical units, k of which are called spares and N called operating units, and s repair facilities. System failure occurs when less than N units are operational. Units fail with exponential interfailure times and are repaired with exponential service time. Idle spares fail due to deterioration at a rate possibly different from that of the operating units. Graphs are presented which show the minimum numbers of spares needed to achieve system reliabilities of 0.90 and 0.99 as a function of time. The technique is applicable for finding, numerically, the first passage time distribution for any system modeled by birth and death processes."

   "In this paper, graphical methods are presented for analyzing accelerated life test data with the inverse power law model, when all test units are run to failure. The inverse power law model is described, and graphical methods for estimating its parameters from such complete data are given. These methods are illustrated with accelerated test data on time to breakdown of an insulating fluid. While the methods are presented with the inverse power law model, they can be used for analyzing many other accelerated life test situations. These methods are presented so that they can be used by individuals with a limited statistical background."
"This paper presents information on the reliability of MOS integrated circuits based on p-channel enhancement-mode transistors, and describes their failure modes and mechanisms. The principal failure mechanisms were ion migration at the surface and oxide shorting. The results of experimental studies of the effects of variations in construction, processing, and levels of stress are presented, and are compared with other available information on MOS integrated circuit reliability. The failure rate for commercially available complex MOS arrays is on the order of 0.001 to 0.01 per 1000 h of operating life at 125°C for arrays containing approximately 600 p-channel transistors. This corresponds to a failure rate on the order of 5 × 10-6 to 5 × 10-5 per equivalent gate per 1000 h. The effects of device complexity, operating temperature, and other factors are discussed. A reliability prediction equation for MOS integrated circuits is derived from available information. An overall activation energy for functional failure mechanisms of approximately 5 kcal/mole (≈0.2 eV/molecule) is considered applicable to typical MOS integrated circuits. Thus, the failure rate of MOS devices operated at 50°C ambient temperature can be predicted to be on the order of 10-6 to 10-5 per equivalent gate per 1000 h."
"A standby-redundant repairable system having only two units and an imperfect switchover is considered. The Lapace-Stieltjes transform of the distribution of the time to first system faflure (TFSF) and the mean TFSF are derived. Numerical comparisons of the mean TFSF with both perfect and imperfect switching are made. All time distributions, except repair of the main units, are exponential."
"We consider a standby-redundant model of two units, where we assume that one unit is operative and the other unit is in standby at time t = 0. If the operative unit fails, a unit in standby is put into preventive maintenance policy of the operative unit to maintain our the preventive maintenance policy of the operative unit to maintain our system with high reliability. Our concern for the system is the time to the first system-down. The Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the time distribution to the first system-down and the mean time to the first system-down are derived by applying the relationship between Markov renewal processes and signal flow graph. Further, the behavior after the system-down is investigated by using the results of Markov renewal processes. Finally, numerical examples are presented for the k-Erlang failure time distributions. The optimal preventive maintenance time is discussed."
"This paper provides a simple algorithm for the solution of the redundancy optimization problem in the presence of multiple linear constraints. Basicaily, the solution to an r-constraint problem is obtained successively from the solution of r-unconstrained problems. At each step, an active constraint is picked out, then the maximum gradient concept is used to find a closer point. The approach requires minimum effort and time for solution."
"A branch and bound algorithm is extended to parallel standby redundancy wherein components are subject to both open and short circuit failures. The algorithm is then modified to consider parallel-series arrangememts of such standbys, and is also applied to solving problems where there is a choice of components at each stage. In the last section, the two types of failures are separated in the constraints of the problems."
"We present a procedure for the generation of cost-minimized designs of circuits and systems. Suppose a designer has decided upon the topology of his product. Also suppose he knows the cost and quality of the different grades of the N components required to implement the product. The designer then faces the following problem: How should he proceed to find the combination of grades that will give him the desired manufacturing yield at minimum product cost? We discuss the problem and suggest a policy by which the designer, with a reasonable computational effort, can find a set of ``good'' implementations. The suggested policy is applied to an electronic amplifier. The results are quite encouraging."
"Monte Carlo simulations are used to investigate the maximum likelihood estimators for the parameters of the Weibull distribution using multicensored samples. For the case of unequal number of items censored, a single situation is considered. When the same number of items are removed at each test, several different estimators are compared for several values of the parameters."
"For life testing procedures, a Bayesian analysis is developed with respect to a random intensity parameter in the Poisson distribution. Bayes estimators are derived for the Poisson parameter and the reliability function based on uniform and gamma prior distributions of that parameter. A Monte Carlo procedure is implemented to make possible an empirical mean-squared error comparison between Bayes and existing minimum variance unbiased, as well as maximum likelihood, estimators. As expected, the Bayes estimators have mean-squared errors that are appreciably smaller than those of the other two."
"The evaluation of system reliability becomes very diffilcult when the number of components in a system is large or the system configuration is complex. This note presents a straightforward method for system reliability evaluation. Probability is treated as a point in a Cartesian frame and formulas are derived to evaluate the reliability of series, parallel, series-parallel, and bridge networks. The values obtained by the classical method agree closely with those obtained by this parametric method."
"This tutorial paper presents the problem of optimal allocation of parallel redundancy under multiple linear constraints by the method of dynamic programming. The problem is approached with a standard dynamic programming formulation; the concept of dominating system configurations is introduced to reduce the number of computations involved; and a simple procedure is presented. Solutions to three numerical examples are presented."

  "This two-part tutorial article describes properties and applications of magnetically soft ferrites. These materials, which are characterized by high permeability and low losses, are used in very large quantities as cores for inductors and transformers. This first installment provides an elementary introduction to the processes of magnetization in ferrites. It also includes a survey of available grades and a summary of the technical properties of typical modern ferrites. Part II, to appear in February, reviews the main applications, describing how the material properties and performance requirements come together in the design of the device."
"Time was when scientists and engineers were among the world's insurgents, daring to question the established order-the church-and to undermine its teachings by their theories and experiments. But the pendulum has swung, as pendulums do, and today the scientific community finds itself on the side of the establishment, in an age when ``establishment'' has become a ``dirty word.'' Now science once again must take the initiative; scientists must recognize that, having participated in the breakdown of our traditional code of ethics, they must offer man an alternative, a new morality to live by, in its place."
"The National Study of Mathematics Requirements for Scientists and Engineers, a project supported by the Office of Education, U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, was conducted in order to evaluate the numerous mathematics courses considered desirable for scientists and engineers. Subsequent work, here reported, has concentrated on an attempt to increase the value of the findings by means of a further study in which the electrical engineering discipline was broken down into a number of typical subspecializatons. Eight of the largest of the 35 categories that are covered by the IEEE Group-Society structure were included in the sample."

"The occasion of the 25th anniversary of the Northeast Electronics Research and Engineering Meeting provided an opportunity to review the progress of the electronics industry during NEREM's 25-year history. Those years produced the transistor and the integrated circuit, electronic data processing, and the ultrareliable systems of electronic telemetry, computation, control, and communication that guided man to the moon and back. A study of certain developments during this period suggests a bright future for electronics."
"Sleepless nights face the data-processing manager who attempts to identify the many destructive fates that can await his computer center: fraud, hardware and software failures, operator errors, input errors, programming errors, magnetic erasure, electromagnetic and acoustic monitoring . . . Hardware and software techniques to prevent such disasters as leakage of private information, penetration of a computerized information center, and the alteration or destruction of a data base are surveyed in this article. Areas of concern include remote-terminal access, cryptography, the communication subsystem, threat monitoring, processing controls, certification, and the internal audit."
"New trends are developing in the United States' supply of scientific and engineering manpower. Students appear to be losing interest in science and engineering; at the same time, there is concern about an over-supply of Ph.D.'s. Underlying this oversupply is a disturbing fact of life: In the 1970s, the universities and the defense and space industries will have very limited need for new Ph.D.'s. The situation calls for an agonizing reexamination and reorientation of both the content of and attitudes toward the Ph.D. degree."
"An improved Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) system has been adopted by the International Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR).* It was implemented internationally by the standard frequency and time broadcast stations on January 1, 1972. The new UTC system eliminates the frequency offset of 300 parts in 1010 between the old UTC and Atomic Time, thus making the broadcast time interval, the UTC second, constant and defined by the resonant frequency of cesium atoms. The new time scale will be kept in synchronism with the rotation of the earth within ±0.7 second by step-time adjustments of exactly 1 second, when needed. A time code will be added to the disseminated time signals that will permit Universal Time to be obtained from the broadcasts to the nearest 0.1 second for users requiring such precision."

 "Dozens of research workers in more than a hundred leading laboratories of the world are working on creating the foundations for a new field of engineering that promises to have a revolutionary impact on almost every field of science and technology. Resulting from the introduction of a variety of new techniques and devices-including the laser-as well as from the development of new photo-sensitive and electron-beam recording materials-including thermoplastics, codable films, and mass-storage holographic memories-this new technology, known as optical computing, is based upon mathematical concepts known as coherent or Fourier optics and holography. In terms of future developments and applications, the most dramatic results very likely will emerge from the implementation of real-time image processing in various forms. But the great power of optical computing derives primarily from its newly recognized capability of parallel processing, a natural property of the lens! In a general way, all aspects of this new field can be characterized by established concepts of electric and electronic signal processing and communications."

   "The final installment of this article focuses on the applications and performance requirements of soft ferrite materials. Basic devices employing ferrites include inductors for FDM filters, wide-band and pulse transformers, and high-frequency power transformers. In the typical modern television receiver a total of about 0.6 kg of ferrite cores is used in a variety of applications, such as line output transformers, deflection yokes, and convergence systems."
"A year in the making, this report has just been released by a special IEEE ad hoc committee. The committee was charged in late 1970 with finding out what the IEEE was already doing in applying technology to social problems, determining what new efforts would be desirable, and how all of the individual and group efforts could best be coordinated. Chief among the suggestions of the committee is the development of procedures by which IEEE interest can be expressed and its support offered to governments and other appropriate organizations."
"In an innovative program Dartmouth engineering students are sent to Jersey City, where they spend a term divided between teaching and performing an engineering task within the city administration. They help to coach inner-city high school seniors in the material of the ``Man-Made World,'' and teach them the computer language, Basic, together with hands-on operation of a terminal connected to a time-sharing computer system. They also evaluate and help to develop methods for improving the operations of municipal offices and functions that come under the control of the Jersey City government. The program is designed to give the student a foretaste of the challenges he will face as an engineer once he leaves the cloistered halls of learning for the real world."
"A long-standing expert on electric-shock hazards summarizes the studies that determined the effective body impedance under varying conditions. He describes perception currents, reaction currents, let-go currents, and fibrillating currents. Turning to means for reducing low-voltage (120-240-volt) hazards, double insulation, shock limitation, isolation transformers, and the use of either high frequency or direct current are discussed for various environments. Macroshock is always a hazard in the home, in industry, and in the hospital. But the extreme vulnerability to microshock of patients with cardiac catheters, for example, requires special precautions in intensive-care and coronary-care units. Equipment such as the ground-fault interrupter (GFI) and a special isolation transformer are cited."

"Rail signal systems have traditionally been employed to prevent collision of trains while permitting them to adhere to a schedule that is adequate for moving passengers and/or freight. In today's rapid-transit systems, however, the corollary objectives of a signal system-namely, controlling the speed of trains, increasing the capacity of the line, and minimizing schedule disruptions caused by transient disturbances in train operations-are critical to providing satisfactory service to passengers."
"The subjects of R&D and manufacturing technologies presently at hand to advance the widespread acceptance of underground transmission were among the concerns of a recent five-day Engineering Foundation conference at New England College, Henniker, N.H. The seminar was cosponsored by a committee of the Electrical Research Council, the Department of the Interior, and the Construction Research Committee of the ASCE (in cooperation with the Insulated Conductors Committee of the IEEE). Lester H. Fink of the Philadelphia Electric Company and T. W. Mermel of the Bureau of Reclamation, Department of the Interior, were the cochairmen. More than 100 representatives from electric utilities, electric equipment manufacturers and suppliers, and government agencies attended the week-long symposium. The parallel purpose of the conference was to stimulate the development and evaluation of innovative and practical techniques that could contribute meaningfully to the progress and optimization of both the present and future technology in high-voltage buried lines. Areas of research to reduce the cost of installing underground transmission were identified, and there were exchanges of ideas and concepts toward achieving this goal."

 "Operating over a frequency range from audio to ultraviolet, the modern laser may be the most widely applicable active device at the disposal of today's engineer, enabling him to generate, amplify, modulate, transmit, and detect signals at frequencies more than 10000 times higher than was previously possible. Yet despite the almost unlimited potential for new and exotic applications offered by these shorter wavelengths, innovations have not lived up to their rave notices. Reasons for this relative inertia vary according to the application intended but, in general, it can be predicted that progress in the laser art will accelerate with the improvement of laser efficiency, development of auxiliary systems, and an updating of engineering thinking in terms of finding the ``problems'' that lasers can solve. This first article in a series deals with the laser devices themselves-their advantages and their deficiencies-and will summarize what is happening in the laser art today. Other parts, scheduled to appear in future issues of IEEE SPECTRUM, will cover applications in materials processing, instrumentation and measurement, optical communication, medicine, holography, data processing and storage, displays, and safety."

"The effective use of direct access devices in System/360 was limited by channel and device architecture. Because System/370 was expected to continue with the same dependence on DASD, the problems were defined and solutions were developed. With the assistance of a simulator used during evaluation, the block multiplexer channel proposal was selected. This effort thus provided the basis of the block multiplexer channel and block multiplexing devices that are available today."
"This paper described some of the uses to which the virtual storage systems are being put at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. In addition to these relatively large-scale uses of the systems, a number of people are using the systems primarily, or even exclusively, for editing and document preparation. The interactive nature of these systems commends them to this application, and the presence of powerful editors simplifies it further. To summarize the Research Center experience with interactive virtual storage systems, we can say that when functions exist, users will find ways to exploit them for the solution of their problems. Problems undertaken on a system tend to reflect the functional capabilities of that system, and the ease with which that system can be used. The users at the Research Center have found TSS/360 and CP-67/CMS useful tools in the furtherance of their research goals."
"Evaluation techniques for measuring computing system efficiency continue to be refined as the variety of systems and their applications expand. System measures often tacitly assume that the highest overall efficiency is achieved when a certain critical system parameter, such as throughput, is optimized. Recognizing that these measures may be quite valid when the computing system essentially models the business, this paper does not differ with such criteria. Used in a research environment for supporting individual research workers, however, system measures and policies should attempt to be more flexible, and should strongly consider the human costs and benefits involved. The reason for this is that research projects are so varied that a single system policy may not effectively model the “business” of research. Therefore, we attempt to evaluate and compare system costs and user benefits under a variety of user policies."
"Programming has become a major concern within corporate organizations because programs and programming systems now assist in the day-to-day conduct and management of most corporate activities. Common to all programming departments or groups is the rising cost of program development and maintenance. As a result of this increasing concern, programs and techniques have been formulated to facilitate development of other programs. These programming tools may automate one or more tasks in the programming process, establish libraries of proved programs in the form of macroinstructions and subroutines, or provide assistance in a programming support area susch as program management and documentation."
"Partly by tutorial and partly by example, the use of random number generator techniques for system simulation has been introduced. To gain confidence and to validate results of simulations, comparisons have been made with analytical system performance evaluations. A test of reasonableness and a variation of the problem as a result of the test also illustrate some principles underlying the random number generator simulation method. Even where the results may be inconclusive, the exercise of problem formulation is useful in understanding the system and in determining the next predictive step to take. More elaborate trace-driven or self-driven system simulation is justified when the engineer knows that analytical and random number methods do not produce valid results. As a final caution, one should be aware of the basically cyclic logic that underlies the validations and comparisons. The quantities that one measures against are produced by the indirect methods just as the quantities being measured. There is no independent standard. Thus one should always apply the test of reasonableness. For example, the first results of the example system simulation might lead the unwary engineer to believe that smaller buffers yield higher throughput. This observation being superficially unreasonable, suggests the reimplementation of the problem. If the initial conclusion were generally true, it should be true under the reimplementation. That it is not, confirms us in our skepticism."
  "The technique of encoding verbal information as unique numbers arose from the authors' need for the capability to store and process large quantities of data in a 32K APL workspace. The algorithms, programmed in APL\\360, support several levels or hierarchies of encoding and decoding where associated with each level is its alphabet or wordlist. The first level results in the representation of words as single numbers. Higher levels provide single numbers which can represent phrases, sentences, or paragraphs. Because the encoding process has no finite limit, the implication is that very large quantities of information, such as the amount contained in books or data files, can be represented as single numbers. Perhaps one of the greatest implications for the future is the concept of data compaction where main storage, peripheral storage, and data transmission are optimized."
"The development of analytic models is facilitated by the availability of related discrete-event models. Validation of analytic model results can be achieved by correlation with results from the discrete-event models. Together these models provide complementary vehicles for the evaluation of system performance at various levels of system detail."
"The main objectives of this banking operation—to provide a full check-sorting service to the bank branches and to maintain tight control of the operation- led to the system and, in particular, to the special features just described. The sorting technique provides an improved service to many branches, without the need for time-consuming, off-line sorting. The special access method gives a means of real-time collation of several thousand data set members, enabling the financial accounting operations to be very closely controlled. The restart and recovery methods enable the operation to meet delivery deadlines consistently, in spite of the occasional equipment malfunction which is inevitable on a system of this size."
     "The computer network communications programming discussed in this paper allows users to combine the best aspects of two powerful systems. TSS/360 can be used as a base of operations, taking advantage of the hierarchical storage facility. Data sets can be altered interactively using the editing program, then quickly sent to OS/360 via the NETOS command. Users who work primarily on TSS/360 can take advantage of special features on OS/360 such as language processors or utilities and have the resultant data sets returned and catalogued automatically. Travel time between a scientist's office and the computer installation is minimized, and a user knows instantly when a job has finished, provided data sets are returned to TSS/360 while the scientist is logged on. If they desire, users can enter programs into the Model 67 to be executed in the background."
"The part of a digital computer that performs the useful work is made up of these elements: • Storage facilities • Routing and switching facilities • Data transformation facilities"
"In designing and implementing programs for simulating the Navier-Stokes equations of incompressible viscous flow and for displaying the simulation results, the following features of the System/360 Operating System are particularly useful: • FORTRAN variable-dimensioned arrays • FORTRAN data set sequence numbers • Assembler language in combination with FORTRAN • Execution-time storage allocation • Low-priority program execution in a multiprogramming environment • Multi-data set volumes and multi-volume data sets • Multiprogram sharing of data sets resident in direct-access storage"
"Production programming projects today are often staffed by relatively junior programmers with at most a few years of experience. This condition is primarily the result of the rapid development of the computer and the burgeoning of its applications. Although understandable, such staffing has at least two negative effects on the costs of projects. First, the low average level of experience and knowledge frequently results in less-than-optimum efficiency in programming design, coding, and testing. Concurrently, the more experienced programmers, who have both the insight and knowledge needed to improve this situation, are frequently in second- or third-level management positions where they cannot effectively or economically do the required detailed work of programming."
"The measurement of the use of data processing resources is necessary to allocate the cost of these resources to users. This is becoming more important because the cost of data processing is making up an increasingly larger percentage of each user's budget. Traditional measurements of the cost of data processing resources, such as the full absorption method, are unsuitable because users are not charged according to their actual resource utilization, and because data processing departments are not held accountable for fluctuations caused by efficiencies and inefficiencies of their operations."
  "In this paper, we have discussed some of the salient aspects of virtual storage systems. Further, in the discussions of virtual machines and CP-67, we have illustrated an implementation of a virtual storage system as well as the generalization of the virtual storage concept to virtual machines. Although a virtual machine system does not within its strictly defined limits admit to the more complex uses of virtual storage, it does serve to illustrate the major problems confronted by many virtual storage systems. The utility of the virtual storage and machine concepts is wellestablished, and in the future, the application and extension of these concepts is certain to increase."
"The Model 67 with CP-67 was installed at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft to meet specific requirements of their engineering department that could not be met by a traditional batch computer system. An extensive interactive graphics system, using graphic display consoles, has been developed to assist the engineer and reduce the development cycle time of an engineering design. The interactive programming and job execution facilities provided by CMS have given the engineers and programmers simultaneous computer capabilities at local terminals through the use of virtual machines. The concepts of time-sharing and of virtual machines have certainly proved beneficial for the present applications and will definitely be a valuable tool in implementing many engineering applications in the future."
"The machining of three dimensional objects that embody complex surfaces such as aircraft contours or ship propellers challenges the machine tool numerical control programmer. In industries where automated manufacturing is playing an increasingly important role, product designs often call for physical surfaces that cannot be represented analytically by simple mathematical expressions. An aircraft fuselage or an automobile body, for example, may be conceived in clay, but eventually it is produced in aluminum or steel by methods that demand a numerical representation of the surfaces. With the growth of numerical control, the need has increased to devise analytical techniques for the description of these surfaces, particularly for the application of the techniques to the Automatic Programmed Tool (APT) numerical control processor.1 In fact, the application of APT, the most powerful and widely used numerical control parts programming language to more sophisticated and complex machining requirements, has emphasized the need for a more advanced numerically controlled sculptured surface technology. By sculptured surface is meant the mathematical description of a conceptualized physical surface that requires a process similar to sculpturing to produce."
"A general management game has been described that simulates a manufacturing industry environment and is programmed in an interactive conversational mode using APL. The game has proved to be a valuable means of training individuals in decision-making. Further details are given in Reference 7. The game is also used for experimental purposes, and improvements are being made constantly to reflect the results of research being carried out in the fields of gaming, simulation, and decision-making in an economic environment. To the author's knowledge, this is the first major application of APL in simulation and gaming."
  "This paper presents an analysis of the convergence properties of adaptive transversal equalizers minimizing mean-square distortion. The intention is to reveal the influence on the speed of convergence exerted by the number of taps, the step-size parameter in the adjustment loops, and the spectrum of the unequalized signal. Attention is focused on the convergence of the expected mean-square distortion. Several approximations are made in the analysis, among them the approximation of higher-order statistics by second-order statistical parameters. Comparison with results obtained by computer simulation, however, shows that the theory developed renders a quite accurate picture of the convergence process. Previous work in this field demonstrated the limits set to the speed of convergence by the extreme values of the power spectrum of the unequalized signal. It is shown here that, with regard to the mean-square distortion, the influence of the number of taps will usually dominate by far. The theory provides a simple criterion for convergence and answers the question of how to attain the fastest convergence."
"A new class of automatic equalizers with very fast convergence is discussed in this paper. This fast convergence is accomplished by means of an iterative procedure which successively makes higher-order approximations on the desired equalizer function. The iterative procedure can be conveniently realized in the form of transversal filter stages in cascade. For a given distortion D < 1, the residual distortion at the equalizer output after n iterations can be reduced to no more than the equation in the noise-free cases. When this approach is applied to the feed-forward part of a recursive structure, the front distortion (due to precursors) can be reduced in a similar fashion without unduly increasing the overall distortion. The resulting distortion, mainly in the rear end, can then be cancelled out via feedback paths. Other topics treated include certain generalizations, the truncation error due to limited length in cascaded equalizer sections, and the effect of noise. Several numerical examples are also presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach."
"A simplification and extension to Gordon and Newell's approach to closed queuing networks is derived. The equations, valid for exponential servers, with one server being a multiserver, greatly reduce the computation time required by the former approach. In addition, simplified equations for the details of the queuing network are derived."
"The partitioning problem may be stated as follows: Minimize ∑j=1n cjxj subject to ∑j=1n aijxj = 1, i=1, · · ·, m, where aij and xj are binary numbers. The proposed method consists in solving a new problem equivalent to the original one, the solution of this new problem being obtained by implicit enumeration. Computational experience indicates that this approach yields good results; for example, problems involving several hundred variables were solved in a few seconds."
"When a file is loaded into a direct access storage device using key-to-address transformations, the number and size of storage blocks can be selected. In this study, a selection that minimizes the combined cost of storage space and accesses to the storage device is determined for the case where no record additions or deletions occur after loading."
"Magnetic bubbles offer promise of data storage at a lower cost than is possible using semiconductor technologies. However, a memory using magnetic bubbles is most economically implemented in the form of long shift registers, rather than as a random access storage device. This plus a lower shift rate than is possible with semiconductors suggests relatively long average access times. This shortcoming is largely overcome by an organizational technique called dynamic ordering, which can reduce the average number of shifts needed to access data. A dynamically ordered magnetic bubble memory, when combined with one or more smaller semiconductor memories in a hierarchy, should provide both large capacity and good performance with reasonable economy."
"This communication discusses the engineering considerations involved in the design of low-polluting water-soluble systems for use in mechanized soldering processes. New formulations for water-soluble fluxes, lubricants, and solder masks are described and test data are presented."
"The molar absorption constants of the charge-transfer complexes of PVCz:TNF and of ethylcarbazole:TNF and the respective equilibrium constants for the formation of these complexes in a tetrahydrofuran solution have been determined by absorption measurements. Both materials exhibit two charge-transfer absorption bands. It is shown that these two bands correspond to two transitions of only one charge-transfer complex rather than to two complexes with different geometrical configurations of donor and acceptor molecules. For the PVCz:TNF complex the equilibrium constant is determined as K=0.5 l/mole, which is much smaller than the value K=3.05 l/mole found for the complex of ethylcarbazole and TNF."
"Starting with Maxwell's equations, the transmission line equations are derived for a system consisting of an arbitrary number of conductors. The derivation is rigorous for long lossless conductors embedded in a uniform perfect dielectric. The presentation is essentially tutorial, most of the results being well known, at least for two- and three-conductor systems. The novelty lies in the point of view adopted in obtaining a systematic generalization to the case of an arbitrary number of conductors. Explicit expressions are obtained for the electric and magnetic fields in the dielectric surrounding the conductors, and a rigorous formulation is given for the problem of calculating the coefficients of capacitance and inductance."
"Algorithms for the complete symmetric eigenproblem are studied from the viewpoint of performance in a virtual memory environment. The preferred algorithm is based on tridiagonalization and the implicit QR algorithms. Implementation factors that affect execution time are discussed."

     "It is shown how a relatively simple device can evaluate exponentials, logarithms, ratios and square roots for fraction arguments, employing only shifts, adds, high-speed table lookups, and bit counting. The scheme is based on the cotransformation of a number pair (x,y) such that the F(x,y) = f(x0) is invariant; when x is driven towards a known value xω , y is driven towards the result. For an N-bit fraction about N/4 iterations are required, each involving two or three adds; then a termination algorithm, based on an add and an abbreviated multiply, completes the process, for a total cost of about one conventional multiply time. Convergence, errors and simulation using APL are discussed."
"The extensive use of computers for solving scientific and engineering problems has had a profound effect on the evolution of the mathematical techniques of numerical computation. It has given new impetus to research in numerical integration of differential equations: it has stimulated fresh approaches in the areas of approximation and optimization; and, in general, it has increased interest in numerical methods for the solution of a variety of problems. This special issue of the Journal reports some recent developments and innovations in the computational methods of numerical analysis."
"Several low-order numerical solutions of stiff systems of ordinary differential equations are computed by repeated integration, using a multistep formula with parameters. By forming suitable linear combinations of such solutions, higher-order solutions are obtained. If the parameters are properly chosen the underlying solutions, and thus the higher-order one, can be made A-stable and strongly damping with respect to the stiff components of the system. A detailed description is given of an algorithmic implementation of the method, which is computationally efficient. Numerical experiments are carried out on some test problems, confirming the validity of the method."
"In a recent series of papers, one of the authors has developed and demonstrated properties of a computational algorithm for solving partial differential equations. This process, known as the hopscotch algorithm, has been studied particularly with reference to the efficient integration of parabolic and elliptic problems. In the present paper attention is directed to the application of the technique to the numerical integration of first-order nonlinear hyperbolic systems. While maintaining the properties of the hopscotch process as applied to parabolic problems, it is shown that one of the novel schemes generated by this approach has an added bonus, namely, maximum stability for a variable choice of damping or pseudoviscous term. This property should be of particular value in the solution of problems with shocks. A class of hopscotch Lax-Wendroff schemes is also studied."
"A direct method is given for the solution of the spherical harmonics approximation to the Boltzmann equation for neutron transport in slab geometry. The roundoff instability of the problem is eliminated by performing linear transformations of the matrices involved, which ensure that the matrix columns are linearly independent. The novelty of the method lies in that only a minimum number of matrix transformations is performed, the precise number being determined dynamically, efficiently, and in a new way by the program itself in the course of the computation."
"A method, based on finite element techniques, is described for obtaining finite differences for Neumann conditions on irregularly shaped boundaries. The resultant difference equations may be used in both time-dependent and -independent problems. As an example, the propagation of an elastic surface wave (Rayleigh wave) around a 90° corner is studied. The results of this simulation compare favorably with laboratory experiments."
"Expansions of functions in series of Chebyshev polynomials are frequently used in numerical analysis. The coefficients occurring in the expansion are definite integrals; the purpose of this paper is to investigate numerical integration formulae for the coefficients of highest degree of precision."
"The problem of determining the optimal values of relaxation parameters for a linear iteration is solved. The optimal iteration scheme is achieved by a second-order linear iteration method."
"In this paper the numerical properties of the Ritz-Trefftz algorithm are discussed in the context of the numerical approximation to the linear parabolic regulator problem using multivariate splines. The algorithm is first derived in the problem context and the resulting linear algebraic system is discussed. Such properties as definiteness and band structure are treated. The algorithm is applied to a number of sample control problems, and it is shown that the method yields efficient and highly accurate continuous approximations to the solutions of the selected sample problems. Computer implementation of the general algorithm is also discussed."
"An algorithm is described for calculating the existing Padé approximants to any sequence A0, A1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ of s × t-matrices. As an application the algorithm gives a new way for finding the minimal polynomial of any square matrix A and the inverse of the characteristic matrix xI − A."
"The mathematical programming problem discussed is the convergence of a certain popular type of gradient procedure for maximizing a function under inequality constraints. An example shows that convergence to a solution need not always occur, and a theorem shows that under certain circumstances the gradient method does converge."
"A new method is given for finding all shortest distances in a directed network. The amount of work (in performing additions, subtractions, and comparisons) is slightly more than half of that required in the best of previous methods."
"Improved methods are discussed for handling sparse matrices in practical linear programming. An analytical comparison is made of four methods for updating the inverse in the iterations following a reinversion. Of these, one technique using the elimination form of inverse is selected for some computational experiments and its advantages in terms of speed and sparseness demonstrated."
"An enumerative scheme is presented for the (0,1) knapsack problem as a specialization of the state enumeration method. Techniques are explored for rendering search procedures more efficient by systematic use of information generated during execution of the algorithm. The inequalities of Benders and Gomory-Johnson are exploited to yield implicit enumeration tests in the special case of the knapsack problem. In a comparative study of eight algorithms and of the utility of certain approximations and inequalities, computational results are given for twelve knapsack problems, each having ten (0,1) variables. The effectiveness of these enumerative algorithms are thus tested in a relatively simple framework."
"There are two procedures for applying the method of conjugate gradients to the problem of minimizing a convex, nonlinear function: the “continued” method, and the “restarted” method in which all the data except the best previous point are discarded, and the procedure is begun anew from that point. It is demonstrated by example that in the absence of the standard initial starting condition on a quadratic function, the continued conjugate gradient method will converge to the solution no better than linearly. Furthermore, it is shown that for a general nonlinear function, the nonrestarted conjugate gradient method converges no worse than linearly."
"It has been conjectured that the Davidenko–Branin method for solving simultaneous nonlinear equations is globally convergent, provided that the surfaces on which each equation vanishes are homeomorphic to hyperplanes. We give an example to show that this conjecture is false. A more complicated example shows that the method may fail to converge to a zero of the gradient of a scalar function, so the associated method for function minimization is not globally convergent."

   "The principal purpose of this paper is to illustrate by means of simple examples a technique for deriving programs and generating functions from set descriptions. The paper discusses certain interesting correspondences among types of trees, which follow from the use of the technique, and it demonstrates close connections between programming techniques and some aspects of combinatorial theory."
"A recursive algorithm is implemented to give high computational speeds in the solution of a cutting-stock problem. Optimal edge-to-edge cutting is shown to be achieved more easily by recursive programming than by conventional methods. The technique features preliminary discretization, which lowers the memory requirements in the computational procedure. A comparison is made between this recursive algorithm and two iterative algorithms previously given by Gilmore-Gomory. The limitations of the algorithms are discussed and some numerical results given."
"The Holland equations for a multiunit system of distillation columns, interconnected so as to contain recycle loops, can be expressed as a matrix generalization of the Holland equations for a single complex column. Proof of the existence and uniqueness of a positive solution for the single-column case has previously been given. In this paper a proof is given for the case of a multiunit system containing one recycle loop."
"This paper reviews the structure of decision tables and methods for converting them into procedural code. It describes new optimization methods, which are applied before, during, and after code generation. Some results from an experimental decision table processor are provided."
"A new method has been developed for solving a system of nonlinear equations g(x) = 0. This method is based on solving the related system of differential equations dg/dt ± g(x) = 0 wherein the sign is changed whenever the corresponding trajectory x(t) encounters a change in sign of the Jacobian determinant or arrives at a solution point of g(x) = 0. This procedure endows the method with a much wider region of convergence than other methods (occasionally, even global convergence) and enables it to find multiple solutions of g(x) = 0 one after the other. The principal limitations of the method relate to the extraneous singularities of the differential equation. The role of these singularities is illustrated by several examples. In addition, the extension of the method to the problem of finding multiple extrema of a function of N variables is explained and some examples are given."
"Discontinuities in glasses deposited on silicon substrates are readily detected by a silicon-preferential etch that uses single component alkali solutions. The etchants can be applied to thermally gown oxide films, pyrolytically-deposited passivating layers or sputtered quartz. The character of the discontinuities in these films is shown and the size can be estimated (although both observations are subject to the limitations of the optical tools used for observation or micrography). When applied in the temperature range below +70°C, the etchant attacks the oxides insignificantly and the concentration, as well as the temperature, is chosen for convenience. Above +70°C the passivating layers, particularly thermal SiO2, are etched at higher rates, and the etching effects must be taken into account if the oxide thickness is less than 1000 Å. The etchants are applicable to intrinsic as well as extrinsic silicon up to a doping level of 1020cm−3."
"The technique of nuclear backscattering has been used to analyze the interface reactions of Nb-Nb2O5-Bi multilayer films. This new analytical technique is explained in detail. It has been concluded that the drastic and erratic changes in the electrical properties of niobium oxide switchable resistor devices that take place at 450°C are associated with the gross migration of oxygen from the oxide to the niobium layer. The accompanying reactions of bismuth with the oxide are relatively moderate, diffusing less than 3 × 1011 atoms/cm2 of bismuth into the oxide layer."

   "This paper describes a method for calculating multiloop inductances formed by complicated interconnection conductors. Knowledge of these inductances leads to useful information concerning the design of such systems. In the approach pursued here, the conductor loops are divided into segments for which so-called partial inductances are calculated. The partial inductances are then appropriately added to yield the desired loop inductance."
"A critical lesson learned in the past decade is that technology skillfully created to increase industrial production and to advance our standard of living is not an unqualified triumph over nature. We have come to realize that decisions to apply sophisticated technology must involve realistic evaluations of probable consequences in the vast interactive system that is our natural environment."
"We have developed a model for computing time-dependent behavior in raindrop size distributions for a variety of initial conditions. The model permits the inclusion of a spatially varying atmospheric profile and takes evaporation and coalescence of raindrops into account on a dynamic basis. We have applied this model to the washout process by rain, whereby small airborne particles are scavenged below a rain cloud. In comparing our results with those of previously published time-independent models, we found that the time-dependent effects greatly altered washout at lower elevations."
"A cooperative agreement between Yale University and the 1970 summer program of the IBM Research Division resulted in a flexible computer program to simulate the growth of the uneven-aged, mixed-species stands of trees on the 10-meter by 10-meter experimental plots of the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study in the White Mountains of northern New Hampshire. Annual increments of tree growth are based on species, tree size, and allocation of available light among the competing trees of the plot. Site quality differences between plots are assigned primarily by the concept of tree-growing degree-days, although soil moisture storage during the growing season and plot rockiness are also considered. Species succession, individual tree suppression and release, and other dynamic properties of forest stands have been successfully reproduced using the program. Additional field measurements are needed to further verify the model and to extend its applicability to nutrient cycling and other aspects of the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study. We believe that the simulator could readily be extended to include most other tree species of northeastern North America and also to match data from other sites through appropriate adjustment of program parameters."
"One result of the growing concern over surface-water pollution has been an increase in the popularity of ground-based waste disposal practices that save the streams but have a high potential for subsurface pollution. One of these, sanitary landfill, appears quite promising in its ability to handle large waste loads with a minimum of contamination; but two others, waste lagoons and deep-well injection of liquid wastes into geologic formations, lead to irreversible subsurface pollution. In all cases, the mechanism of pollution is an interaction between the pollutant source and the existing soil-moisture and groundwater flow systems. A mathematical model of the subsurface flow can be used to predict this interaction and to assess the impact on the environment of a proposed disposal site. The model applied in this paper can predict transient and steady state subsurface flow systems in two or three dimensions and includes consideration of both the saturated and the unsaturated zones. It can be applied at the reconnaissance stage on a regional basis to analyze a large number of alternative sites and at the chosen site to test the efficiency of various design alternatives and to provide guidance in the design of a monitoring system. The model predicts only convective transport and does not consider dispersion or hydrochemical reactions."
"This work applies a one-dimensional model, based on K. Terzaghi's theory of vertical consolidation, to the calculation of land subsidence in the Venetian Lagoon, caused by extraction of water from artificial wells. Certain assumptions are made in order to compensate for the scarcity of data currently available, and these are discussed with regard to both the geophysical characteristics of the subsoil and the decline in piezometric level in the various strata. The interpretation of the results shows a direct correlation between water extraction and surface subsidence."
"Current methods of terrain classification by means of airborne multispectral observations are reviewed with emphasis on the selection of training sets for determination of the categorizer parameters. A method of selecting sample regions for assigning identities to the spectral signatures on the basis of statistically determined similarities, rather than on a priori considerations, is suggested. This method has been tested on data collected on two flights with the University of Michigan scanner over an agricultural region in California. We have found that a simple clustering algorithm, modified to take into account specific features of the crop-census problem, can be used to obtain the desired homogeneous regions with relatively little computation and that very sparse sampling of these regions is sufficient to assign the appropriate category to each cluster. Viewed as a two-stage sampling procedure, clustering improves the second stage classification on 15 crops from 20 to 50 percent over a random selection of the primary sampling units. The accuracy increases to 73 percent when only five classes are considered, with further improvement to 88 percent when a majority decision based on known field boundaries is used."
"This paper describes a prototype Ecology Decision Game which has been developed for experimental use within IBM. The paper is directed to those in ecology desiring to use similar techniques in developing programs that interrelate computing, management science, mathematics, and APL for training and educational purposes. The game is implemented in two modes: an author mode, which permits an author to write his own scenario; and a player mode, which enables a person to play the game. Features of the game exploit interactive capabilities for both modes. The particular scenario written for the game treats decision-making in the environmental area of solid-waste management. Three submodules explore progressively more complicated situations that give rise to management science problems: shortest route, transportation, and maximal flow. By active and passive role-playing, and controlled and uncontrolled learning, the player is given the opportunity to use quantitative tools to refine his subjective judgments."
"An experimental multisource air pollution diffusion model based on the Gaussian plume formulation is described. The model incorporates point and area sources, time and space dependence of source strengths, and time and space dependence of meteorological variables. Numerical simulation of the SO2 concentration distribution for New York City on January 11, 1971, agrees favorably with experimental measurements."
"This report describes a numerical method based on the best gradient-transfer theory currently available for computing pollutant concentration distributions downwind from a stack. The vertical inhomogeneity of the atmosphere and ground roughness are included in the model. Vertical wind and temperature profiles are calculated numerically from given values of ground roughness and wind speed and relative temperature at stack height. An equation governing the plume from the stack is solved by a finite difference method. The numerical results, compared with several experiments, suggest that ground roughness is an important parameter and that disagreement between different sets of experimental data may be due to different values of this parameter. The effect of wind is found to be small under neutral conditions. The effective mean wind decreases to a minimum value a short distance from the stack and then increases downwind."
"The realism of Shir's results may at first appear paradoxical. His numerical model is two-dimensional, so that the simulated stacks are actually line sources, whereas real-atmosphere stacks are (essentially) point sources. The physical dimensions of the source strengths aren't even the same for the two cases. Moreover, even in a unidirectional wind field, atmospheric turbulence acts to diffuse the plume in the three directions, not two. This point is especially important in view of the basic differences between two- and three-dimensional turbulence, which arise from the absence of vortex stretching in the two-dimensional case."
"Radiative transfer in model atmospheres including CO2, water vapor, ozone, and clouds can be explored by computer simulation for the purpose of predicting the mean temperature at the surface of the earth. Where two or more gases have overlapping absorption lines, the overlap emissivity determined from the band-averaged expressions is a possible source of uncertainty. This method has been tested in a 250-cm−1 region around 15 µm where the CO2 absorption overlaps the tail of the water vapor rotation band. Published high resolution spectra of these gases enable the overlap effects to be calculated for small spectral intervals and summed over the band. This calculation was made and compared with the value given by the approximate treatment for the same gas concentrations, pressure, and temperature. Agreement was within 10 percent, indicating that the more detailed spectral calculation is unnecessary."
"Investigation of bucket brigade (BB) and charge-coupled devices (CCD) has resulted in the development of a general model for these devices and their various modes of operation. Similarities and differences between BB and CCD are discussed. The nonlinear partial differential equation of charge motion composed of self-induced drift, thermal diffusion, and electrode fringe-field terms is used to study CCD numerically. The factors that affect charge transfer are investigated by varying the stored charge density, the device length, the transfer-gate-to-storage electrode voltage, and the fringe field. The results include several plots of charge transfer vs time."

   "This issue of the Journal is devoted entirely to mechanical technology, in recognition of an engineering discipline that plays a large and growing role in the development of business machines. We have selected papers that we believe are representative of the variety of work now being done by IBM, and have emphasized methods and results that havpeo tential application beyond the specific problems from which they derive."
"A peel test is a useful method for comparing the behavior of various adherends and adhesives. An exact analysis of the mechanics of the peel test would be of great help in the interpretation of test results in terms of the bulk properties of the materials, and of the failure mechanism of the bond. The existing theories of peeling apply to elastic peel films, very thin elastic or viscoelastic adhesive, and a rigid substrate. In many applications the film is metallic, stressed beyond its elastic range; the elasticity of the substrate is often similar to that of the adhesive; and the adhesive may be quite thick compared to the film, or may be wholly absent as in electroplated components. In this paper, the effects of non-elastic behavior of the film are analyzed. Results from the use of computer programs that incorporate an analytical model of steady state peeling are presented and compared with experimental data."
"The purpose of this study was to develop a theoretical means for predicting the longitudinal motion of computer tape in a high-performance tape drive. In particular, this paper treats the motion that is governed by traveling velocity-stress wave reflections, attenuations, and interactions in the length of tape between the tangency point at the capstan and the tangency point at the stubby column in the drive."
"A common method for moving a machine member from one position to another is the use of a spring. Spring-driven devices are simple, inexpensive, and easy to implement; however, the velocity characteristics of such devices leave much to be desired. The velocity increases from the initial position to the final position resulting in a maximum velocity, and therefore maximum energy in the mechanism, at the final position. The simplest method of stopping the device, a rigid stop, results in high impact forces and undesirable noise. Many methods have been developed for limiting the velocity of spring-driven mechanisms, such as the centrifugal friction brakes used in telephone dials and fans used in music boxes. Other approaches such as dashpots or shock absorbers have been used to decelerate devices. This paper discusses a method for both velocity control and deceleration by the use of a single pneumatic cylinder. In addition, a method of reducing velocity variability due to differences among the work functions of the mechanism is described, and the application of such a device to a paper-cutting mechanism is presented. The concepts and theory presented are general and therefore apply to the entire class of spring-driven mechanisms."
"The quality of the copy to be produced by the IBM Copier was of utmost importance in the machine development. This dictated that the amplitude of the vibrations of the document scanning system during scan be limited to a very low level. The design considerations, analysis, simulation, and instrumentation used to assure adequate performance of the system are described."
"A document reader-sorter is analytically studied to determine the effect of document velocity on the number of documents that can be sorted reliably in a given interval of time, and a formula is derived that relates the effect of various design parameters to the throughput of a document sorting machine. One of these parameters, selector response time (i.e., indexing time), is investigated in detail. Both analytical and graphical design techniques are developed to minimize the response time of the selector. These techniques, which are explained by simple examples, are quite general and can therefore be applied to many other incrementing devices."
"Proper interpretation of the time and frequency characteristics of machine noise provides information useful in identifying and quantifying noise sources in complex mechanisms. The use of commercial acoustic instrumentation led to the development of unique analog instrumentation for noise-time analysis and ultimately to a real-time analog-digital signal analysis capability. The hybrid system described in this paper provides the time and frequency resolution necessary for noise source identification and evaluation."
"Holographic interferometry with a pulsed ruby laser is used to determine printer type-piece deformation caused by impact of the print hammer. A variety of type-piece designs are examined. Effects of impact velocity and hammer-type-piece alignments are studied. Means of obtaining stress information from the holographic data are considered. Cubic spline methods are used to smooth the holographic data and to obtain continuous first and second derivatives. The stresses calculated from the holographic data agree well with those obtained by other means such as finite element analysis. Some limitations of the holographic technique as well as its advantages are discussed. Considerable type-piece twisting is observed; this was not expected or known previously. The most significant result is that a type-piece tends to twist when impacted by the hammer at any point other than the exact center. The twist angle is of the same magnitude as the angle of out-of-plane motion of the type. Hence the type may impact the platen on one corner or side edge. Also, the type bends greatly in the necked down region adjacent to the character and does not pivot by a large amount at its bearing point. Twisting motion is propagated from one end of the type to the other."
"An application of the white light interferometry technique has been developed for measuring the thickness of thin films. The technique is used in the development of sliders which serve as carriers for the magnetic transducers (read/write elements) that operate in close proximity to magnetic disks. With the proper design of a surface contour and the applied load on the slider, a self-acting air bearing is created under the slider due to the boundary layer existing on a rotating disk."
"Current relaxation methods used by most large-scale thermal-computation programs for solving steady-state temperature distributions are subject to numerical instability when radiation is present in the system under study. The instability is usually due to the linearization of the numerical formulation of the governing equations and manifests itself as an oscillatory or divergent solution. A new method of solution is presented, which takes advantage of the diagonal dominance of the coefficient matrices of the linear and nonlinear transfer modes and uses a Gauss-Seidel system relaxation method together with a Newton-Raphson root-evaluation technique. System solution appears similar to that for a diagonally dominant linear system for all magnitudes of radiation. Test cases show the method to be monotonically convergent over the entire range of the radiation parameter considered, while previous methods were found to fail at certain magnitudes of the nonlinear term."
"The production of complex heat transfer surfaces (i.e., those without straight fins) is restricted by available fabrication techniques, materials, geometries, and cost. Based on the superplastic sheet thermoforming process, a new technique for fabricating these complex surfaces by a relatively simple, low cost process has been developed. The resulting surfaces have excellent heat transfer characteristics and can be used in a wide variety of applications. Surface design is discussed, and heat transfer and flow friction test data on various surface patterns are presented. The application of these results to unique design situations is demonstrated and particular examples are discussed."
"Thermal characteristics that are important to structural integrity are analyzed herein for a TTL, plastic-encapsulated package. By assuming that total module heat during operation is engendered at idealized junctions between lead wires and the chip surface, an analysis of its dissipation has been undertaken to determine internal steady-state temperature profiles and heat flux distribution. Based on junction heat sources of equal strength and on certain adiabatic assumptions, the multi-wire package has been modeled as a single-wire “composite” incorporating postulated heat dissipation mechanisms in representative plastic-to-wire and chip-to-lead frame thermal circuits. These circuits are treated, respectively, by axisymmetric and one-dimensional analyses. Instead of a partial differential equation approach in the former treatment, a less complicated method is devised which leads to characterization by a pair of linear ordinary differential equations. Their closed-form solution gives expressions for calculating two-dimensional temperature profiles and heat flux fractions. The resultant analyses are applied to a module containing 14 lead wires and operating at a given power level. The plastic and wire temperature profiles are seen to be nonlinear in the neighborhood of the chip surface and to coalesce axially into a common, essentially linear form in the outlying regions of the module. Constituent heat fluxes are also calculated for each thermal circuit, and some implications of the overall results to thermal stress are qualitatively discussed."
"Because of the complexity and interconnection density of today's integrated circuit chips, experimental measurement of individual transistor or diode junction temperatures under typical powered conditions has become increasingly difficult. In order to provide meaningful thermal data, other approaches have had to be devised. In the work described by this paper, an analytical model has been used to determine the steady state junction temperature rise on an integrated circuit chip. The effect on junction temperature of heat source size, geometry, and number of adjacent heat sources has been studied. Experimental testing on specially prepared chips has verified the analytical results."
"This communication describes two non-contacting techniques for dynamic measurement of high frequency microinch displacements, which have been applied in monitoring the dynamic displacement of the magnetostrictive transducer system used in ultrasonic welding. One technique consists of a light reflecting scheme that uses a fine fiber optic probe. The probes are available in a range of sizes and, in general, can be used to measure displacements of from zero to 0.030 in. at low frequencies and from 5 to 5000 µin. at any frequency below 100 kHz. The second method, an acoustical technique, leads to results similar to those obtained with the reflective system and can be used with a 0.030-inch diameter acoustic probe; this technique has been used in a frequency range well above that usually associated with probe tube measurements."
"It has been shown that certain materials, because of their ability to rotate the polarization vector of plane polarized light, can be applied to very large data-stores. One such material (iron-doped europium oxide) requires an operating temperature below 100 K. To produce an experimental device with superior cost/performance, a rotating disk file configuration was chosen. In developing this machine there were many unique demands placed on bearing technology, vacuum technology and system configuration. These and some material considerations, as well as the novel engineering features, will be described."

   "The successful design and production of high density, high speed monolithic memory circuits that can operate efficiently over wide current ranges can be directly attributed to the development of a new silicon process technology based on the (100) crystal orientation. To provide optimum capability to fabricate these circuits with high yields, process modifications to accommodate larger starting substrates (wafers) have also been adopted. Detailed electrical characterization of the resulting devices has confirmed improved circuit operation, demonstrating that improved gain at low current and good junction quality are consequences of the process modifications."
"The IBM 2305 Fixed Head Storage and IBM 3330 Disk Storage provide significant performance improvements over previously available disk facilities. Many of the improvements were made possible by the design of the control units, which are complex systems that integrate analog and digital interfaces. Definition of control unit requirements and characteristics permitted a large degree of commonality to be achieved between the two control units. The available design alternatives and implementations are discussed."
"An analysis of readout signal and noise generation is presented for a magneto-optical data storage system which uses a single laser beam for both Curie-point thermal writing and Faraday readout of magneto-optical films. The analysis is applied to a cryogenic beam addressable file model which utilizes GaAs injection lasers and doped EuO film."
"Theoretical expressions for the distribution of deposits sputtered from disk-shaped and rectangular electrodes are derived for cases of 1) uniform emission obeying the cosine emission law, 2) distorted “under cosine” and “over cosine” emission, 3) additional emission confined to the peripheries of the electrodes and obeying the cosine emission law, and 4) distorted “inward” emission from the peripheries."
"A symmetrical, cross-coupled, two-thyristor storage cell with 1 µW stand-by power dissipation and 60 nsec switching time is described. When integrated in silicon planar technology each thyristor consists of a vertical npn transistor and a lateral pnp transistor."
"The APL language allows subscripted expressions such as A[I;J;K], where A is an array and I, J and K may be scalars, vectors or arrays of any size and shape. We describe an efficient method of evaluating these expressions. The method is quite general and yet it does recognize all the special cases in which multiple subscripts can be reduced to a simpler form. We show how the same mechanism can be used to evaluate other selection operations, such as transpose, and how selection operations may be combined."
"The assumption about virtual memory systems that as overhead (time for access and software page management) decreases page size should be reduced is not always a good one. Recent experiments indicate that larger page sizes can provide better performance for programs that make highly localized use of memory space."
"In conventional sputter etching, heterogeneous surfaces are eroded at generally unpredictable rates. The reasons for this are discussed and a solution to the problem is given: Based on control of redeposition, the technique involves the use of a device called a “catcher,” which is placed near the target of the sputtering chamber to trap re-emitted particles. Experiments are described which confirm the effectiveness of the approach."
"An etch-epitaxial refill technique is described for the fabrication of integrated high-speed Ge transistor structures having a pedestal configuration. The device areas surrounding 0.1 ohm-cm mesa structures were refilled with Ge having a resistivity range of 1 to 10 ohm-cm, providing low parasitic capacitance in the passive area of the base-collector junction. Processes and techniques were developed for minimizing the ridge that tends to form at the edge of the deposited SiO2 mask. Electrical properties and junction characteristics of the epitaxial regions are discussed and some device results presented."

 "As Chairman and Past President of the G-SMC, I have observed that SMC members are indeed concerned about societal problems-more so than the general public or even the IEEE as a whole. An analysis of papers appearing in this TRANSACTIONS and those presented at our conferences shows that while 2/3 relate to our prime technical interests, 1/3 relate to interdisciplinary problems, most of which concern transportation, education, health care, urban, public safety, and environmental quality problems. On this point I will share with you the concerns of Aurelio Peccei of the Club of Rome, a small transnational organization concerned with the effect of technology on man. I have abstracted (with permission) a number of key points appearing in his dramatic article, \"How to Survive on Planet Earth,\" which appeared in the February 1971 issue of Successo. His concerns are similar to those of many of our members."

"The biological and social sciences offer many examples of complex systems which were not consciously designed or engineered but which have evolved over long periods from more primitive forms. Built-in mechanisms for control or guidance of such systems may be quite elaborate but somewhat imperfect and indirect. Two primary propositions are discussed. The first is that the evolution of the complex markets basic in western economies has realized an institutional structure through which decentralized guidance of the economy can be implemented. The second is that with such market structures it may be possible to design economic policies which realize sufficient control of the economic system without direct intervention in the optimizing decisions of individual elements in the system. The paper is primarily tutorial and surveys the relevant technical literature on models of economic growth. However, some new results and a new interpretation of known results are presented."
"When there is a high-volume usage of a product which requires procurement through multisourcing, the question must be asked: ``How would the business respond to a loss (complete or temporary) of one or more of the sources providing the product?'' The answer to this question is largely dependent upon factors such as the following: a) the ability of other present sources to provide additional units beyond present deliveries, in conjunction with their current or potential tooling, test, and manpower capabilities; b) the response time of other sources to added demands; c) the extent and nature of the disaster to a particular source and its relative ability to recover; d) the amount of protection provided by present inventory levels. Simulation of a disaster at a key source or sources can give invaluable insight into these factors and serve as an aid to management in the development of sourcing strategy and the maintenance of protection inventory levels. A model has been developed which determines the impact of a disaster at any of the sources producing one or more key products. The model simulates the interaction of deliveries and requirements on inventory levels as deliveries are impacted by disaster. This model enables an accurate assessment of sourcing strategy and provides management with the ability to perform quick turn around ``what if'' studies to aid in future decisions."
"Some problems may be divided into subsystems containing elements of the problem which are strongly related to each other within a subsystem and weakly related to the elements in other subsystems. In the methodology relative weights are assigned to the relationships between the elements. These weights are simulated by resistors connected to nodes which represent the elements. Electrical network theory is used to derive grouping indices which include the direct and indirect effects of multiple relationships. A rationale for grouping the elements is developed into an algorithm. Results of empirical testing of the methodology are applied to a color television. The results of this are compared with decompositions found by factor analysis and HIDECS programs, showing that more useful results can be obtained."
"A fuzzy mapping from X to Y is a fuzzy set on X × Y. The concept is extended to fuzzy mappings of fuzzy sets on X to Y, fuzzy function and its inverse, fuzzy parametric functions, fuzzy observation, and control. Set theoretical relations are obtained for fuzzy mappings, fuzzy functions, and fuzzy parametric functions. It is shown that under certain conditions a precise control goal can be attained with fuzzy observation and control as long as the observations become sufficiently precise when the goal is approached."
"In a multidegree of freedom manipulator there can exist the problem of how to coordinate all the actuators to produce movement in a space of lower dimension. In this paper statistical decision procedures are used to select an elbow position of an externally powered arm aid to deal with this problem. The decision makers are derived from a set of exoskeletal goniometer movement recordings of typical daily tasks. Both pattern recognition and regression techniques are employed. Pattern recognition is used to decide which class of tasks the human is currently performing based on the desired end-point position and the position of the three hand axes: wrist supination, wrist flexion, and prehension. A regression function with end-point position arguments is then used to estimate a parameter called the ``elbow angle.'' The combination of the elbow angle and the desired end-point position is transformed geometrically to obtain the correct actuator positions of the assistive device. Both decision schemes are implemented in a real-time algorithm for the computer control of a modified Rancho electric arm."
"The purpose of this presentation is to develop and evaluate an algorithm for determining a finite memory detector applicable to statistical signal detection theory. In the Bayesian signal detection theory, infinite soft or changeable memory is tacitly assumed. Since an infinite memory is physically unrealizable, this study postulates a finite memory scheme which is applicable to a large class of signal detection problems. A general sequentially operating finite memory detector design is obtained and then evaluated for the signal known exactly and the signal known except amplitude problems. Detection performance as a function of memory size is presented for finite observation records using the receiver operating characteristic and plots of probability of decision error versus time. These results show the tradeoff between memory size and processing time to achieve a given detection performance. An important result is that for finite sample records a small finite memory detector with a memory size on the order of 7 states, i.e., a 3-bit computer word, yields detection performance very near that of the optimum infinite memory detector."
"A nonsupervised learning algorithm for multicategory pattern classification is presented, and its steady-state behavior is investigated by means of analysis and simulation. The algorithm assigns each pattern in an input sequence x(t) to one of the M possible categories by comparing the M values wi(t)' x(t), i = 1,2,...,M, where wi(t)are variable weight vectors adjusted according to a differential-equation type of rule. The algorithm minimizes a certain form of criterion function. Analytical techniques are developed for finding the steady-state solutions of the differential equation and for determining the stability of each solution found. By applying the techniques, the steady-state behavior of the algorithm to three types of patterns is analyzed in detail. It is shown that although the algorithm does not necessarily yield a unique solution every solution yielded is associated with a reasonable Classification such that one cluster or some adjacent clusters in the pattern distribution correspond to one category. Even if the total number of clusters in the distribution is smaller than M, no cluster is divided between two categories. Converging to the origin, unnecessary weight vectors vanish in the steady state. These results are verified by some digital computer simulations."
"An algorithm is discussed which decomposes a noisy composite signal of identical but unknown multiple wavelets overlapping in time. The decomposition determines the number of wavelets present, their epochs, amplitudes, and an estimate of the basic wavelet shape. The algorithm is an adaptive decomposition filter which is a combination tion of three separate filters. One is an adaptive cross-correlation filter which resolves the composite signal from noise by an iteration procedure; this is followed by a wavelet extraction filter which ferrets out the basic wavelet form, and last there appears an inverse filter which achieves decomposition of the composite signal in the time domain. The decomposition algorithm can be applied to echoes and overlapping wavelets which might arise in radar, sonar, seismology, or electro-physiology. The proposed theory has been thoroughly simulated and selected experimental results are presented to demonstrate the technique. These include decomposition of brain waves evoked by visual stimulation."
"In the recognition of complex patterns it is becoming more apparent that segmentation (object isolation) and pattern classification cannot be performed by independent procedures. A pilot study is described which employs feedback to control the interaction of segmentation and segment classification in a system under development for automatic recognition of continuous speech. The potential advantages of employing such interaction in this work are discussed, and data are presented which indicate that this approach is promising."
"It is well known that the propagation velocities of the fibers in peripheral nerve bundles are distributed over a considerable range. The fastest fibers subserving a particular end organ may have conduction velocities four or five times greater than the slowest fibers subserving that end organ. Since the fibers for a particular end organ are of nearly equal length, this velocity dispersion causes a latency dispersion or desynchronization of neural signals traveling along the nerve bundle. The most outstanding effect of dispersion is a low-pass filter effect. Nulls and peaks in the transfer function may also occur as a result Of sharp truncation of a distribution or multimoded distributions of conduction velocities."
"Linear discrete-time systems containing state and control variables which are randomly delayed are studied. The original system with randomly delayed variables is transformed to another system in which independent random variables appear as plant parameters. For the reformulated system the optimal control which minimizes a quadratic cost is determined. It is also the optimal control for the original problem. The approach is illustrated by an example which describes a production-inventory system."
 "The case is considered in which the shape of a moving object is observed from a fixed point of reference along the line of motion. Three distinct recognition algorithms are introduced: for recognizing patterns per se, for recognizing patterns in symbolic context and for recognizing patterns in the context of their motion. The second of these algorithms requires two observations of the moving object; that is, it must be observed from two distinct points along the line of motion. There are implications that the introduction of context into pattern recognition may depend upon a degradation of the recognition mechanism. If a moving object is to be recognized independent of the speed with which it moves past a point of reference, then the shape of the object must be generalized to a number of segments over which the derivatives of the variables defining its shape are continuously contained in one of the four classes: {the negative reals}, {zero}, {the positive reals}, and {infinity}."
"A conceptual framework for an analytic theory of form or shape is presented. It is demonstrated that by using various statistics on the chords of a pattern objective measures of pattern features can be obtained. The autocorrelation function of the patterns is one such statistic, and it is shown how the autocorrelation function can be exploited to enhance and/or extract pattern features. One of the interesting facets of the theory is that it can be implemented using a parallel processing type of computer."
"Some aspects of a special multimodality and adaptivity in a two-person game, renju (a Japanese alignment game on a board) are presented. It is argued that such a renju multimodality will surely be a new basis of ideas and understanding of adaptive processes in artificial inttelligence requiring multimodal optimum search. The necessary concepts are developed, such as distance between any two points, four directions, string, jumstring, costring, dead (jum)string, and criterion function of a placed stone (piece or chip) on a renju board. The essential aspects of renju multimodality and adaptivity studied here are as follows: possible values of the criterion function, realized number of the highest peak (lowest valley) formed by the criterion function within a game, height of maximum peak versus the issue of the game, possible number of the highest peak (lowest valley), illustration of the criterion function, developing processes of peak and valley, adaptive mobility of the optimum point, and practical appearance of the multimodality of renju problems."
"The constraint of time symmetry applied to linear state equations is used to investigate periodic solutions. Specifically, it is shown that the state of a T-periodic system is T periodic if and only if its odd component is T periodic."
 "Contains an entry for each author and coauthor included in this issue of the publication."
"Methods used to measure the power factor in low-voltage test circuits are covered. Since the power factor measurement for high-capacity test circuits is particularly difficult, and different methods may yield different results, the methods that are least likely to yield errors are recommended for particular circuit conditions. The ratio method is recommended for fast clearing devices that may have total interruption times of 0.5 cycle or less. The DC decrement method is recommended for circuits with a 30% power factor or less when the device to be tested interrupts at a point in time more than 0.5 cycle from the initiation of the current. The phase relationship method, using current and voltage waves, is recommended for circuits having power factors over 30%."
"Overflow detection and overflow recovery imposed no particular requirements on the structure of (X, X1 <; X1, fx). In particular, if f is associative and commutative, overflow recovery is obtainable even if fx is neither associative or commutative."
"Completeness and uniqueness properties for the representation of the base β digital numbers by finite length radix polynomials with various digit sets are studied. The digit sets guaranteeing completeness and uniqueness are characterized. A digital conversion algorithm is introduced for determining a base β radix polynomial with digits from a specified set D having a particular value whenever such a radix polynomial exists. The notion of precision of a radix polynomial is formalized, and the determination of the precision from the given base β, digit set D, and real value a of the radix polynomial is investigated."
"Economics forced abandonment of the Roman Numeral numbering system. Economies will force adoption of a binary derived numbering system. Economies will also force adoption of some type of \"Assembler Digit\". One such system has been proposed and partially implemented. It is suggested that alternate systems be proposed and evaluated, We ought not continue to place crutches under our obsolete Arabic-decimal systems."
"A new class of (separate) multiresidue codes has been proposed, which is capable of double error correction. The codes are derived from a class of AN codes where A is of the form πi=13(2ki-1). Previously all discussions on separate code implementation had restricted themselves to single error correcting codes only. We have shown that these multiple-error correcting separate codes can be relatively easily implemented as the check bases are of the form 2k-1. A comparison with the multiresidue codes derived from Barrows-Mandelbaum codes has shown that these codes have in general a higher information rate and an easier implementation."
"In this paper, two error-correcting algorithms for redundant residue number systems are presented, one for single residue-error correction and the other for burst residue-error correction. Neither algorithm requires table look-up and hence their implementations need a memory space which is much smaller than that required by existing methods. Furthermore, the conditions which the moduli of the redundant residue number systems must satisfy in these two algorithms are less restrictive than that of existing methods. Comparison of the approach on which these two algorithms are based and that of existing methods is given."
"This paper describes a novel implementation scheme for the operations of addition and subtraction in the residue number systems. The method is based on the property that the set of residues modulo m form a finite group under addition (mod m). Therefore, any row in the modulo m addition table is simply a permutation of the elements of any other row. The effect of this on the implementation scheme is as follows: The set of residues modulo m (o to m-1) are held in a register. For operands X and Y, X is used to permute the contents of the register and Y is used to select the appropriate part of the register to be gated into the sum register."
"The precision required for residue operations is primarily associated with resistive components and operational amplifiers. However, technology has advanced to the point that analog components can be built to an accuracy of less than one tenth of one percent (at least with discrete components). Companies are attempting to build DAC'S with fifteen (15) bit accuracy which will settle to the least significant bit in one hundred (100) nanoseconds. None are commercially available but seven or eight bit DAC's with settling times on the order of one hundred (100) nanoseconds are not uncommon. Sixteen (16) bit ADC's have been announced recently as a result of new analog components. It is not uncommon to find operational amplifiers on the market with gain bandwidth products in excess of one hundred fifty (150) megahertz and linearities on the order of one tenth of one percent. One can also find analog voltage comparators (such as the Motorola MC1650) which has a hysteresis of ten millivolts and a switching speed of less than two nanoseconds. Shotkey diodes have been introduced which allow transistors to switch in less than one and one-half nanoseconds, and manufacturers have learned to build both active and passive components to a tolerance of less than one-tenth of one percent."
"It has been shown how arithmetic codes can be embedded in the structure of a module and how generator and check matrices may be defined. The motivation is to parallel the analogy with communication codes with the purpose of showing majority decoding. The technical difficulties in the derivations are pointed out while some partial results are given."
"A processor called Boolean Analyzer has been presented at IFIP Congress 1968 to introduce parallel processing of Boolean expressions [1]. The present paper shows how to increase its speed many times by making its processing more parallel. The applications of the Boolean Analyzer are limited to few but important problems. A typical problem of that kind: listing of all implicants of a function of 7 variables defined by not more than 100 term implicants (of the complement of that function) takes about 40 microsecond only (supposing a delay line storage working at the clock impulserate of 2.106 per sec)."
"The floating point processor expands the power of a minicomputer to perform floating point and scientific functions. In increases the computer's accuracy to 12 decimal digits and increases system throughput for scientific problems by 3 to 5 times. Its applications include minicomputer time-sharing systems, real-time systems and dedicated systems where high-speed and accuracy are required and where the cost of the processor is justified."
"With a view to the computational speed, it is obviously advantageous to perform the frequently used arithmetic operations in the hardware rather than in software, especially in scientifically oriented real-time applications. Here we present two optimal square-rooting algorithms for hardware implementation which utilize high-speed-multiplication of sophisticated scientific computers and no division. One of them is the well-known one, titled here as Algorithm N, which was derived on the mathematical basis of NEWTON iteration scheme;, while the other is a new algorithm, titled as Algorithm G, derived on the basis of Normalization Technique. Algorithm G is compared with Algorithm N in various aspects since Algorithm N has been believed so far to be the most efficient among this class of algorithms. Both possess the property of quadratic convergence, an important property as far as speed is concerned. However, Algorithm G turns out to be faster with no more hardware than Algorithm N, since it requires less time for each iteration, analogous to the higher speed of Goldschmidt' s division algorithm over original NEWTON iteration scheme for division. It is shown that the higher speed of Algorithm G purposed purely for hardware implementation is primarily due to the inherent parallelism which makes full use of characteristics of hardware implementation. Furthermore, in case where Goldschmidt\" s division algorithm is implemented as in IBM 91/360, Algorithm G has more advantages because of possibility to share most of the required hardware with division unit including one for initial approximation. Therefore, it is believed that at present Algorithm G has the most promising advantages for hardware implementation."
"Two addition and three multiplication algorithms were studied to see the effect of pipelining on system efficiency. A definition of efficiency was derived to compare the relative merits of various algorithms and implementations for addition and multiplication. This definition is basically defined as bandwidth/cost. Previous comparisons of adders and multipliers have generally been based on latency. In a pipeline environment, latency (or its Inverse bandwidth) is not as important. Any bandwidth is possible up to the physical limitations on gate delay variations and pulse skew. The formal definition for efficiency is: Efficiency = N / D · G where N is the number of bits in the operands, D is the delay (uniform) of each pipeline stage in units of gate delays and G is the total number of gates, including any used for latching. In cases where gate variations and pulse skewing are well defined pipelining using the Earle latch results in increased efficiency. The most efficient adder is a maximally pipelined conditional-sum adder (3 stages with a delay of 4 gates per stage). Its efficiency is 6.30×10-3. The most efficient multiplier is a maximally pipelined tree multiplier (8 stages with a delay of 4 gates per stage). It efficiency is 3.48×10-4."
"A method for developing combinatoric structures for performing divisions by fixed integers has been demonstrated. In the examples shown the divisions were performed through the use of full adders only, thus illustrating that this technique can be implemented using standard off-the-shelf MSI components."
"The logical design of an adder-subtracter for negative binary numbers is described. The twin-carry generates during the addition, is converted into a single hybrid-carry-borrow, this helps to design a circuit which can function as an adder or a subtracter with a simple switching control."
"The logical design of a polarizer for negative binary numbers is described and compared with the two's complementer used for positive binary numbers."
"The principal purpose of this paper is to illustrate how some well known algorithms have been programmed on a specific vector computer, the CDC STAR-100. The main thesis is that the extensive repertoire of programs devised for conventional machines can be transferred effectively to a vector computer, though the detailed implementation will generally not follow that of a conventional machine. This means, that efficient use of STAR, for example, will not have to wait on the development of new algorithms, but can be realized with those already at hand. Indeed, most lead to much shorter programs on STAR than on conventional computers."
"The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that representations of numbers other than positional notation may lead to practical hardware realizations for the digital calculation of classes of algorithms. It is the authors' opinion that practicality of the use of continued products has been demonstrated. This paper describes current research in the use of continued fractions. Although practicality has not been demonstrated, theoretical results are promising, and the results thus far are presented as a case study of the difficulties which arise when use of a new representation is attempted."
"This paper describes an approach for obtaining a class of similar algorithms for evaluation of some elementary functions. The main objective is to show feasibility of higher radix implementations, in particular radix 16, as they offer better performance than radix 2. The emphasis is not on optimality of a single algorithm but rather on the optimality of the whole class of algorithms. An attempt to implement a much wider class of functions than is done in conventional arithmetic units, would be encouraged by the present level of technology and by the existence of suitable algorithms. Besides the definitions of the algorithms, which are based on continued products (sums), some details related to implementation are discussed."
"The purpose of this paper is to develop a method for evaluation of certain elementary functions on a digital computer by the use of continued fractions. The time required for this evaluation is drastically reduced by using “short” operations like shift and add, instead of multiplications. Consistency is the most important factor that allows the expansion of a function into a continued fraction. Several cases are discussed and in particular the solution of the quadratic equation is discussed in more detail to demonstrate the convergence of the method."
"New applications and new technologies will make high speed decimal arithmetic an attractive alternative to binary arithmetic. This new environment will be characterized by fewer computations for each item of data. Emphasis on binary arithmetic has resulted in techniques permitting great improvements in performance. Similar improvements are needed for decimal. Various forms of LSI arrays will permit new approaches to implementing arithmetic units. ROM arrays used as complex logic blocks permit practical designs of simultaneous multipliers and batch adders, with essentially the same cost and performance for BCD operands as for binary operands of the same word size."
"The document was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings."
"The work to date has provided analytic tools to help answer design questions about table look-up type quotient selectors, and also a means for computer-aided design of any particular version deemed feasible. Reference 4 describes the application of a quotient selector in the arithmetic units of ILLIAC III."
"A single format for the representation of numbers in a computer is proposed to accommodate both exact and inexact quantities. A consistent set of rules is described for addition, multiplication and division of such quantities, both within their separate types, as well as in combination. Error correlation aside, the propagation of inherent errors is monitored in operations with at least one imprecise input. As a simple application, extension of the Forsythe algorithm for finding the roots of a quadratic equation is discussed."
"The appearance of hexadecimal floating point arithmetic systems has prompted a continuing discourse on the relative numerical merits of various choices of base. Until lately this discourse has centered around the static properties of the floating point representation of numbers, and has primarily concerned only binary and hexadecimal representations. Recent events may change this discourse considerably. A third numerically attractive alternative for the choice of base has been proposed, and a comparison of the dynamic numerical properties of floating point arithmetic systems has been completed. This paper surveys these recent events and summarizes our current knowledge of the numerical characteristics of floating point arithmetic systems."
"For scientific computations on a digital computer the set of real numbers is usually approximated by a finite set F of “floating-point numbers”. We compare the numerical accuracy possible with different choices of F having approximately the same range and requiring the same wordlength. In particular, we compare different choices of base (or radix) with the usual floating-point systems. The emphasis is on the choice of F, not on the details of the number representation or the arithmetic, but both rounded and truncated arithmetic are considered. Theoretical results are given, and some simulations of typical floating-point computations (forming sums, solving systems of linear equations, finding eigenvalues) are described. If the leading fraction bit of a normalized base-2 number is not stored explicitly (saving a bit), and the criterion is to minimize the mean square roundoff error, then base 2 is best. If unnormalized numbers are allowed, so the first bit must be stored explicitly, then base 4 (or sometimes base 8) is the best of the usual systems."
"The accumulated round-off error incurred in long arithmetic computations involving a randomized mixture of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations applied to an initial randomly generated data base is studied via simulation. Truncated and rounded floating-point arithmetic and truncated and rounded logarithmic arithmetic are simultaneously utilized for each of the computation sequences and the resulting round-off error accumulations for these four systems are compared. Fundamental results related to the nature of the correlated errors incurred under various arithmetic operator mixes are discussed."
"In this paper we discuss directed roundings and indicate how hardware might be designed to produce proper upward-directed, downward-directed, and certain commonly used symmetric roundings. Algorithms for the four binary arithmetic operations and for rounding are presented, together with proofs of their correctness; appropriate formulas for a priori error analysis of these algorithms are presented. Some of the basic applications of directed roundings are surveyed."
"A mode of implementation of the basic floating-point operations of multiplication and addition (subtraction) is discussed which permits the execution of multiple precision floating-point arithmetic with the aid of a single algorithm for multiple precision addition. Speed cannot compete with explicit implementations in hardware but the time consuming overhead of most software implementations is avoided to advantage."
"A set of standards for the design of the arithmetic unit of all general purpose digital computers has been proposed. This paper discusses that proposal and suggests that such standards are not now in the best interest of either the computer industry or the computer user."

"THE THREE technical papers in this issue all deal with the perennial problem of evaluation in RD&E. Regular readers of this TRANSACTIONS will have found this to be a major theme in the published papers. One discouraging aspect of research and experimentation in this field of evaluation, such as that reported by Glass, Goodwin, and Moskowitz, is that it is not very cumulative. That is, “R&D” on the management of R&D or “Research on Research” is still in a state where individual studies are, in a sense, dropped in the pot to cook for a few years and do not necessarily form a monotonically increasing body of knowledge that managers can readily draw on for policy making, and practice."
"For many years, R&D managers have been trying to devise better yardsticks for measuring the effectiveness and utility of organisations engaged in research and development. This paper summarizes a number of techniques used by the Department of Defense in evaluating the effectiveness of its in-house laboratory systems. The purpose is not to suggest that solutions to the problem of organizational appraisal are in hand, but rather to stimulate interest and discussion in this area of increasing importance."
"The current trend in aerospace business is to provide cost-effective programs and designs that are optimized to provide the most for the dollar but not overdesigned beyond the necessary requirements. Too many dollars can be spent on achieving results far above those required to meet the function for which the design is intended. A systematic, quantitative method is required for deciding how much should be spent in a design effort to obtain better performance and reliability. This paper is an explanation of one method of combining these factors and an example of how it was applied to a project in evaluating alternate potential designs and subsystems."
"This paper describes the results of some experiments, based on a research and development (R&D) game that examined R&D managers' proclivities for various options that hedge against uncertainty and the overall quality of their choices with respect to the Bayesian decision-theoretic model. Thirty R&D managers participated in the experiments, which were conducted at an industrial R&D facility. R&D managers exhibited a higher proclivity for parallel approaches in information acquisition but a lower propensity for parallel approaches in terminal actions, with respect to the Bayesian norm."
"The development of an industry around the laser has failed to match early expectations. This is discussed in terms of the more general high-technology phenomenon of preoccupation with the physical product and lack of market awareness."
"The Proceedings of the 3rd Symposium on Long-Range Forecasting and Planning contain the papers that were presented and the discussion of those papers. The discussion was recorded during the Symposium and has been edited to clarify the speakers' meaning. However, during the editing process a conscious effort was made to retain the flavor of free discussion that marked the Symposium. We feel that the interchange of information and opinion during the discussion adds significantly to the formal presentations and we hope that both the papers and the discussion will prove to be of benefit to all those concerned with methods of long-range forecasting and planning. The reader should remember that the opinions presented by the speakers, particularly during the discussion, are their own and do not necessarily represent the official position of their organizations."

"THE PAPER by Holland deals with a subject of current high interest in our Program of Research on the Management of Research and Development at Northwestern University. This is the special role played by certain members of research, development, and engineering (RD&E) groups in finding, acquiring, and transmitting technical information. There is a growing literature on this subject in several research fields — information systems, interorganizational relations, and small-group communication, among others. Some of the theoretical (and also quite practical) issues being addressed are: the identification of these people, their special attributes (interests, backgrounds, and abilities), their motivation for performing the “filtering” and “funneling” that they do, the way they are perceived and rewarded by colleagues and the managements of their organizations, their information search strategies and styles, their career patterns (are they promotable and promoted?), and their effects on group and organization productivity."
"In order to study focal individuals within informal communications networks, a special variable was constructed: information potential (IP) was defined as the information-source value placed on an individual by his colleagues. Four hypotheses involving IP were tested in three R&D organizations using questionnaires and pencil-and-paper tests. Results indicated that the individual with high IP used more and different sources of technical information, was seen to be a credible information source and to have a strong ability to associate seemingly unrelated ideas, and was as approachable as the other members of his organization. Four tentative conclusions may be drawn from this study concerning the person with high IP. He is 1) an identifiable individual in several different kinds of organizations; 2) a distinctive information transceiver (transmitter and receiver); 3) both a producer and a catalyst in his own organization; and 4) an extender and an amplifier of information search. To affect the efficiency of informal information flow, the research manager's best hope for positively influencing informal networks lies in the identification and motivation of the special communicators in his organization."
"The overall objective of this study is to analyze the results of data obtained from 94 questionnaires administered to 100 scientists and engineers employed in the Missile Systems Laboratory of the U.S. Army Missile Command in order to empirically investigate and identify the most important features of an engineer's or scientist's work environment as they relate to job satisfaction and productivity, and to recommend necessary steps for improvement of working climate in the laboratory. More specifically, the data are analyzed 1) to determine the factors involved in job satisfaction; 2) to relate productivity to job satisfaction, salary, and age of respondents; and 3) to determine, using a chi-square test of independence of classification, if there is any relationship between productivity and job satisfaction. The general conclusions arrived at, based on the sample information, are that 1) job satisfaction is a multidimensional factor; 2) there is general agreement between the findings of this study and similar studies — the points of similarities and dissimilarities are discussed; and 3) there is statistically, significant relationship between productivity and satisfaction."
"This paper describes a methodology for analyzing the organization of engineering development projects. Specially, the methodology focuses on the different roles which engineers play in such projects. A small study based on this methodology showed little specialization by such types of work as project definition, analysis, and experimentation. This result suggests that engineers are multiskilled in the activities of engineering development. This suggestion is consistent with recent theory on organizations as sociotechnical systems."
"Twelve industrial salary surveys covering various positions in the quality-assurance field were studied and compared with salary rates for federal employees in the quality-assurance field. The scope of the study, in terms of industry and geography, was limited in some positions to the aerospace industry in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The positions studied span a wide range of duties and responsibilities. Individually, the positions selected were judged to be representative of occupational groups which are numerically important in industry as well as in federal service. For most positions, salary levels in federal civil service were slightly higher than in private industry. Federal employee salary levels in the nondegree technician jobs were lower than in industry; however, in some technical supervisory and top administrative positions, the federal employee salary levels were considerably lower."
"Critical path method of project planning, scheduling, and control has gained considerable importance because of its theoretical novelty ad practical value. Essentially, this technique is based on the theory of flow through network. Although the structure of a project network is analogous to the electrical net, the branch characteristics fail to show the analogy. Battersby has solved this problem by introducing two kinds of floats, namely, duration and resource floats, in the network. In this paper, a complete electrical analogy is established following a somewhat different approach. With this approach, current is injected or released at the appropriate nodes. The resulting θ, paramount, and dominant matrices present elegance. Further, based on the analogy, a procedure for representing the complete spectrum of costs and schedules is indicated. Also, a useful approach for sensitivity evaluation is presented."
"The results of a retraining program for electronic defense, and aerospace engineers are indicated. The objective of the program was to help these engineers apply their expertise in basic engineering to the construction industry by exposing them to the practical aspects of power, lighting and control. A total of 22 engineers took the program and, at present, 7 are working in the construction field."

"THREE of the four technical papers in this issue involve quantitative methods for decision making in Research, Development, and Engineering (RD&E). These techniques are not easy to use in day-to-day decision making and they do not, at the present state of the art, guarantee feasible as well as mathematically “optimal” or “good” decisions. Why bother developing and publishing them, then, especially in a journal intended to help engineering managers do their jobs better?"
"Two studies of R&D resource requirements are discussed. The first includes a procedure for measuring state-of-the-art advance and incorporating the measure in an estimating relationship for development cost and time. The second study includes a procedure for evaluating management strategies in terms of time, cost, and risk."
"R&D project planning comes down to assessment of risk. Those agencies which issue major R&D contracts, including the government, are asking searching questions about the subsequent management of such risks. The manager is constrained in his search for solutions by time and money, and the approaches available to him are often interdependent. The subjective probabilities needed for risk analysis are illustrated in a brief development of the probability theory requisite for summarizing their import."
"This study compares two R&D work groups with different developmental histories in `identical' positions in a large defense contracting firm. The author attempts to show how their histories affected the ways in which the groups were integrated into the company. The study is exploratory and is intended to emphasize the entrepreneurial and micropolitical aspects of R&D organization. It asks, what did the groups do to survive and prosper within the company context?"
"A technique which uses a combination of quantitative tools to solve a complex and unstructured problem is demonstrated. The technique involves analyzing empirical data through the use of multiple regression analysis in conjunction with the linear programming simplex method."

"BY THE KIND of strange queuing coincidence that makes editors wonder, all five of the papers in this issue deal with either computers, systems analysis, or mathematical treatments of management decision and control problems. The coincidence is that most of our issues contain a mixture of papers across different aspects of the management of Research. Development, and Engineering (RD&E) and a mixture of approaches — verbal, quantitative; scientific, intuitive; descriptive, prescriptive. What is not strange is the trend toward more and more attempts by managers and their staffs (two of the five papers are from nonacademic organizations) to attack problems of RD&E management through the formal methods of operations research, systems analysis, and statistical analysis."
"Engineering companies are frequently requested to submit a fixed-price bid or a ceiling on cost-plus bids. These bids may be subjected to competition or negotiations. In order to determine the bid price, engineering management must first estimate the actual costs to be incurred on the project. The method presented utilizes three estimates for each cost entity considered: a low value, a most likely value, and a high value. From these, estimates of the expected cost and standard deviation of each cost entity as well as the entire project are determined. Once the total cost distribution has been determined, statistically sound probabilistic statements may be made about the estimate, ranges of costs which may be incurred, expected profit at a given bid price, probability of losing money, etc. A specific example is presented and interpreted in detail. The paper concludes with a discussion of several theoretical and practical considerations."
"Using data from a large primary steel products company, two industrial dynamics simulation models were constructed to study the effects of process control computer-generated information on management control systems. The first model represented the existing system, the other a proposed process control/business control interfaced system. The research provides an initial step in the solution of the problem of integrating process control and management control systems by investigating the relationship between process information and control decisions at the operating level of management. The proposed system model indicated much less fluctuation in inventory levels following changes in demand, lower backlog ratios, higher inventory ratios, lower delivery delay ratios, and higher levels of customer satisfaction. The proposed system was also fairly insensitive to changes in the time between transmissions from the process control system to the management control systems once the interface was effected."
"Most of the equipment performance and data problems experienced on recent aerospace programs suggest inadequate consideration of performance and data requirements and the absence of a discipline to assure complete definition of system hardware and software elements. A system requirements analysis (SRA) technique is described which is a discipline for complete system definition and also provides a medium for effective program management. To demonstrate by example how this SRA technique provides thorough consideration of all program objectives, data management is considered as a unique system element relative to its influence on the definition of operational equipment and procedures. This includes assumption of scientific data objectives, as initiated by a principal investigator (PI)."
"It is hypothesized that the actual final cost and time required to develop a new technological system can be forecast from initially negotiated costs and times and other administrative details that are available when the contract is negotiated. This hypothesis was tested by examining multiple regressions of total cost and time as functions of data available at the end of negotiations for 73 contracts administered by one division of the Air Force."
"The problem of allocating funds to a number of R&D laboratories under the control of a federal or central agency is considered, which is a two-stage decision-making process involving the optimal selection of projects within laboratories and allocation of budgets to the laboratories by the federal organization. An analytical method, based upon the concept of `equitable dissatisfaction,' is presented for solving the problem. A numerical example is given to illustrate the application of the model."
 "IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management is intended as a medium of communication between managers of such technical functions as Research, Development, and Engineering, and people studying these activities systematically. Contributions are invited on all aspects of these activities in industry, government, university, or other settings. Of particular interest are studies carried on within an organization, e.g., an industrial company or government laboratory, to help in decision making or policy formation for RD&E. In such cases, the editorial staff is available to advise on treatment of the data to protect proprietary or security interests."

"IEEE Committee on Social Implications of Technology purposes: 1. Develop means to encourage and support professional and social responsibility in the practice of engineering. 2. Promote sensitivity to and understanding of the interaction between technology and society. 3. Foster study, discussion and appropriate action involving IEEE members and others. 4. Promoteote the conception of means and Implernent programs for predicting and evaluating the impact of technology on society. 5. Take appropriate action to implement programs."
"This first issue of the Newsletter reflects, to some degree, a new trend of thought emerging withing the IEEE itself and in the awareness of concerned technical professionals everywhere. As the modern world becomes both smaller and more technologically sophisticated every day, it has become increasingly apparent that the isolated decisions made by scientists and engineers have repercussions far beyond the labs and drawing boards where they were originally conceived. The application or misapplication of our creative engineering energies and the confusion over social priorities has aroused controversy and concern among a growing number of members of the engineering fraternity. The IEEE has attempted to respond to this concern by creating such groups as the AdHoc Committee on the Application of Electro-technology to Social Problems, as well as by advocating changes in the present Constitution which would allow the Institute as a whole greater latitude in areas of professional interest. The AdHoc Committee on Social Implications of Technology, stemming originally from a petition signed by over 400 interested IEEE members, is the newest outgrowth of this effort. CSIT is committed to providing a forum in which all IEEE members, as well as other experts in non-technical fields such as law, economics and the social sciences, may express their thoughts concerning the social, ethical, medical, legal and moral implications of the present course of the engineering discipline. In the coming months such diverse issues as electronic warfare, environmental pollution, urban crime, communication and transportation, electronic surveillance, governmental and private data banks, and engineering and health problems will all be discussed. There will also be notices of meetings, lectures and discussion groups, publication of papers and articles, reviews of pertinent bibliographical data and finally, personal commentary. In some respects we recognize that this may be a new departure from the traditional role of a technical organization, but we feel that the time is ripe, and a new awareness of the responsibility of the engineer to his society, and to himself, is long overdue."
 "The chairman of CSIT's Working Group on Bibliography, Ted Wernts, attended the national meeting of the American Chemical Society this summer. He reports on the new initiatives taken by that group in re-assessing the traditional relationships of the chemists to his employer, and to the effects his products has on the society as a whole:"
"The activities described in the introduction to this Newsletter will successful only insofar as they stimulate personal involvement the part of the IEEE members. It is important therefore to find out what the membership considers appropriate for discussions and study and how many are interested enough to really participate. Following is a list of general topics and specific sub-topics. It is recognized that the short titles are subject to various interpretations and that other IEEE organs are already studying some of them. In order to get started, however, we request that you scale each of the 12 categories from 1 to 5, in the order of your special interest and in which you believe you have skills which can and should be brought to bear on behalf of society; note that 1 signifies definite interest, 5 none at all. Please star any of the sub-topics of special appeal. You may also wish to add a note suggesting any additional topics; negative as well as positive responses are, of course, invited."
"The Working Group on the Bibliography, is assembling material to be published by the IEEE as a bibliography on the Social Implications of Technology.1 The immediate need is for items for inclusion — will all interested members please submit any title or titles they feel would be valuable. No decision has been made on whether the bibliography should be annotated, and any suggestions as to format would be welcome."

 "OUR Group's Conference on the Psychology of Technical Communications, held in Philadelphia this past February, served to dramatically display the widening scope of professional communications. Just as the many disciplines of science and engineering are merging to an extent where boundaries are obscured, so have the subdivisions of communications overlapped to a point where distinctions become very difficult. John Phillips, now our President, organized the Conference into its three major sessions: Communications among Engineers and Scientists, Communications to Engineers and Scientists, and Communications from Engineers and Scientists. The list of speakers included, in addition to professional communicators who specialize in the support and education of technical personnel, workers in the field of sociology, psychology, and communications research."
"This paper demonstrates that the need for better communication in science and technology is part of a larger collective need for communication systems in every area of man's endeavors and developments. Second, due to the nature of knowledge, an argument is made for the necessity of a “superstructure” capable of structuring knowledge in a way analogous to man's facility of understanding. Communication in science and technology is then seen as the ongoing internal maturation of the mosaic of the superstructure which then serves us as a powerful tool for communicating, applying, and furthering knowledge. The conclusion is that the necessary superstructure is attainable only through a collective development which would not only satisfy the communication needs of this group, but of every group in need of better communication systems."
"An eclectic combination of analyses in all related disciplines should advance the study of interpersonal communication systems. Study results already derived from many disciplines still are inconclusive. In this paper, the application of the theory of communication circuits to levels of intersubjective understanding is explored."
"Interprofessional communication depends largely on the specialist's ability to assess and make allowance for the cross-cultural distance between himself and his audience. This distance is composed mainly of differences in basic preoccupations, assumptions, purposes, methods, and terminologies. The most effective bridges consist of generalizations to which a minimum number of qualifications are applied, and in which jargon and clutter are near zero. The general equation of the first degree for the effectiveness of communication when the message is technical is as follows:"
"In spite of instant intercontinental communication by satellite and computer, there are still barriers to efficient information transfer and attainment of comprehensive awareness between scientists/technologists in different countries. The tremendous growth rare of technology has, in fact, brought new problems in its wake. These are grouped under seven headings: language, overpopulation, pollution, jargon, time, economics, and migration. Each of these is briefly examined and its consequence discussed. The language problem is dynamic and keeps changing with time. There is increasing overpopulation of papers; rehash and abstracts all contributing to pollution and diffusion of data. Noise is getting worse due to redundant data, wrong indexing, etc. For years, a jargon explosion has been going on without control. There are too many built-in delays in the conventional publication-translation-processing-search-feedback chain. Information search is hampered by overpopulation and pollution. Most methods of communication have become more expensive with passage of time, while budgets at both company and national level have become tighter. In this age of rapid innovation, scientists and engineers keep changing their field of work and job location, delaying and making less effective attempts at direct communication."
"A comparison between the models of scientific communication and mass communication is made in terms of the basic components in the communication processes. Differences between the two models are emphasized so that the sources of ineffective communication can be identified. Several suggestions are made to bridge the communication gaps between science, technology, and the public."
"In interviews, 161 polymer scientists gave detailed accounts of their most recent experiences with each of nine different kinds of encounters with scientific information. One of these kinds was information obtained “accidentally.” Half of the messages described in the accounts were obtained while the scientist was pursuing some other information; about one-quarter were told him by a colleague with whom he was in contact for another purpose; about one-tenth were brought to his attention by a colleague who deliberately sought him out for this purpose. The circumstances that led to these information transactions will be examined together with the scientist's own assessment of the impact of the message on his work. Attention will be called to implications for current-awareness activities and services."
"The author feels that abstracting offers the writer of reports unique intrinsic values, making him a better disciplined writer. One value derives as he analyzes the relationships, totality, order, and import of his ideas. Another arises as he shows through transitions those analyzed characteristics of his ideas. These values are cumulative."
"A large number of conferences and short courses are held throughout the world each year. Although these two important types of educational meetings bring together a great deal of technical talent, the actual transfer of information often falls far short of expectations. This paper reviews the basic functions that comprise the overall structure of these learning activities, and cites examples of specific problems. From an examination of the framework of these educational functions, a number of easily implemented and realistic guidelines are proposed for improving their quality."
"THE EXISTENCE and makeup of this group seems to challenge a statement made recently by Derek de Solla Price. As many of you may know, Derek Price is Avalon Professor of the History of Science at Yale, and he has done considerable work in the how and why of scientific communication, especially as regards the literature. After a preliminary analysis of the use of scientific and technical journals, Price concluded that scientists write but don't read, while engineers read but don't write. That's an oversimplification, no doubt, but I suspect there may be more than a mere grain of truth in it. If there is, I'm obviously left with the problem of determining what an IEEE “Group on Professional Communication” is all about. One way of doing that was to try and discover what engineering journals are all about Setting out to do that, I realized that I'd have to first come to some acceptable definition of “engineer.” That's where I got stuck. Perhaps my difficulty with that definition has its roots in some of the same problems which suggested to the IEEE that a two-day conference on the “Psychology of Technical Communications” might be a good and useful thing."
"This paper deals with the process of coaching a new product development engineering team in the development of a new industrial product. It is assumed that the new product is directed at one of the existing markets of the business rather than at a new venture market; and further, that the market research on which the product is based is fundamentally sound. The methods described have been used for manufactured and assembled electrical, electronic, and mechanical products rather than those products produced by chemical process. The topics covered include: the psychology of coaching; the clarification of the design job and objectives; creating a climate in which the team members are responsive to management objectives and customer needs; identifying problems in the proposed design; reviewing design progress and problems; and working through problems and replanning the program. This paper gives examples and describes methods of communicating and documenting program objectives. It also outlines the responsibilities of marketing and general management in the process of developing new industrial products."
"Recent cuts in the defense budget and slackening of the economy have created significant unemployment among engineers. This unprecedented major reversal in the job market has confronted many engineers with problems they have never before faced. The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, starting in the spring of 1970, instituted a series of employment workshops to communicate the techniques, methods, and plan of attack to find jobs. These sessions achieved significant changes in attitude and motivation to help these engineers. This paper will present some observations, from these sessions, of the psychological blocks to logical thinking and how they can be overcome. Some specific case histories will be described and the results of a follow-up survey of the success of the participants of the Philadelphia workshops will be presented."
"Ideally the engineer and scientist will listen to the estimated needs of marketing, management and consumers. However, in the last few years they have been disenchanted and often alienated by unemployment, declining budgets, and the recession in general. Although communications to engineers and scientists will continue in the same form as before, they will be more responsive and cooperative as listeners and business associates. However, the engineer will be less tolerant, less friendly, and more concerned about his economic well being."
"IT IS a pleasure to have this opportunity to meet with the IEEE Group on Professional Communication in its first independent conference. As a specialist in communication theory and research, I am delighted to find we share so many common interests."

 "LAST YEAR was one of accomplishment for the Engineering Writing and Speech Group. The external evidence is a new name for the Group (Professional Communication), new constitution and bylaws, and greatly expanded fields of interest.1 Internally, the signs are more significant: there is increased participation by group members, new and old; ideas — some new, some old — are being offered and discussed; and more importantly, goals are being identified, established, and met."
"Careless handling of the overhead projector drains the communications value of presentations. The four most serious problems are: the keystone image; cluttered visuals; speaker blocking the image; and careless handling of the projectuals. These problems are discussed and simple solutions are offered in each case."
"Several suggestions are included here for the engineer who decides voluntarily to write a technical paper."
"This paper examines the nature of the small, informal type of group meeting involving persons assigned to a common project, the planning factors and sequence of steps for implementation, and the chairmanship characteristics essential to achieving effectiveness."
"Some typographic conventions relating to line composition and page makeup are presented in the context of the problems they pose to the designer of a computer program for typographic composition."
"The “Miss Thistlebottom” of the title is a composite of elementary school English teachers through the ages, the unfailing nemesis of the young individualist; the hobgoblins are the rules she laid down for English composition — some worthy, some archaic, but all to be strictly observed, whether or not they made for real communication. Using this ploy, Mr. Bernstein has produced a breezy exposé, liberally spiced with examples, of the taboos of writing whose relevance often has been lost in antiquity."
"If one were to construct a dictionary today for use in an information storage and retrieval system, it would seem almost appropriate to link the name Gerard Salton with the SMART system, for the two, in a way, are synonyms. Thus, to read of another publication by Salton about the SMART system is not a surprise: the new book continues the account of the SMART system begun earlier [1]."
 "Presents the front cover for this issue of the publication."
 "IN the March issue of this TRANSACTIONS, I had the privilege of outlining some of the 1972 goals for the Group on Professional Communication. Among these goals were a quarterly TRANSACTIONS, increased membership activity, more meetings, and stepped-up educational activities."
"Communication of consumer needs for scientific and engineering work through Requests for Proposal (RFP) often fails. The failure to communicate usually is caused by Requests for Proposal that describe the equipment, or means, to accomplish a given task rather than the task to be accomplished or end. This paper suggests that substitution of means for ends occurs because of habit, self esteem, time pressure, and failure to keep up with an accelerating technology on the part of the RFP writer. RFP's that describe the task to be accomplished may be expected to provide dividends to both sender and receiver."
"Psychophysics, in this paper, is used in its literal sense: the effect of physical processes upon the mental processes of an organism. Recent studies show that temperature fluctuations of the human body have a 24-hour periodicity that is reflected in the activity of organs and functions of the body, awake and asleep. The rise and fall of such activity is phased differently for different Individuals. It may become necessary to determine the most receptive and responsive time for each individual to engage in communicating, as well as other significant activities."
"During an effort to and promising lines of development for new products, it became necessary to find out from experienced production engineers what the greatest needs are in today's factories. As we worked cut a questionnaire to get ratings of items in an abstract description from respondent production engineers, we encountered considerable lack of cooperation, even though the respondents were in our own company. We found that the questionnaire had features that the respondent production engineers found irritating, and that many points explained in the text were completely missed by our respondents. As we incorporated the feedback, our questionnaire evolved from an abstract diagram accompanied by text to something resembling a programmed textbook in tabular and graphic form. The history seems to confirm the sterotypes about engineers: most of our respondents seemed impatient with abstractions and strongly disinclined to read text."
"I AM very happy to talk to you who are dedicating your careers to helping us improve our professional communication. It has been my good fortune to have had the help of Jim Lufkin and Herb Michaelson in my own work, and I am sure your group includes many competent and dedicated workers like theme."
"Instead of employing most of our communications professionals mainly as technical writers and editors, we should be encouraging them to apply their expertise in a much broader capacity. Rather than simply guide, advise and write for a handful of engineers or scientists, they should offer solid, practical training in communications and report writing to as many technical professionals as they can reach."
"This paper presents a general view of communication, and urges those who write on technical subjects to follow the `rules' in existing books of instruction. Expediency and custom are the basis of these most acceptable ways for presenting written and spoken messages of many kinds. Such suggestions can be very helpful for writers who want to communicate technical matters successfully. By following the recommendations given in guides like the seven listed in this paper, the author of a technical article is likely to please those who think form and correctness are important, to impress those who think nothing is important, and to be understood by all."
"To find out if writing really does help establish a reputation, and why some technical professionals write and some do not, a questionnaire was distributed to a sampling of authors and non-authors at 19 IBM development laboratories and manufacturing plants in the U.S. and Europe. Respondents were asked how many articles for professional journals and technical magazines, and how many conference papers they had written. The authors were then asked their principal reasons for writing; what, if any, benefits have come of it; and what they think are the relative advantages and disadvantages, to the author, of writing for journals, technical magazines and conferences. Non-authors in the sample were asked the principal reasons that have held them back from writing articles and papers. Results are given."
"When engineers and scientists think about communicating technical information to others, they seldom think about the psychology involved in the transfer of that information. They reason that if the subject is technical, the conclusions reached by the scientific method, and the technical language accurate, then there can be no lack of communication. But they are misunderstood: conclusions are misinterpreted, data is misused, and language is incomprehensible. How can the communication fail when they work only with the truth of data obtained in a research laboratory? Communication, like engineering and science, is both a craft and an art It is the disciplined exercise of the mind and an intuitive sense of proportion. It is requires the objectivity of a detached view of the subject matter and the subjectivity of an involvement with the design of the final product."
"This paper concerns itself with the problem of a communicator locating his audience in what is termed psychological or “meaning” space as the prelude to “facilitation of meaning” (which is suggested as the essence of human communication.) To this end, the dimensions of a universe of meaning or “meaning space,” which may be related to any topic or object of concern, are suggested, along with some measurement methods. The author discusses briefly the theoretical relationships inherent in the approach and the implications of those relationships for the user. He suggests that the approach is at odds with much that we have been taught about communication."
"Technical writing means many things to many people. The instructive literature for the field generally either emphasizes that portion of the field conforming to the author's interpretation or attempts to cover the entire field with general concepts and admonitions. Rarely does a book appear that covers as much, as clearly, and in as practical a manner as Technically — Write! by R. S. Blicq. Mr. Blicq is Head of the Industrial and Technology Communication Department at Red River Community College, in Winnepeg, Canada. He obviously has had extensive experience teaching technical communications and, in this text book, he speaks familiarly at the undergraduate level. More than this, his presentation holds a warmth and intimacy that is uncharacteristic of instructional literature: the professor is speaking to you in his classroom. Although the physical scientist and even the graduate engineer may tend to view the style as being below his level of sophistication, Mr. Blicq has packed almost every principle of clear technical exposition on the widest variety of communications in this 380-odd page book, along with “problems” in the form of work assignments at the end of each chapter. Even for the professional communicator, this book holds much of value as a reference when he is faced with an assignment in a portion of the field outside of his specialty."

"THE Joint Conference on Technology and Governance in Achieving Environmental Quality, held at Gaithersburg, Maryland on September 20, 21, and 22, was notable in several respects. It was the culmination of more than 18 months of planning on the part of a few individuals in IEEE and some of its sister professional societies to explore the possibilities for achieving compatibility between the capabilities of technologists and the wisdom of public administrators. It brought face-to-face, eminent engineers, scientists, administrators, and planners in environmental fields from societies ranging from IEEE, AIChE and AAAS to the American Institute of Planners, American Bar Association, American Medical Association, and the American Institute of Public Accountants. Participants came from government agencies as well as private organizations."
"In scientific and technical communication, intelligibility is primarily a cultural problem, to which carefully formulated generalizations, rather than streams of data, are the only solution. Preoccupation with simplicity, or clarity, or `correctness' is a poor substitute for a careful consideration of what the reader can and cannot be expected to understand. The writer who will overcome his prejudices against generalization in order to convey the concepts which his reader does not share with him should be able to communicate more effectively at three levels: (1) to his fellow specialists, (2) to specialists in other fields, and (3) to concerned laymen."
"Relationships in communication by sight, by sound, and by sound-plus-sight as a complex are presented in a three-part tree which specifies how technology is used in processes of imparting information. Applications of technology in making direct communication are indicated; the re-presentation of direct communications is shown as a set of technological processes (e.g., storage and play-back, or transmission and reception) with ideological reinforcement, and so is the reproduction of communications thus transformed or reconstituted (e.g. production of photographic, electronic, typeset, or coded copies). Storage and retrieval of reproduced copies are shown together, without methodological detail, as a separate, major aspect of communication, although they are considered to be part of the technological and ideological applications of re-presentation and reproduction. The tree was prepared for a technology forecasting project."
"Proposal schedules often are too short to permit adequate planning, good organization, and determination of the interactive effects of changes during preparation by the more commonly used methods. The storyboard technique, with its modular format, enforce a writing discipline that sharpens the message, uncovers gaps in continuity, and optimizes the balance in discussions of constituent topics. Overall visibility of the entire proposal usually can be accomplished, permitting rapid comprehension of the quality of organizational and production parameters, and the effect of changes on these. Proposals printed in the storyboard format are more interesting and easier to read."
"A seemingly universal phenomenon-a `failure to communicate' among scientists and engineers in a large and highly sophisticated work environment-was investigated using unobtrusive research measures. Questionnaires completed by scientists and engineers as a part of their normal work to evaluate a major contractor's performance were examined as to the type of responses. A 7500-word narrative sample from 9 scientists and 14 engineers was selected and analyzed by comparing the number of sentences per response, words per sentence, and sentence fragments, and by categorizing and counting the words that each group used to express positive or negative value. The findings indicate that scientists use more sentences and more words per sentence than do engineers; the engineers use more sentence fragments; and the two groups do not, for the most part, use the same words in evaluating a common situation. However, the content similarity of the evaluations suggests that the actual differences between scientists and engineers may be overestimated and over-emphasized."

"Proper maintenance will prolong the life of a battery and will aid in assuring that it is capable of supplying its design power requirements. A good battery maintenance program will serve as a valuable aid in determining the need for battery replacement. Station battery maintenance should be performed by personnel knowledgeable of batteries and the safety precautions involved."
"We show how the steady-state distribution and the mean squared error of a delta modulator with an ideal integrator can be computed exactly when the input signal to the modulator is a stationary Gaussian process with a rational power spectral density. Curves are presented for the mean squared error as a function of the quantizer step size and the sampling interval for several different input spectra. The mathematical development makes use of the Markov properties of the system and involves series ex-expansions in n-dimensional Hermite functions. The key integral equation is generalized to treat the case of a realizable filter in the feedback path, but an analytic method of solving this equation has not been found."
"A study of the stability of periodically driven nonlinear networks (mixers), motivated by recent work on low-noise down-conversion with Schottky barrier diodes, is presented. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the unconditional stability of a mixer are derived and discussed. It is shown that potential instability is always associated with the jump phenomenon in the sense that a mixer will (under suitable circumstances) exhibit the phenomenon if, and only if, the above stability conditions are violated. Application of these conditions to frequency multipliers is also discussed."
"We discuss the performance of a Schottky barrier diode as a mixer when the barrier of the diode is open-circuited at the harmonics 2ωo, 3ωo, etc. of the pump frequency ωo. Such a mixer is shown to be capable of arbitrarily high conversion gain provided $\\omega_{c} \\geqq \\eta\\omega_{o},$ where ωc, is the cutoff frequency of the diode and η is a parameter that is typically less than 6.25 and approaches 4 under certain ideal conditions. It is shown that the limit imposed by the series resistance of the diode on the double-sideband noise figure of the mixer is given by $F_{m} > \\left(1 - \\eta {\\omega_{o} \\over \\omega_{c}\\right)^{-1}.$ An experiment is described at 1.25 GHz on a room temperature mixer whose double-sideband noise figure Fm as a function of gain has a minimum of about 0.7 dB (for gain less than unity) and a maximum of about 2.3 dB (for high gain)."
"The concept of a generalized renewal process is used to derive an asymptotic approximation for the variance of the observed proportion of unsuccessful attempts on a trunk group during a given time-interval. Calls are assumed to arrive according to a general renewal process, and those which are blocked leave the system and do not return (loss system). As an application of our result we examine the special case of an overflow input–an important example from telephone networks with alternate routing. Comparison of our results with values obtained from simulation indicates that the approximation is quite accurate for telephone traffic-engineering purposes."
"Considering the earthquake susceptibility of structures located in seismic regions, the question arises as to what level of protective measures should be provided in order to achieve a certain degree of reliability against possible damage. To address this question, engineering risk and optimal design of structures located in a seismic area are studied. The basic concept is to obtain a tradeoff between the cost of providing a protective measure and the expected cost of earthquake damage. A simple mathematical approach is presented to determine the optimal earthquake intensity which the structure is designed to withstand. The objective is to minimize the total construction cost of the structure plus the expected cost of earthquake damage throughout the entire service life of the structure. For the case of deterministic structural resistance, and for structural response processes having Poisson (independent) crossings, an objective function is derived in terms of the building and earthquake variables. The optimal design intensity can then be determined by minimizing the objective function with respect to the intensity variable. The resulting equations are relatively simple and can be easily handled for numerical studies and sensitivity analysis. Generalizations of the results for nondeterministic structural resistance and for structural response processes different from those having Poisson crossings are also indicated. As an illustration of the proposed approach, a hypothetical building with realistic seismicity and structural parameters is analyzed for its optimal design earthquake intensity. The construction, damage and total costs are obtained in terms of the intensity variable. The implications and sensitivity of the results are also discussed."
 "Measurements have been made to determine the efficiency of coupling light from GaAs injection lasers (λ = 9000 Å) of stripe geometry into the cores of optical fibers. Laser light was coupled into a fiber across a small air gap which separated the laser from the fiber. The power coupling efficiency was calculated by extrapolating the lasing light power emitted at the end of a short length of fiber back to its input tip and comparing it with the total laser beam power. Experiments were performed with several diffused junction (DJ) lasers and with low-threshold double-heterostructure (DH) lasers having stripes formed by proton bombardment or oxide masking. The beam profile, scanned in its near and far field region, was approximately Gaussian. The beam dimensions at the surface of the laser were estimated from far field measurements and were used to predict the coupling efficiency of single-mode and multimode fibers. Power coupling efficiencies of about 70 percent were measured for DJ lasers feeding 10-µm multimode fibers. A coupling efficiency of 25 percent, almost identical to the theoretical estimate, was achieved with a DH laser having a 1-µm × 13-µm proton-bombarded stripe, feeding the 3.2-µm core of a single-mode fiber. The coupling efficiency was greater than 40 percent when a DJ laser fed the same fiber. A cylindrical lens is proposed to increase the power coupling perpendicular to the junction plane. Permanent self-supporting couplers were made by applying epoxy between structures which supported the fiber and the laser."
"This paper reports on extensive eigenvalue measurements made on an X-band waveguide Y-junction containing different ferrite geometries. The frequency dependence of the eigenvalues is used to identify the principal field modes involved, to examine their sensitivities to various junction parameters, and to arrange their correct displacement for circulation. The knowledge gained from these measurements is used to explain the mode of operation of the partial height ferrite Y-junction circulator, and to introduce other novel configurations."
"This paper is concerned with the following mathematical problem. Let X denote a stationary time-discrete random process whose variables, …, X−1, X0, X1, …, take values from the finite set of real numbers {x1, x2, …, xk}. Let X have mean zero and a given covariance sequence pk = EXiXi+k, j, k = 0, ±1, ±2, …. What is the largest entropy that X can have and what is the probability structure of this most random process of given second moments?"
"Two similar dynamic shift register schemes have recently been proposed, the insulated-gate-field-effect transistor (IGFET) version of the bucket-brigade register and the charge-coupled device (CCD). These charge-transfer dynamic shift registers show great promise for many digital and analog applications because of their small size and simplicity. In this paper the fabrication, performance, and drive characteristics of the registers are considered in detail to bring out common and comparative capabilities, the discussion being supplemented with presently available experimental data. In order to be specific in comparing the two devices, we assume 10-micrometer metallization tolerances and emphasize digital rather than analog operation of the registers. In addition, a refractory gate technology with two levels of metallization has been assumed so that the devices can be compared using similar technologies. With respect to the common capabilities, it is found that the registers have several significant advantages over other existing shift register schemes — a minimum of processing steps leading to areas of under 3 mil2 per bit, with the possibility of areas down to 1.1 mil2 per bit using a refractory gate technology; operation up to frequencies of 10 MHz p-channel or 50 MHz n-channel; and power requirements under 5 µW per bit at a clock frequency of 1 MHz, power varying approximately linearly with clock frequency. From a comparative point of view, it is found that the charge-coupled device and the IGFET bucket brigade are so similar that area limitations, voltage, current, and power requirements, and high- and low-frequency operating limitations arise from the same mechanisms and hence are essentially the same within less than a factor of two. There appear to be only two major differences. First, the fabrication requirements are somewhat different. The CCD requires no diffusions in its active region and may be less sensitive to mask realignment when two levels of metallization are available. However,"
"Properties of various charge-coupled device (CCD) configurations are investigated by means of a computer model. The model is based on a numerical solution of the Poisson equation for a unit cell of the CCD structure. The surface potential and the tangential surface electric field are obtained to an estimated accuracy of one percent and used to calculate transfer characteristics. On this basis various devices are compared as a function of both geometrical and electrical parameters. The geometrical parameters include oxide thickness, gap length, and electrode length. The electrical parameters include such things as doping density, fixed interface charge, and applied voltage. The influence of surface states is omitted from the treatment. The principal results indicate that (i) for dimensions of practical interest electrode lengths of the same order as the interelectrode spacings are desirable, (ii) moderately thick oxides enhance the tangential surface electric fields and increase the effectiveness of the channel-stop diffusion, (iii) lightly doped p-substrates are more resistant to the formation of electrostatic barriers in the gaps and yield faster devices because p-type conductivity silicon has a higher minority carrier mobility, and (iv) fixed charge at the Si-SiO2 interface can have a significant influence on the device characteristics. It is concluded that proper choice of both geometrical and electrical parameters is essential in obtaining optimum CCD performance; however, for such an optimized design, the transfer efficiency is for all practical purposes not limited by electrostatic considerations and is probably limited only by surface states. Theoretical limits of transfer efficiency based on these calculations are reported."
"The spectral and temporal characteristics of a narrowband radio channel subject to multipath fading were estimated from a detailed sampling of channel loss variations. The data base for this characterization was obtained during a 59-day experiment in which the amplitudes of a set of coherent tones spanning a band of 33.55 MHz and centered at 6034.2 MHz were continuously monitored. The more significant observations were: (i) For fade depths less than 30 dB the frequency selectivity is accurately described by linear and quadratic components (in frequency) of amplitude distortion. The derived statistical distributions of such distortion parameters exhibit slopes of a decade of decrease in probability of occurrence for each 10 dB increase in distortion, for bandwidths greater than 5 MHz. (ii) For fade depths greater than 30 dB and bandwidths in excess of 5 MHz the amplitude distortion exceeds second order. (iii) Maximum observed rates of change for the linear and quadratic distortion were 90 and 60 dB/second, respectively."
"The exact formulae (calculable to any accuracy) for mutual and conductor-to-ground capacitance (Cm, and Cg) for a shielded balanced pair are expressed as infinite determinants. Convergence of these determinants is rapid except as the conductors of the pair approach each other or the shield. Approximate expressions developed by Philips Research, though not extremely accurate, are simple and in closed form thereby allowing capacitance surfaces to be plotted. These surfaces show qualitatively the variation of capacitance with dimensions."
"We present a technique, called the Equivalent Group method, for estimating the capacities of partial-access service systems which carry overflow traffic. The basic idea is to find a full-access group which has the same capacity as the partial-access system when the arrival process is Poisson. We consider these groups to be “equivalent” and use the capacity of the full-access group when it is offered overflow traffic to estimate the capacity of the partial-access group if it is offered the same overflow traffic. The Equivalent Group method is used to estimate the capacity of Step-by-Step graded multiples which carry overflow traffic. The resulting procedures can account for day-to-day variations in the offered load, and the computations can be carried out by appropriate use of existing engineering tables."
 "The Bell System emphasis on burying the transmission media plant directly in the soil resulted in the initiation of a study in 1956 designed to determine the behavior of commercial and experimental materials in the soil. For this study, two test sites representative of soils of large sections of the country were employed: one in Bainbridge, Georgia, and the other in Roswell, New Mexico, typical acid and alkaline soils, respectively. The soil characteristics, test plot design, sample preparation, installation and removal schedules, and overall areas of responsibilities are discussed in this paper. A detailed discussion of the effect of up to eight years of soil burial exposure on molded plastics, casting resins, rubbers and metal-to-rubber bonds, electrical and structural laminates, adhesives, tapes, and coated conductors are covered in companion papers. The history of the problems with buried structures and the engineering implications are stressed."
"An evaluation of the effect of soil burial on a wide variety of thermoplastic and thermoset plastic molding compounds has been completed for specimens interred eight years at the soil burial test plots in Georgia and New Mexico. In general, the effect of soil environment has been mild on most of the molded plastics. The most significant changes occur to those materials most sensitive to moisture. These changes take place independently of either burial site or depth of soil burial (6 and 18 inches)."
"Styrene-polyester and epoxy casting formulations have been used in the Bell System for over ten years and have a minimum service life requirement of twenty years. The styrene-polyester formulation is a filled phthalic maleic/diethylene glycol ester catalyzed with methyl ethyl ketone peroxide and is by far the most stable and least affected by eight years of soil contact or aging. Two epoxy formulations, unfilled and silica-filled, have the same base diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A resin which is cured with a proprietary epoxy adduct of diethylene triamine. After eight years, unfilled specimens from both burial sites were not significantly degraded but the flexural strength of buried silica-filled specimens was reduced by approximately 40 percent within the first year and then remained relatively constant for the following seven years."
"Twenty-three types of unclad laminates based on phenolic, melamine, silicone, epoxy, and polyester resins were examined after exposure in alkaline soil at Roswell, New Mexico, and in acid soil at Bainbridge, Georgia. The laminates have initial insulation resistance values ranging from 1.4 × 106 to less than 30 megohms. Each suffers a large decrease in insulation resistance upon exposure. The percentage decrease can be in excess of 90 percent after four years underground exposure in New Mexico or Georgia. Moderate decreases in flexural strengths also were observed."
"This paper is a summary of the effects of long-term soil burial on the properties of reinforced plastic laminates. The interactions of reinforcement, resin, and fabrication technique, as they relate to the laminates' ability to resist the effects of soil burial, are discussed. The method of soil burial attack is explained. Recommendations for the best laminate construction and methods of protection from the soil environment are made. These include: (i) Where there is a need for a laminate structure with the maximum initial mechanical properties and the largest percent retention of these values, a fully cured laminate with fiberglass cloth reinforcement and an epoxy resin matrix is recommended. (ii) Laminates made with an epoxy resin matrix or a polyester resin matrix show the same rate of degradation due to soil burial. (iii) The use of resin-rich face plies in a sandwich construction with fiberglass chopped strand mat (FCSM) as the core plies showed better resistance to the effects of soil burial than does an all-FCSM laminate."
"This paper describes the studies that have been made on polyethylene and vinyl chloride plastic wire and cable coatings after up to eight years soil burial at sites in Georgia and New Mexico. The initial samples of both types of plastics were exposed in the form of extruded wire while the more recent studies on vinyl plastics have been made on molded sheet. The polyethylenes were observed to have excellent resistance to deterioration, but certain of them may be susceptible to adverse changes in physical properties that appear to be associated with polymer crystallization. The vinyl plastics vary in their resistance to deterioration, depending primarily upon the choice of plasticization. Compositions of both types of plastics can be prepared that may be expected to provide satisfactory long-term service as wire or cable coatings in a soil environment."
"Vulcanized rubber and polyethylene coated wires, molded specimens, and rubber-to-metal bonded test samples were buried in both alkaline and acid soils to determine the effects of these environments. Results show that: (i) Most wire samples suffered a loss in insulation resistance, but retained their physical strength. (ii) Insect and rodent chewing have caused varying test results in the dumbbell-shaped molded samples. (iii) Rubber-to-metal bonds have failed due to corrosion in most samples using aluminum and cold-rolled steel, while stainless steel samples have retained strong bonds. The adhesion of insulations to aluminum conductors has also failed. (iv) Black, chemically crosslinked polyethylene has been essentially unaffected by soil exposure. Soil burial test exposures of improved and more recent materials are continuing."
"The effects of long-term soil burial on some physical properties of adhesive bonded test specimens and pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes are presented. Changes in these measured properties are discussed and interpreted in terms of typical material characteristics. Additionally, the engineering implications of these changes are explored. Such implications include: (i) Adhesive bonding appears to be a satisfactory means of fastening structures together for direct soil burial; however, care must be exercised to insure proper joint design and bonding procedures. (ii) Both rubber and vinyl pressure-sensitive tapes provide sufficient retention of properties for prolonged underground service, but glass cloth and aluminum backed tape should be used only for temporary service."
"The preceding papers have presented detailed coverage of soil burial effects on specific classes of organic materials. This paper summarizes some of the trends which have emerged in the eight years of soil exposure in both acid and alkaline soil: (i) High-density and black crosslinked polyethylenes, rigid PVCs, acrylics, polycarbonates, acetates, fluorocarbons, styrene polyesters, unfilled epoxy, neoprene without clay, and sulfur-cured nitrile rubber have been essentially unaffected. (ii) Insect attack is confined to the soft forms of materials such as cellulosics, rubbers, and thermoplastics, specifically low-density polyethylene and certain plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) samples. All cast resins, structural laminates, and hard thermosetting plastics have been completely free of insect attack. (iii) With both plastics and elastomers, significant losses in tensile strength are almost always accompanied by large decreases in insulation resistance. (iv) Some plastic materials tend to increase in tensile strength due to the loss of constituents while some lose strength because of chemical breakdown. The reinforced thermosetting materials decrease in strength because of moisture penetration along the resin-fiber bond. (v) Of the plasticized PVC wire insulations, the materials with trioctyl and octyl diphenyl phosphate, and dioctyl adipate blend, have shown significant increases in modulus indicative of plasticizer loss due to teaching and/or microbial consumption."
"Waiting time jitter is a low-frequency phase jitter introduced whenever asynchronous digital signals are synchronized for multiplexing by pulse stuffing. It contains arbitrarily low frequency components and cannot be completely removed from the demultiplexed signals. In this paper the spectrum of waiting time jitter is derived, and supporting experimentally recorded waiting time jitter spectra are presented. A question of much engineering interest is at what rate waiting time jitter accumulates in a chain of multiplexer-demultiplexer pairs. A calculation based on the theoretical waiting time jitter spectrum shows that under reasonable conditions the rate at which the rms amplitude of the accumulated waiting time jitter grows is no greater than the square root of the number of multiplexer-demultiplexer pairs. Experimental data consistent with this upper bound are given."
"The coupled line equations for two modes traveling in the same direction are considered. The covariances of the mode transfer functions are calculated in the case of random coupling. Exact results are obtained when the coupling is a function of a finite state Markov chain, and also when the coupling is white noise. Perturbation results are obtained in the case of weak, zero mean, wide sense stationary coupling. It is also shown that perturbation results are valid in the case of strong coupling, if the correlation length is short."
"The modes of a multimode dielectric waveguide are coupled by imperfections of the waveguide structure. The propagation of the coupled modes is described by coupled wave equations involving the wave amplitudes. If the coupling functions are random variables the interaction between the modes can be described more easily by coupled power equations. The derivation of the coupled power equations from the coupled wave equations is accomplished with the help of perturbation theory."
"Data are generated at a fairly uneven rate when video telephone signals are coded by transmitting only the parts of the picture that change from frame to frame. Complete smoothing of these data is impracticable because of the size of the required buffer. Obviously, even a small buffer provides some advantage however. The object of this paper is to explore the relation between buffer requirements and channel rate under varying experimental conditions. The study was made by recording three minutes of data (covering a range of action) on a digital computer and simulating buffer behavior for various channel rates and operating conditions. With little or no buffering, a large rate is necessary. As the size of the buffer is increased, the required channel rate typically decreases quite rapidly until the buffer is large enough to smooth the data over an entire field. Beyond this point there is relatively little improvement until the buffer is large enough to smooth the data generated by a moving user from one movement to the next. At times data are generated at a faster rate than can be handled by the buffer-channel combination. Reduction of the rate of data generation during these periods can be controlled either by using the amount of activity in the picture as a control or by using the state of the buffer as a control. Both methods have distinctly different effects on the buffer-size versus channel-rate curve. The two modes of control can be effectively combined in developing a successful control strategy. The buffer size required to achieve within-field smoothing can be reduced dramatically if the data within the field are not taken in the order in which these data are generated but instead are interleaved in a systematic manner; this is because of the nonuniform rate of data generation within a field."
"Simulations are described which test the feasibility of several conditional replenishment type Picturephone coders sharing the same transmission channel. Channel sharing takes advantage of the fact that many different users are rarely in rapid motion at the same time. Thus, when the data from several sources is averaged together prior to transmission, it is much more uniform than that from a single source. Since the peaks in the averaged data are smaller than with a single source, less buffering is required, and the channel rate required for transmission is much closer to the average data rate generated. Results indicate that by combining twelve sources prior to transmission, a 2:1 reduction in the bit rate of the system described by Candy, et al.,1 can be obtained. This means that twelve Picturephone sources could share a 12 megabits per second (one way) transmission facility."
"Consider a manufacturing process, such as the production of complex semiconductor devices, which consists of the sequential application of n possibly unreliable operations, t1, t2, · · ·, n. Let ci be the cost incurred in performing operation ti, and let pi be the probability that ti will be performed successfully. Clearly one would prefer to reject immediately any item as soon as a faulty operation has been performed upon it in order to avoid the unnecessary cost of further processing that item. For this purpose, we shall assume that, immediately following each operation ti, it is possible to apply a perfectly reliable test Ti, for determining whether or not the item should be rejected at that point, where the cost incurred by applying Ti depends only upon the point i of test application and the last previous point at which such a test was applied. Since the application of tests entails additional costs, careful analysis is required to determine which tests are sufficiently useful to justify that additional cost. Using a dynamic programming approach, we derive a useful and efficient algorithm which utilizes the test and operation costs, along with the operation failure probabilities, to determine a set of testing points which will result in the minimal expected manufacturing cost. We then show how it is possible to further improve upon our algorithm for the particular case in which all test costs depend only upon the point of test application."
"The general conditions for reducing the third-order transfer function of a twin-T by one are derived using Euclid's algorithm. The conditions presently used impose narrower constraints than necessary on the twin-T, thus leaving fewer free parameters to optimize the circuit. With the new method the zeros of the twin-T transfer function can be placed in both the left- and the right-half s-plane. The advantages of the twin-T with additional free parameters in second-order RC-active filters are appreciable. For example, in the medium-selectivity frequency-emphasizing network (MSFEN), the gain needed to realize a given pole Q may be up to 70 times smaller than that required with previous methods, while the stability of the pole is improved typically by a factor of 2. Thus, an MSFEN with the general second-order twin-T is capable of realizing a wider range of pole Q's than was possible previously, while the sensitivity of the pole Q is reduced."
 "Bellcomm was established early in 1962 in response to a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) request to the Bell System for technical support of the manned space flight programs at the NASA Headquarters level. It was a small company, reaching a peak of 500 people in 1969, and was jointly owned by American Telephone and Telegraph Company and Western Electric Company. The initial cadre of technical people was drawn mainly from Bell Laboratories and Western Electric, with the administrative staff drawn mainly from Western Electric and the Operating Companies."
 "A variational model is used to calculate the static stability limits and equilibrium properties of “half-bubbles,” magnetic domains residing on one surface of a magnetic bubble material platelet. Stability is achieved through the presence of gradients in the domain wall energy density and/or saturation magnetic moment. The model evidences two distinct types of instability behavior separated by a critical value of the wall energy density gradient. Unlike the standard cylindrical domain, the half-bubble has a minimum stable value of the ratio of domain diameter to height. The half-bubble is shown to possess a number of properties which make it potentially useful for device applications. It is self-biased by its closure wall and in some cases is stable in zero external bias. Bias margins are of the same order as those for the standard cylindrical domain. It stabilizes on only one platelet surface, and its properties are independent of both material thickness and of minor irregularities on the second surface. In addition, its structure may be advantageous in avoiding the undesirable properties of hard bubbles."
"A statistical analysis of nationwide seismic activities is made to determine the level and characteristics of earthquake motions to be expected in different geographical locations. Such information is needed to identify the severity of the earthquake threat to telephone facilities and to specify adequate design requirements. This paper describes the essential seismic environment including the expected earthquake-magnitude levels and the corresponding frequency of occurrence for different seismic-risk zones, and the free-field and in-building motions that might be induced by earthquakes. Stochastic models are used to analyze the earthquake-occurrence statistics, and to describe the induced random ground motions. Historical earthquake data are used to verify the theory and to generate information useful for seismic design."
"This paper is concerned with the study of data multiplexing techniques which provide local distribution for user populations whose source characteristics may be categorized as Inquiry/Response. The techniques studied are Polling, Random Access, and a Loop System. In each method a group of users is multiplexed onto the same line which is connected to a Central Processor. The Central Processor forms the interface between the local system and long haul facilities, but does no computation on arriving messages other than to route them appropriately. The advantage of such systems is flexibility of operation and economy through sharing of equipment at the Central Processor. We focus our attention on the average round-trip message delay and use this as a measure for comparisons of the three techniques. Source models, in terms of calls per busy hour and number of bits per message for users as well as for computer responses, are developed which are appropriate in an Inquiry/Response context. Other factors taken into consideration are transmission rates, synchronization delay time, and allocation of available capacity to the transmission of overhead information, such as polling messages and acknowledgment traffic. The results of the study are presented in graphic form, where the average delay due to traffic in the system is plotted as a function of the number of stations. Principal conclusions can be summarized as follows: Polling — It is found that this system is sensitive to the synchronization delay which takes place each time a user station transmits to the central facility. For reasonable choices of system parameters as many as 100 stations can share the Central Processor without exceeding an average of 1-second round trip message delay. Random Access — This system is not sensitive to synchronization delay. Over most of the range of load parameters, the Random Access system shows lower average delay than the other two systems. Loop System — The study revealed that this system has average delay"
"This paper analyzes the start-up performance of automatic transversal equalizers when maximum-length pseudo-random sequences of short periods are selected as the training signals for fast start-up purposes. Single-sideband Nyquist systems are considered because they represent the limiting case of vestigial-sideband systems with small excess bandwidth. It is shown that the equalizer is capable of fast start-up except in some rare situations which can be avoided by using proper timing, phase, and equalizer initial settings. The results also show that the equalizer tap convergence rate is independent of the phase characteristic of the communication channel and of the choice of the pseudo-random sequences which have the same period. The equalizer is set up in the training period by minimizing the mean-square error between the equalizer output and the transmitted pseudo-random sequence, which is different from the mean-square error for random data. Surprisingly, we have found that, even for pseudo-random sequences of very short periods, this start-up algorithm results in only a slight degradation in system performance. Accordingly, good system performance can be expected immediately after the system switches from the training mode to the data mode."
"Active filters have recently acquired widespread use in the realization of frequency-selective networks. Unlike their passive counterparts, active filters have the potential of oscillating. Furthermore, it has been observed that the onset of oscillations in biquad active filters is dependent upon signal level. This led to the recognition that nonlinear stability theory would be necessary to comprehend this behavior. This paper develops a technique to analyze the stability of networks containing linear and nonlinear elements interconnected in multifeedback structures. This is accomplished by extending the concept of the “Describing Function” to include networks containing nonlinearities with frequency-dependent linear feedback. The technique is then applied to explain qualitatively and quantitatively nonlinear effects in op-amps and their relation to the stability of frequency-selective networks containing them (e.g., the Multiple Amplifier Biquad, MAB, and the Single Amplifier Biquad, SAB). The technique is also applied to explain frequency shifts in amplitude-limited oscillators. The most valuable result of this analysis is the discovery of nonlinear feedback circuits which circumvent the conditional stability of high-frequency biquads. This has allowed us to obtain Q's of 50 at 100 kHz in a MAB employing 709 op amps. Similarly, a MAB employing 702 op amps was made to operate at 2 MHz with a Q of 10."
"Analytical predictions of the power handling capabilities of waveguide systems generally have not considered the effects of high average power and long pulse length. It has experimentally been noted, however, that a substantial reduction in power handling capability below expected levels does occur as average power and pulse length are increased. This reduction can be attributed to the presence of loose particulate matter which is heated by the average power, causing localized rarefication of the dielectric gas fill as well as the expected voltage enhancement. An unstable arcing situation is shown to exist when the arc duration exceeds some critical time. Typical pulse lengths in use today exceed this critical time and may result in continuous arcing. The use of control circuitry to terminate each particle-induced arc prevents continuous arcing and deletes the particle, and is therefore essential to stable operation at long pulse lengths and high average power."
 "In this paper we consider some questions of implementation of a scheme described in Section V of Ref. 1 for addressing message blocks in the Pierce loop system.2 The scheme consists of using a stream of binary digits (0 and 1) as the address of the destination loop of a message such that the scalar product∗ of the address with a stream of binary digits of equal length stored at a loop gives the distance between the loop and the destination. The message is routed along a path that minimizes distance between source and destination. The binary streams used in this scheme can be obtained by factoring the distance matrix D of the graph representing the connection of loops into two binary-valued matrices P and Q such that $D = PQ^{t},$ where the superscript “t” stands for matrix transposition. The fcth row of P represents the address to be prefixed to a message destined for loop k. The fcth row of Q represents a binary sequence to be stored in loop k. The scheme discussed in Section V of Ref. 1 provides a particular way of factoring D. For completeness, we give a description of that factorization as follows."
"R. L. Graham and H. O. Pollak recently proposed an addressing scheme to J. R. Pierce's Loop Switching Network — a network system which would exploit the one-way nature of much data transmission. Our paper provides a generalization of the scheme and proposes a new approach to certain unanswered questions."
"In this paper we examine the accuracy of a variant of the depletion layer approximation as used in the analysis of the electrostatic potential, in the absence of mobile charge, in various charge coupled devices. The approximation is a linearization of the nonlinear potential equations and is important in the numerical solution of two-dimensional problems. A one-dimensional model is solved both exactly and by means of the depletion layer approximation and the two results are compared. We conclude that this variant of the depletion layer approximation is excellent for buried channel devices, and adequate though not as good for surface devices. Some criteria are given which indicate the excellence of the approximation and can be used to estimate errors in two-dimensional calculations."
"It has previously been shown that by adding a pseudo-random “dither” noise to a signal to be quantized, and by subtracting an identical noise sequence from the quantizer output, it is possible to break up undesirable signal-dependent patterns in the quantization error sequence without increasing the variance of the error. The effect of the dither noise becomes significant when the number of bits per sample is less than about six. An experimental evaluation of the perceptual effects of dither on speech has shown: (i) strong preferences for dithered speech over straight PCM encoding at identical bit rates, (ii) for low bit rates (2–4 bits/sample), a preference for dithered speech over PCM encoded speech even when the PCM speech had one more bit per sample than the dithered speech, (iii) an increase in word intelligibility for dithered speech over PCM speech when 4 to 6 bits/sample were used, (iv) a decrease in word intelligibility for dithered speech over PCM speech when 2 to 3 bits/sample were used."
"This is a study of the visibility of television noise and its dependence on the instantaneous rate of change of the video signal. Noise added to a picture tends to be least noticeable in regions where the brightness changes rapidly, but the relationship between visibility-of-noise and slope-of-the signal is dependent on the scene being displayed. Measurements are presented for four different scenes, and these data are used to design companding laws that minimize the visibility of noise from Differential Quantizers. The designs agree with those that have been satisfactory in practical applications."
"The buildup of dead jumpers in the Main Distributing Frame (MDF) plays a central role in MDF problems; for example, a recent survey ranked dead jumpers as the number two problem on a list of the most frequently reported MDF problems. In this paper, two models are proposed to quantify the buildup of both live and dead jumpers and to investigate the factors influencing the buildup. These models provide tools for the analysis and comparison of possible solutions to the buildup problem."
"The paper expands the basic concepts of the coding theorists in the representation of data strings by algebraic polynomials, and develops the representation of both time and location of individual binary positions in the same polynomial. Further, it advances a set of algebraic operations on such polynomials to correspond to the various subfunctions that are accomplished in the actual domain circuits. The specific applications of the techniques proposed in this paper for the design and synthesis of such circuits is presented in a companion paper."
"The principles of Multidimensional Polynomial Algebra developed in a companion paper1 are applied to two T-bar circuits with bubble-no-bubble coding and one double rail circuit with lateral displacement coding. The object of this paper is to indicate the flexibility of the algebra in its use with real circuits and to emphasize the potential of the algebra as a design tool for bubble circuits."
"XYTOLR is a computer program which checks integrated circuit mask designs for compliance with design rules such as those which require minimum clearances between diffused and metallized areas. The input is the same machine readable mask description that is used for automatic mask art work generation. Clearance violations, if present, are reported in graphic and printed form with pointers to the erroneous statements in the user's input."
"A computer program is described which generates every intersection figure resulting from the superposition of two closed polygon-like plane figures, each consisting of an arbitrary number of line segments or circular arc segments. Each intersection figure is assigned to one of four regions of the plane, representing the union, the intersection, and the two “exclusive-or's” formed by the pair of input figures. The two input figures may intersect or be tangent at any number of points and may have sections of coincident boundaries. No grid approximation is used. The program operates in two stages: the first stage analytically finds and classifies every point of intersection or tangency of the figures; the second stage regards these points as the nodes of a graph and applies an algorithm which causes each intersection figure to be traced just once."
"A computer simulation of two-dimensional mobile radio systems arranged with square coverage areas on a square grid and using dynamic channel assignment techniques is described. Parameters for the simulation are: (i) 729 distinct coverage areas (27 on a side), (ii) 160 radio channels and (iii) a radio channel reuse interval of every fourth coverage area. Three different channel assignment strategies are considered and the results are compared to previous one-dimensional simulated systems and to a fixed channel assignment system. At call blocking rates below about 10 percent, the two-dimensional dynamic channel assignment systems carry more traffic and produce fewer forced call terminations at coverage cell boundaries than do fixed channel assignment systems. For example, at a blocking rate of 1 percent, the traffic carried, TC, expressed in Erlangs per channel per coverage area by the various systems are as follows: fixed channel assignment systems, TC = 0.44, one-dimensional dynamic channel assignment system, TC = 0.62, two-dimensional dynamic channel assignment system, TC = 0.63."
 "The charge-coupled device, as described originally by Boyle and Smith,1 operates by moving minority carriers along the surface of a semiconductor with voltage pulses applied to metal electrodes which are separated from the semiconductor by an insulating layer. The transit from one electrode to the next is determined by the minority carrier transport under the influence of their own potential, fringing fields, and diffusion, and by the trapping properties of interface states. The transport limitations are largely determined by device geometry;2 for 10-μm electrodes, thermal diffusion is predominantly responsible for transferring the last small amounts of charge forward and limits efficient operation to clock frequencies below 10 MHz. Surface state trapping is much less dispersive, and even at low frequencies 1011 states/cm2 eV can impose the requirement for regeneration after as few as 100 transfers.3,4 In order to circumvent these problems, Boyle and Smith5 have proposed a modified CCD structure in which the charges do not flow at the semiconductor surface; instead they are confined to a channel which lies beneath the surface. This buried channel device has the potential of eliminating surface state trapping. (Bulk trapping should be several orders of magnitude less important as a CCD loss mechanism.) Calculations show that this modification will give rise to increased fringing fields under the CCD electrodes. Diffusion is replaced as an important factor in the intrinsic transfer process by the more powerful field-aided transfer. This leads to fast, efficient transport even when very little charge remains to be transferred. In addition to these advantages, the higher mobility found in the bulk of the semiconductor should further enhance the speed of the device.2"
"It is appropriate, on this fiftieth anniversary of the founding of BSTJ, to recall the genesis and purpose of the publication, as set forth in the Foreword to Vol. 1, No. 1, of July 1922 (see opposite page)."
"This paper describes a possible sort of data network for the transmission of addressed blocks of data between data terminals. The network consists of a number of closed rings or loops around which data blocks circulate. Data terminals on local loops can read data into empty blocks and read data addressed to them from full blocks. Buffered devices transfer data between local and regional loops and between regional loops and a national loop. Loops so interconnected need not be synchronized; they need not even operate at the same bit rate. Provisions are made for a “busy” signal, for special loops to carry heavy traffic between particular local loops, and for alternate routing."
"In a companion paper, J. R. Pierce has described a novel data communication network which makes use of a hierarchy of interconnected rings or loops. The basic elements necessary to realize this network are called “A,” “B,” and “C” stations. Data blocks are circulated on closed loops formed by the interconnection of “A” and “B” stations. The “B” stations provide user access to the network while one “A” station on each loop performs supervisory functions. Isolated loops are interconnected by “C” stations. This paper describes an experimental hardware implementation of specific “A” and “B” station designs which operate via a T1 carrier system loop. A hog prevention technique is incorporated into the system which prevents any group of stations from monopolizing a loop. A likely “C” station realization and loop transferring algorithm is outlined. A bypass box which would automatically remove malfunctioning stations from the loop is also described."
"Two laboratory computers have been interconnected through an addressed-block data transmission system (ring) as described by J. R. Pierce and implemented by W. J. Kropfl. This paper gives an idea of the equipment, programming, and protocols of communication through that system."
"In this paper it is shown how standard linear programming techniques can be applied to designing finite impulse response digital filters. Attention is concentrated on designing filters having exactly linear phase, and arbitrary magnitude response. The design method is illustrated by examples of the design of frequency sampling filters with constraints on in-band ripple, optimal filters where the passband and stopband cutoff frequencies may be specified exactly, and filters with simultaneous constraints on the time response and frequency response."
"Using coupled power equations to describe the average performance of a multimode waveguide with random coupling, it is shown that a Gaussian input pulse remains approximately Gaussian with a pulse width that increases proportionally to the square root of the length of the waveguide. The proportionality factor is determined for the model of a slab waveguide. Since coupling between guided modes of necessity causes coupling of some of the guided modes to radiation modes, radiation losses are un-avoidable. A desired improvement in pulse distortion that is accomplished by coupling the guided modes intentionally to each other must be paid for by a certain loss penalty. This loss penalty is also evaluated for the special case of the slab waveguide model. Pulse dispersion improvement can be achieved by providing intentional roughness of the core-cladding interface of the dielectric waveguide. The “power spectrum” of the core-cladding interface function must be designed very carefully in order to minimize the radiation loss penalty that accompanies any attempt to reduce pulse dispersion. The dependence of the loss penalty on the shape of the “power spectrum” of the core-cladding interface function is studied in this paper. Design criteria for the improvement of multimode pulse dispersion are given based on the slab waveguide model. The connection between the slab waveguide model and the round optical fiber is pointed out."
"A model of voiced-sound generation is derived in which the detailed acoustic behavior of the human vocal cords and the vocal tract is computed. The vocal cords are approximated by a self-oscillating source composed of two stiffness-coupled masses. The vocal tract is represented as a bilateral transmission line. One-dimensional Bernoulli flow through the vocal cords and plane-wave propagation in the tract are used to establish acoustic factors dominant in the generation of voiced speech. A difference-equation description of the continuous system is derived, and the cord-tract system is programmed for interactive study on a DDP-516 computer. Sampled waveforms are calculated for: acoustic volume velocity through the cord opening (glottis); glottal area; and mouth-output sound pressure. Functional relations between fundamental voice frequency, subglottal (lung) pressure, cord tension, glottal area, and duty ratio of cord vibration are also determined. Results show that the two-mass model duplicates principal features of cord behavior in the human. The variation of fundamental frequency with subglottal pressure is found to be 2 to 3 Hz/cm H2O, and is essentially independent of vowel configuration in the programmed tract. Acoustic interaction between tract eigenfrequencies and glottal volume flow is strong. Phase difference in motion of the cord edges is in the range of 0 to 60 degrees, and control of cord tension leads to behavior analogous to chest/falsetto conditions in the human. Phonation-neutral, or rest area of cord opening, is shown to be a critical factor in establishing self-oscillation. Finally, the complete synthesis system suggests an efficient, physiological description of the speech signal, namely, in terms of subglottal pressure, cord tension, rest area of cord opening, and vocal-tract shape."
"A special class of transmission lines is considered, in which the modes decompose into two noninteracting sets. Both a single transmission line with constant characteristic impedance and variable propagation factor, and two transmission lines with equal propagation factors and variable coupling, in which the forward modes do not interact with the backward modes, are investigated. Exact expressions are obtained for the reflection and transmission coefficients when a section of such a transmission system connects two semi-infinite transmission systems consisting of constant impedance and admittance lines. These results hold for arbitrarily varying propagation factors and coupling; and while they are of independent interest in the case of deterministic variations, we make an application of them here in the case of stochastic variations. Exact results are obtained for the ensemble averages of the transmission coefficient and transmitted power, and their variances, for the inserted section of single line, when the variable propagation factor is a random function involving either a Gaussian process or the random telegraph process. Asymptotic results are also obtained in the general case of weak fluctuations and long inserted sections. Analogous results may be obtained for the inserted section of two lines when they are randomly coupled, and the results are given in the case of matched lines, for which no reflections occur. Finally, some of the time domain statistics for lossless lines are considered, and expressions are derived for the ensemble averages of the transmitted pulse, due to pulses incident on the inserted section."
"By adding a pseudo-random “dither” noise to a signal X that is to be quantized, and by subtracting an identical noise sequence from the quantizer output, it is possible to break up undesirable signal-dependent patterns in the quantization error sequence, without increasing the variance of the error E. The idea has been widely discussed in the context of picture coding, and it is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate application of the technique to the quantization of speech signals. Computer simulations have shown how the use of dither whitens the quantization error sequence in PCM encoding, and renders it more acceptable than signal-correlated errors of equal variance. We demonstrate, for conditions of dither and no dither, typical speech recordings, illustrative error waveforms, and data on signal-to-error correlation C, and indicate how the advantage of dithering increases monotonically with crudeness of signal quantization and becomes significant when the number of bits per sample is less than about six. While the parameter C is a simple criterion for demonstrating the effect of dither, it must be emphasized that the truly relevant criterion is the statistical independence of E and X, and not merely the decorrelation of these functions. Thus, for example, we show that for the case of a reciprocal PDF (probability density function) for X, a zero value of C can be achieved without dither. For purposes of implementation, it is desirable to employ dither noise values characterized by a discrete PDF, with a support that is equal to an integral multiple of the step-size Δx in the quantizer. We show that for effective dithering, the step-size ΔN in the noise PDF need be no smaller, typically, than Δx/4. Finally, we indicate an application of dither to the quantization of speech signals by delta modulation."
"In a queueing system with two independent input streams, as exists, for example, when first-routed and overflow traffic streams are offered to a common sender-group, the state of the system encountered by the two different types of customers upon their arrival will generally be different. Consequently, in a system where delayed customers wait for service, the service rendered to the individual streams may also be different. The delay distribution in a single-server queue for each type of customer is derived under the assumption that one stream is Poissonian and the other is described by a renewal process. The difference in service received by the two streams is examined with the aid of numerical examples for two interarrival time distributions of the renewal stream. We show for two cases that a practical indicator of service received by the renewal customers is the coefficient of variation of their interarrival time distribution. If the coefficient is less than unity, then the renewal customers receive better service than the Poissonian customers. The converse is true when the coefficient exceeds unity. The stationary distribution of the number of busy servers in an infinite-server system as seen by the two types of customers is also derived."
"Two methods are described for the optimal equalization of a channel with “Bump” Equalizers composed of several adjustable-gain Bode Networks. The first method is a general one and applies a steepest descent algorithm which minimizes the total mean-squared error (MSE) of the equalized channel. It requires continuous gradient information on the error-gain relationship in order to determine exactly the optimum equalizer adjustments and involves a relatively complicated procedure to calculate the gradient. However, the second method, which also applies a steepest descent algorithm, develops the necessary gradient information with knowledge of the error signal only at selected frequencies across the bandwidth occupied by the channel. Under idealized assumptions, it is shown that the gradients obtained by the second method are exact. When the assumptions do not apply exactly, it is shown by computer simulation that the difference between the gradients obtained by the two methods is very small. A significant potential advantage of the second method lies in the hardware realization which only requires the measurement of the channel error at 2M — 1 frequencies at the equalizing station (where M is the number of Bode Networks in the equalizer). From these frequency domain errors, the gradients can be generated as real-time signals and applied to the appropriate adjustable elements to obtain the optimum gain settings for minimum MSE."
"We study the dimensionality for the class of near-end crosstalk functions in a cable. The dimensionality is closely related to the distribution of eigenvalues for a particular integral operator that we call the energy operator. We find bounds for these eigenvalues in terms of the eigenvalues associated with the prolate spheroidal waveforms studied by Landau, Pollak, and Slepian. The important technical observation, permitting us to use their results, is that though the crosstalk functions are not band-limited, the degree to which they are band-concentrated can be uniformly specified."
"A communication system for multiple-address messages is described, in which a message waits in parallel queues until it can be transmitted simultaneously to all the addressed receivers. An idealized mathematical model of this system leads to a nonlinear integral equation for the stationary distribution of delays in receiver queues. A phase-plane analysis shows this equation to have a one-parameter family of solutions, one member of which is found to be the unique limiting distribution of receiver delays. Even though service times (message lengths) are not bounded, the receiver queues in this model can operate in the steady state at critical load. Under these conditions, the probability that a server is idle is positive; and all moments of the delay distribution are finite. Computation of the delay distribution is discussed, numerical examples are given, and the behavior of the transmitter queues is analyzed. Predictions of this model are compared with performance parameters of simulated systems. The model is shown to be very accurate up to its critical load. For higher loads, performance depends strongly upon the number of receivers in the system. The model's discontinuity in receiver occupancy is not physically realizable, but is approached asymptotically as the number of receivers tends to infinity."
 "Cylindrical magnetic domains (bubbles) are, by now, well known. Their device applications1 and theoretical description2 have been adequately described. We shall call these bubbles “normal” (NB). In this B.S.T.J. Brief we wish to describe a new type of cylindrical domain that can coexist in many of the materials that support NB's. They were first observed by R. F. Fischer and R. H. Morrow of Bell Laboratories while testing a Y-Bar shift register using a platelet cut from bulk GdTblG. These domains, which we shall call “hard” bubbles (HB), have properties that can be substantially different from NB's."
"A conventional magnetic bubble material consists of a magnetic garnet film deposited on a nonmagnetic substrate. Garnet films with stress- and/or growth-induced uniaxial anisotropy are deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) usually on Gd3Ga5O12 substrates. In this B.S.T.J. Brief we report on the properties of multilayer garnet films deposited by LPE."
"Hard bubbles are cylindrical magnetic domains which differ from normal bubbles in their static and dynamic properties.1–3 They form and collapse at fields considerably higher than normal bubble domains (hence the name “hard bubbles”) and, under the action of a gradient in the perpendicularly directed magnetic field, they have a component of motion either to the right or to the left rather than straight down the gradient (right- and left-handed hard bubbles). Under the influence of a small alternating field superimposed on the dc bias field, normal bubbles oscillate in size or strip out in a random manner, whereas hard bubbles tend to strip out in an S-shape and rotate in either a counterclockwise direction for the normal S-shape or clockwise for the reverse S-shape. It has been found that high-speed propagation using permalloy overlay circuits is impossible in materials which are prone to hard bubble formation."
"A new class of magnetic bubbles designated as hard (and intermediate) bubbles has been found to be a common feature in many bubble garnet films.1 These hard bubbles have been very disruptive to the operation of bubble circuits since they not only have a much lower mobility than normal bubbles, but also tend to move at an angle rather than parallel to the direction of the driving field gradient. Fortunately, it has recently been found that the presence of a second magnetic layer apparently eliminates these hard bubbles.2,3 This second layer can either be a growth layer with a sufficiently small moment so that its magnetization under a bias field is always oppositely directed to the magnetization within the bubble,2 or it can be a layer with magnetization perpendicular to the bubble magnetization. This latter layer might be produced by ion implantation to the point where a stress-induced uniaxial anisotropy in the plane of the film overcomes the previously existing anisotropy.3 We propose in this B.S.T.J. Brief that the apparent elimination of these hard bubbles is due to the presence of the domain wall between the bubble and this second layer."
"This is the first of a series of articles describing the D2 Channel Bank-from initial conception, system design, circuit development, physical design, through manufacture, installation and service. Our objective is to provide a complete story of how one product progressed from identification of need through various phases leading from early planning to operating company application. In this introductory article, the motivation for undertaking the development is pointed out, and the reasons for the choice of the various system parameters are discussed. The D1 Channel Bank, which was designed for exchange application, was the pioneer in digital channel banks. As a second generation channel bank developed for toll application, D2 could be expected to show significant advances over its predecessor. Of the many possible improvements, some would result in incompatibilities with portions of the existing plant. In such cases, engineering judgements were necessary to determine which of these were warranted by the performance improvements they allowed. This article documents the historical evolution of the D2 Channel Bank system parameters."
"Traditionally, the design of switching machines has assumed that the transmission plant consists of physical wire pairs. Therefore, appropriate interface equipment is necessary when a multiplex transmission system is substituted for wire pairs. This interface, or per-channel, equipment performs such functions as (i) 2-wire to 4-wire conversion to separate the two directions of transmission, (ii) detection of signaling and supervision information, and (iii) band-limiting and level compensation of the signal prior to sampling. Since failures of the multiplex system can cause massive service interruptions and tie up switching equipment, provision is made to detect such failures and alert the switching machine. Design of per-channel equipment is complicated by the number of options required to account for the large variety of ways in which switching machines utilize wire-pair plant. This article describes the per-channel equipment of the D2 Channel Bank and some of the considerations that went into its design."
"Analog multiplexing and coding in the D2 Channel Bank is discussed in this article. Multiplexing of the message signals is accomplished in two stages. In the first stage, groups of 12 channels are multiplexed together using resonant transfer gates. The resulting eight buses,' each carrying pulse-amplitude-modulated signals of 12 channels, are then multiplexed in the second stage. The samples of all 96 channels are presented to a single coder. The demultiplexing plan follows the inverse of the multiplexing plan. The output of the decoder is first divided into eight buses, and the final demultiplexing is accomplished in groups of 12 channels. Because the decoding is accomplished by an asynchronous time-shared decoder, storing and stretching of the analog samples is necessary to permit removal of the time jitter due to the queuing process. The coder used in D2 is a nonlinear coder using a compression characteristic called the 15-segment approximation to the µ = 255 law. To ensure the success of the coder development, a stage-by-stage binary coding plan was chosen. The first stage determines the polarity of the signal, and the succeeding binary stages determine the amplitude of the compressed signal one digit at a time. To achieve accuracy in the coder with available devices, automatic zero-setting circuits are used in a feedback loop to control offset deviations. This is in addition to the use of precision resistors and precision power supplies for the remaining critical parts of the coder. In order to achieve comparable accuracy in the decoder, the same stage-by-stage arrangement is also used. Again, automatic zero-set feedback loops are used to control drifts. The performance of the coder/ decoder combination has met the objectives."
"This article describes the generation of timing signals and processing of digital information in the D2 Channel Bank. The transmitting portion of the D2 Channel Bank, which has four digital outputs, operates under the control of a single synchronous timing circuit. Because the four digital inputs to the receiving section of the D2 Bank are generally asynchronous, independent timing circuits are used for each of the four inputs. In addition, a separate clock is used in the receiver section to operate a single decoder shared by the four digital inputs. Digital processing of the transmitting terminal includes the serializing of the coder output, inserting of signaling and framing information, and converting the binary code into a bipolar format for transmission over the T1 digital line. To perform the inverse operation just mentioned, the receiving portion of the D2 Bank must extract timing information from the received digital signal and recover the framing information so that the decoded PCM words can be properly demultiplexed. In addition, queuing logic must be performed to permit sharing a single decoder among four asynchronous inputs."
"The D2 Channel Bank requires a variety of voltage sources to operate. Some have lenient regulation requirements, while a few have extremely tight tolerance requirements. To derive these voltage sources from a 48-volt central office supply with a minimum of complexity and good conversion efficiency, a tailored design is chosen where, for the less critical voltages, a single switching regulator is used to supply a dc-to-dc converter with several dc voltage outputs and, for the critical voltage sources, series-type regulators are used."
"The D2 Channel Bank is designed to provide simplified engineering, installation, and maintenance. Integral voice-frequency alarm and access are provided in a packaged shop-wired frame with a centralized built-in test capability to facilitate initial line-up, testing, and trouble shooting. Circuits are implemented with discrete components and with thin-film and silicon-integrated circuits. Low cost, reliable assembly and wiring techniques are employed. The frame organization and circuit partitioning provide a functional arrangement of circuits with good electrical isolation between critical multiplexing and coding functions. An introductory program and an on-going reliability program have demonstrated the adequacy of both equipment and documentation. In the first 21 months of operation, approximately 3 percent of the circuit packs shipped have failed in initial line-up or in-service. This compares favorably with the performance of similar systems, and recent design modifications are expected to result in substantial improvements."
"Previous articles in this issue have covered the design concepts of the D2 Channel Bank. This article is about the contribution by Western Electric, the manufacturing and supply organization for the Bell System. The discussions will focus on the effort at Western Electric, Merrimack Valley Works which includes bay and circuit pack manufacturing. Although certain portions of these topics are rather routine to those in manufacturing, they will be briefly mentioned in order to give completeness in explaining how a new product line is put into production. This article thus serves to give the reader a better understanding of how a product is introduced by telling, in narrative form, the D2 Channel Bank story."
"Loss, coupling, and delay differences among the modes of multimode fibers influence their transmission characteristic in a complicated way. An approximation of the modes by a continuum leads to a comprehensive description of these interrelations. We relate the mode power distribution to the far-field output and calculate these distributions as functions of the fiber length and the input. We report measurements of the far-field distributions at various lengths of a cladded low-loss multimode fiber. A comparison of theory and experiment yields a quantitative estimate of the mode coupling involved. We associate this coupling with random irregularities of the fiber configuration and straightness, and construct a quantitative model of such irregularities."
"The results of an earlier paper, describing pulse propagation in multimode dielectric waveguides with random coupling, are specialized to the two-mode case. Because of their greater simplicity, the results for this special case provide more insight into the mechanism of pulse shortening due to mode coupling. The two-mode theory yields a formula for the width of a pulse carried by coupled guided modes that is found to hold also for four modes, so that it may be true for an arbitrary number of modes. This formula [eq. (23)] contains only the measurable distance required to establish the steady-state power distribution and the length of uncoupled pulses. The pulse length formula is identical with Personick's important result. Our treatment suggests that the characteristic length appearing in this formula may be accessible to measurement."
"Using perturbation theory, an expression for the variance of the power of each mode of a multimode waveguide with randomly-coupled modes is derived. The variance builds up from zero to a constant value as a function of z (length along the waveguide). For most cases of interest, the variance is equal to the square of the average power. This means that the power of each mode of a system of randomly-coupled modes of a multimode waveguide fluctuates like the short-term time averaged power of a narrowband electrical signal the voltage of which is a random variable with Gaussian probability distribution."
"This paper discusses the scattering losses of dielectric slab waveguides that are caused by higher-order grating lobes of the sinusoidally distorted core-cladding interface. The results of this paper are used in a companion paper to evaluate the radiation losses of multimode guides with intentional mode coupling. An exact system of equations is derived for the amplitudes of all grating orders. This system is used to derive first- and second-order approximations that hold for small amplitudes of the sinusoidal interface distortion. The theory is used to derive formulas for the average power loss coefficient for first- and second-order scattering processes."
"Pulse spreading caused by the different group velocities of the guided modes of a multimode waveguide can be reduced by providing intentional coupling between the modes. Coupling among the guided modes inevitably leads to radiation losses. This loss penalty is discussed for two types of loss processes. We consider that the highest-order mode loses power by second-order coupling to the continuous spectrum of radiation modes. We also consider a loss process that is caused by nonresonant coupling of guided modes to lossy neighboring modes. Both loss processes can cause a substantial loss penalty. However, the loss penalty can always be reduced by limiting the intentional coupling to fewer of the guided modes, allowing the highest-order modes to die out. The discussion is based on a slab waveguide model."
"A linear phase modulator is a useful component in a short-hop radio system using digital modulation. Such a modulator has been designed, built, and tested for 4-level operation at a carrier frequency of 300 MHz and for a line rate of 20 megabits. In this paper, the design and the performance of the modulator are presented. Measurements on the phase modulator show that the performance is in agreement with the theory."
"The successful operation of an n-channel two-phase charge-coupled device has been achieved. The asymmetry in the surface potential profile necessary to force the charge to move unidirectionally was obtained by ion implanting a nonuniform doping distribution in the Si substrate under each gate. An eight-stage shift register with a length per stage of 80 µm was made, and was operated as both a digital and an analog device. There are two ways to clock the device. Either both clock lines are driven with square waves, out of phase by one half of a period, or one clock is held at a fixed DC potential while the other is driven with a square wave. Using the latter method, the charge transfer efficiency was better than 99.9 percent per transfer over the clock frequency range of 103 Hz to 6.5 × 106 Hz."
"We analyze a proposed scheme of detection of phase-shift-keyed signals using an injection-locked oscillator the bandwidth of which is much less than the modulation rate. The output of the oscillator is a carrier with essentially all of its modulation removed. We analyze the effect of noise and signal modulation on the phase of this reference tone and compute its effect on the probability of detection error. If a suitable encoder and decoder are used for the transmitted signal, this technique can provide nearly ideal coherent demodulation."
"We examine a data-rate synchronization system capable of operating in two modes: (i) in master-to-slave mode when the data stations are connected by digital transmission facilities, and (ii) in slave-to-slave mode when the data stations are connected by analog transmission facilities. The first part of this paper determines the steady-state behavior and the transient response in the master-to-slave mode. The results show that the system is well behaved in the transient stage, and that the steady-state behavior is satisfactory. From the transient analysis, the buffer size requirements of the system and the counter size requirements of the rate-locked loops are determined. Formulas are developed from which the start-up time of the system can be estimated. The second part of this paper examines the behavior of the system in the slave-to-slave mode. It is shown that the data stations can settle to the same steady-state signaling rate, and this signaling rate is determined. The dependence of this signaling rate on other system parameters is examined. It is shown that the system can be easily designed such that the steady-state signaling rate will lie within desired limits. (This is so regardless of the starting sequence, the initial system conditions, and time delays in the communication channels.)"
 "Multidimensional Polynomial Algebra1 is a new technique for the analysis of circuits in which a finite and distinct time interval is necessary for the propagation of binary bits of data from one location to the next. These conditions exist specifically in magnetic domain circuits.2,3 The algebra expands the basic concepts of the coding theorists,4,5 and includes the representation of both time and space in the algebraic representation of data streams. A set of algebraic transformations1 has been developed to correspond to the subfunctions in the circuit, and the overall function is thus modeled by a series of algebraic transformations. Such an analysis predicts the location and the value of all the binary positions at any prcchosen instant of time, thus leading to the algebraic verification of the operation of a proposed circuit. In the foregoing technique for analysis, one velocity of propagation was assumed. However, the circuit designer may depend on more than one velocity for the successful operation of the circuit, and the technique suggested here accounts for different propagation velocities. Further, the analysis proposed determines the relationships between such velocities."
"An intense spot of light projected onto the photo-sensitive surface of an imaging device can cause this device to saturate locally. Excess carriers generated by the light source can diffuse into the neighboring area which may also be driven into saturation. In the display the light source will then appear as a white area that can be considerably larger than its image in the true geometrical proportions. This effect, known as blooming, is present in most TV camera tubes, and demands special care by the operator to avoid bright objects in the scene being imaged. For the Picturephone® camera, which often has to operate in less than ideal conditions, the design of a camera with limited blooming is thus more than desirable."
"In the operation of data transmission systems over voice-grade telephone channels, phase jitter1 is a commonly observed transmission impairment. It appears in the form of low-index angle modulation of the received data signals. It is believed that phase jitter is a very important parameter in determining system performance. Therefore, many complicated methods2,3 have been developed to recover the jittered carrier. However, recent field measurements1 show that the phase jitter in Bell System carrier systems has improved significantly over the past few years. As a result of this improvement, the following question naturally arises: How much phase jitter recovery is required for two-level and four-level systems?"
"Signals at 4, 6, and 11 GHz, transmitted over a 28.5-mile radio relay path in Ohio, were continuously monitored during the late summer of 1966. Previous publications have reported on the observed 4- and 6-GHz multipath fading statistics, and on the improvements available with space or frequency diversity. This paper presents data for the 11-GHz transmission, and, in combination with the earlier results, establishes an empirical frequency dependence for the amplitude statistics. A general treatment of the relationships between the factors underlying multipath propagation is intractable. However, based on the results in this and other papers, a general relationship is given for the probability of deep multipath fading which is linear in frequency, cubic in path length, and varies with meteorological-geographical factors. Temporal aspects of the Ohio data were also investigated at all frequencies, utilizing both a 1-hour and a 1-day clock time interval. It was found that the multipath fade time statistic can be described by a single parameter for either interval. A subset of the multipath fading hours was also analyzed using a 1-minute clock interval, with the result that the difference between the minute median fade and the hourly median fade is frequency independent, and normally distributed with a standard deviation of 5.5 dB."
"This paper discusses the performance and interface advantages of a self-isolating bipolar-IGFET (BIGFET) integrated structure as an output buffer-driver for IGFET integrated circuits. The low-capacitance, high-impedance input and low-impedance, high-current output characteristics make the BIGFET ideally suited to drive large output capacitances and to interface with bipolar logic circuits. It is shown that in a shift register application the operating speed is increased substantially when the BIGFET is used as output buffer and is essentially independent of output capacitance up to 100 pF. The application of BIGFET output circuits to 5-volt T2 L and 3-volt collector-diffusion-isolation (CDI) T2 L is also discussed."
"Given a directed graph G, algorithms are discussed for finding (i) all paths through G with prescribed originating and terminating nodes, (ii) a subset of these paths containing all the edges, (iii) a subset containing all the edge-edge transitions, and (iv) a subset containing the most likely paths."
"Tape-recorded, spoken wiring instructions eliminate the need for a wireman to divert his eyes and hands from the equipment he is fabricating. A computer technique is described for automatically converting printed wire lists to synthetic speech. The technique was used to synthesize spoken wire lists for crossbar-4 equipment, and the result was tested informally on a production line at the Western Electric Company plant in Oklahoma City. No errors were made in wiring crossbar-4 circuitry from the computer-synthesized instructions."
"How well can a computer identify a human face which is described by a person who is inspecting a photograph? We give an account of an interactive system that takes advantage both of the human's superiority in detecting and describing noteworthy features and of the machine's superiority in making decisions based on accurate knowledge of population statistics of stored face-features. Experiments using a population of 255 faces and 10 or fewer feature-descriptions showed that the population containing the described individual could be narrowed down to less than 4 percent in 99 percent of all trials."
"Guided modes of multimode waveguides exchange power if the waveguide deviates in any way from its perfect geometry. The power exchange problem is studied for a multimode slab waveguide under the assumption that the power coupling is caused by irregularities of the core-cladding interfaces. The problem is treated by means of coupled power equations. The main result of this study is the realization that the power distribution versus mode number settles down to a steady state distribution if the waveguide is sufficiently long. The shape of the steady state distribution depends on the correlation length of the function describing the core-cladding interface irregularities. For very short correlation length only the lowest-order mode carries an appreciable amount of power while the power carried by all the other modes is orders of magnitude smaller. For very long correlation length, on the other hand, all guided modes carry equal amounts of power. The steady state distribution is achieved regardless of the way in which the power was distributed over all the modes at the beginning of the guide. However, the total power in the steady state mode distribution is dependent on the initial power distribution."
"The integral charge-control model for bipolar transistors is rederived with the purpose of elucidating hot carrier effects. In its original derivation the model contained an additive hot carrier contribution to the base charge of possible significance in narrow-base transistors. Inclusion of this term is shown to be unnecessary. However, careful examination of the potentials appearing in the formalism has disclosed other hot carrier effects. These could lower the transconductance of a transistor operating in or near saturation, particularly if the base has a low number of impurities per unit area, but would otherwise be unobservable."
"This paper explores the possibilities of accomplishing the functional requirements of encoders and single-error correcting decoders for cyclic block codes using the inherent properties of magnetic domains. Typical designs and embodiments of such encoders and decoders are presented with field access propagations for moving the magnetic domains."
"The delay distortion in glass fiber optical waveguides due to small elliptical deformations of the cross section is calculated. Simple approximations are given for the case of small differences in index of refraction between core and cladding (weak guidance). Since the delay distortion is quadratically dependent on the index difference it is found that it is generally possible to keep it negligible by judiciously choosing the guide parameters."
"This paper describes an exceptionally simple scheme for binary partial response signal formats of the form ak ± ak-1 (for l ≧ 1, and ak = ±1). The receiver implements the maximum likelihood detector of the sequence ak assuming additive white Gaussian noise as the channel impairment. It is simpler and more efficient than the scheme recently described by G. D. Forney.1 It is, however, not generalizable to multilevel signaling while still retaining its simplicity."
"This paper presents a unified treatment of linear time-variable networks displaying arbitrary geometrical symmetries by incorporating group theory into an analysis scheme. Symmetric networks have their elements arranged so that certain permutations of the network edges result in a configuration which is identical with the original. These permutations lead to a group of monomial matrices which are shown to commute with the network A-matrix and the state transition matrix of the normal form equation. The representation theory of groups facilitates the study of those network properties which are determined solely by symmetry. By using group theory, a simple arithmetic condition is derived which, when satisfied, implies that the network is noncontrollable or nonobservable because of symmetry alone. The results allow the determination by inspection of linear combinations of the original state variables which result in noncontrollable variables. It is shown that networks displaying axial point group symmetry are generally only weakly controllable."
"One of the electromechanical transducer candidates for the electronic telephone is a bilamellar piezoelectric ceramic.∗ In order to meet the design template for transducer response in the acoustic band, 0.3 kHz–3.0 kHz, a controlled resonant condition must be introduced at the upper end of the spectrum. An analytical program, consisting of three complementary parts, was carried out in order to understand the phenomenology of the transducer/support system response to acoustic loading. The three parts are: (i) a simple direct variational model, used to generate parametric design information; (ii) an exact solution with a lumped mechanical model of the support structure, used to evaluate the effect of using different rubber materials in relation to the design goal; and (iii) a finite element modal survey of the system, used to determine the necessary design modifications and to expose deficiencies in the previous models."
 "Recent progress in reducing the losses in optical fibers1 has increased the possibility that such fibers might be used as dielectric waveguides in future optical communication systems.2 The loss properties of such fibers are therefore of interest. This note concerns the measured change in transmission loss of a glass fiber for an ambient temperature variation of −196°C to +200°C. The results indicate that the loss in glass fibers varies only slightly with temperature."
"In an interlaced scan television system, the vertical sampling rate of an image can be halved by sampling every other field. Picture elements in the missing fields are replaced in the display by both temporal and vertical interpolation, but the resulting pictures show some visible defects. This paper describes how these defects can be eliminated at the extra cost of fully sampling in selected areas of the picture. For a typical Picturephone® scene with active movement the selected areas make up about 6 percent of the picture elements in the unsampled field. The technique can be combined with a wide variety of interframe-coding techniques. In one particular example in which the television signal is specified as clusters of frame-to-frame differences, the cost of specifying “active” frames (14,000 significant frame differences per frame) is reduced from 68,000 bits to 42,500 bits. This corresponds to a reduction in bit rate from 2 Mbits sec−1 to 1.3 Mbits sec−1."
"In recent years a number of nonlinear codes have been discovered which have better error-correcting capabilities than any known linear codes. However, very little is known about the properties of such codes. In this paper we study the most basic property, the weight enumerator. The weight of a codeword is the number of its nonzero components; the weight enumerator gives the number of codewords of each weight, and is fundamental for obtaining the error probability when the code is used for error-correction on a noisy channel. In 1963 one of us showed that the weight enumerator of a linear code is related in a simple way to that of the dual code (Jessie MacWilliams, “A Theorem on the Distribution of Weights in a Systematic Code,” Bell System Technical Journal, 42, No. 1 (January 1963), pp. 79–94). In the present paper, which is a sequel, we show that the same relationship holds for the weight enumerator of a nonlinear code. Furthermore, a definition is given for the dual α⊥ of a nonlinear binary code α which satisfies (α⊥)⊥ = α provided α contains the zero codeword."
"The discrete-time model of delta modulation is considered for a stationary random input process with a rational spectral density, and an auto-covariance that goes to zero as the lag approaches infinity. For leaky integration, the joint distribution of input and decoded approximation processes is shown to approach a unique stationary distribution from any initial condition. Under the stationary distribution, the decoded process may take on all values in a bounded interval that is independent of the input process. For the often-studied ideal integration model of delta modulation, it is shown that the successive distributions at even parity time instants converge to a limiting stationary distribution, while at odd parity time instants the distributions converge to a different limiting distribution. Under these limiting distributions, the decoded process is assigned a positive probability for each level of a (discrete) lattice of amplitudes. The mean-absolute approximation error and mean-absolute amplitude of the decoded process are shown to be finite under the limiting distributions. For both ideal and leaky integration cases, an explicit upper bound on mean-absolute approximation error is given, which is independent of the spectral density of the input process."
"An efficient computer algorithm is described for the perspective drawing of a wide class of surfaces. The class includes surfaces corresponding to single-valued, continuous functions which are defined over rectangular domains. The algorithm automatically computes and eliminates “hidden lines.” The number of computations in the algorithm grows linearly with the number of sample points on the surface to be drawn. An analysis of the algorithm is presented, and extensions to certain multi-valued functions are indicated. The algorithm is implemented and tested on two different computers: a large central computer with hard-copy capability, and a small laboratory computer affording interactive use. Running times are found to be exceedingly efficient on both machines. Interactive implementation of the algorithm, with on-line scope display and view-point control, enables effective and rapid examination of a surface from many perspectives."
"The effects of quantization (i.e., roundoff, truncation, etc.) and adder overflow, which are present in any special-purpose computer type realization of a digital filter, cause an otherwise linear system to become quite nonlinear. Moreover, the presence of such nonlinearities can cause the system's response to differ drastically from the ideal response (that is, from the response of the linear model of the filter) even when the level of the filter's input signal is, in a certain reasonable sense, small, and when the quantization effects are made arbitrarily small. In this paper we derive a criterion for the satisfactory behavior of second-order digital filters in the presence of such nonlinear effects. The criterion is shown to be sharp, in that we also present a procedure for constructing counterexamples which show that, for most filters which violate the criterion, the response to some “small” nonzero input signal is not always even asymptotically close to the ideal response."
"One-dimensional transistors are well-understood today; computer techniques for detailed large-signal and small-signal analyses are available. Real transistors are three-dimensional, however, and lateral effects are only understood qualitatively. Accurate modeling of lateral effects cannot be accomplished without quantitative analyses of three-dimensional transistors. Unfortunately, even the simplest analysis of lateral effects leads to a partial differential equation. In this paper, a fast and accurate numerical technique is used to solve the partial differential equation. This makes feasible a three-dimensional small-signal analysis of transistors operating in the low-injection regime. Calculated h-parameters for a high-frequency, double-diffused, silicon transistor are in good agreement with experimental values."
"This paper is based on results derived during a stability study of the Saturn V rocket for which it was necessary to validate the use of Nyquist's encirclement-counting technique in distributed systems. An outline of the paper is as follows: Certain results concerning the finiteness of the number of zeros of polynomials in s and es are shown in Theorem 1 and its corollaries. Theorem 2 is a generalization of Michailov's Criterion. Simplifying assumptions, usually valid in practice, yield a simplified test to determine if “encirclement-counting” is a valid stability test [equation (20)]. The results are reformulated for an open-loop analysis. Various aspects of the theory are shown by three examples based on an electrical equivalent of a simple single-engine, liquid-fuel rocket."
"The stochastic process appearing at the output of a digital encoder is investigated. Based upon the statistics of the code being employed, a systematic procedure is developed by means of which the average power spectral density of the process can be determined. The method is readily programmed on the digital computer, facilitating the calculation of the spectral densities for large numbers of codes. As an example of its use, the procedure is applied in the case of a specific multi-alphabet, multi-level code."
"This study reports data on the statistics of instantaneous speech levels in continuous speech samples, with special emphasis on threshold crossings and other quantities related to peak clipping. All clipping thresholds for each speech sample are defined with respect to the individual speech level for that sample, specified in equivalent peak level (epl). Speech clipping is also treated as speech-correlated noise by assuming that it is caused not by a voltage limiting process, as actually occurs, but by an additive “phantom signal” that will cause the original signal to appear to be clipped. Empirical measures are obtained for the percent time a clipping level is exceeded, for the relation between phantom signal (i.e., noise) power and clipping level, and for the loss in signal power resulting from clipping. The relation is also established between epl and average (rms) power to allow signal power and signal-to-clipping noise levels to be specified."

"The development of power semiconductor switching devices near the turn of the last half century opened new avenues in electrical engineering. The potential impact of this addition to technology attracted a certain attention in its initial phases. Lasting effects that would be of significance to the electric technology as a whole, were developing only slowly and were sparse in number. The electrical power engineers who tried to use these new devices would soon be faced with often perplexing problems, which all but discouraged further work."
"The theme of the first technical session was methods of analysis as applied to a variety of electronic power processing systems. The seven papers, all of which could be classified as research papers, presented new concepts and ideas relating to the analysis, design and management, of power by electronic means and provided a theoretical basis upon which many of the circuits and systems presented in subsequent sessions could be examined and interpreted."
"Averaging techniques are developed here to represent buck, boost, and buck-boost types of switched dc-dc converters by approximate continuous models. Simple analytical expressions in terms of the circuit components are derived for the characteristic transient and frequency responses of timeaveraged (continuous) power-stage models for use in designing and understanding the behavior of corresponding switched power stages. Novel conclusions include the dependence of effective circuit component values upon switch duty ratio and the existence of a real positive zero in certain transfer functions. Responses from analog computer simulations of the switched and averaged power stages agree well and, in turn, confirm the analytic predictions. High-order systems can be analyzed by the averaging technique without a commensurate increase in complexity."
"An analysis is presented for the transfer functions of a particular pulse-width modulator and power switch subsystem that has been widely used in practical switching-mode d-c regulator systems. The switch and filter are in a \"buck\" configuration, and the switch is driven by a constant- frequency variable duty-ratio push-pull magnetic modulator employing square-loop cores. The two transfer functions considered are that with modulator control signal as input and that with line voltage as input. For a-c signals, the corresponding describing functions (DF) are derived. It is shown that current-source drive to the modulator extends the control DF frequency response over that with voltage drive, and that complete cancellation of the effects of line variations can be obtained at d-c but not for a-c. Experimental confirmation of the analytical results for the control DF are presented."
"One of the earliest-developed and still widely-used dc to square-wave inverters is the Royeror Uchrin-Taylor configuration shown in Fig. 1. Although the circuit is composed of very few components, its proper operation depends on complex interactions of the transformer as it switches between its unsaturated and saturated regions, and the tow transistors as they switch between cut-off and saturation. Numerous qualitative descriptions of the operation of this circuit have been presented; however, the complexities introduced by the multiple nonlinearities are such that few mathematically based analyses have been presented, and these have been rather limited in scope (1,2,3,4). The analysis presented in this paper provides insight not only into steady-state operation but also into the transient behavior of the circuit. It also makes evident the influence of certain small, often neglected, parasitic elements such as winding capacitance, transformer saturation inductance, and semiconductor junction capacitances."
"A P.W.M. power system unit is presented for a modular regulated bus concept. This power system is composed of 4 shunt sections and 2×20 AH, Ag-Cd batteries, with independent charger and discharger functions. All these regulators operate under P.W.M. control at 100 KHz sampling frequency and phase shifted synchronisation for minimising ripple and filtering. The sequence of the operation is the following, from eclipse to sunlight. The regulation is first controlled by the boost dischargers and automatically transferred without logics to the regulating bus battery chargers. The shunts operate when the capacity of the batteries is fully satisfied. Charge control of the battery and limitation characteristic of the bus voltage are automatically performed by imposing a pulse width limitation in the P.W.M. control of the charger and discharger functions, without any external sensor. Every regulator is studied separately, then the description of the complete power system is presented and some performances in static and dynamic mode are given."
"The power handling portion of most regulated dc-to-dc electronic power conditioning circuits using a single self inductor for energy storage and transfer can usually be represented by one of three basic or canonical circuit forms. (1) The circuit elements, consisting of an inductor, a transistor switch, a diode, and a filter capacitor may be arranged with appropriate topology to yield a voltage step-up converter, a current step-up converter, or a voltage step-up/current step-up converter. The design of a power converter requires making a number of decisions relating to the parameters of the circuit, including choice of semiconductor elements, filter capacitor, magnetic core material, magnetic path configuration and winding wire size. In the past, converter designs generally have required that several trial combinations of core size and permeability be tested by hand calculations. Experience and intuition were relied on to narrow the range of core size and permeability before starting the trial design computations. Recently, several computer-aided procedures have been described for use in the design of the inductor for a single type of converter (2, 3) This paper presents the results of the development of a series of nine programs which may be used to design the inductor in each of three basic converter forms in which the transistor switch is controlled by a regulator employing a constant frequency, constant on-time, or constant off-time pulse-width modulator. These nine programs, which contain the design algorithms and evaluation segments, are augmented by three additional programs which generate displays on a storage oscilloscope driven by the computer. These displays have proved to be extremely useful in evaluating the characteristics of the various converter-regulator combinations from an overall or global point of view."
"The transient and steady state performance of a group-triggered cycloconverter supplying a controlled slip induction motor is studied using an analog computer. System equations are derived from equivalent circuits for the cycloconverter, source, and motor networks. The induction motor is represented in terms of qdo components in a stationary reference frame. Computer results are compared with test data on a laboratory system for both motoring and dynamic braking modes of operation. Commutation failures in the power circuit are illustrated and discussed. Good agreement between computer output and laboratory tests suggests the method of analysis can be used for optimizing circuit design and improving overall system operation."
"Summary form only given. A new era in power processing began with the development of power transistors and silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs) more than a decade ago. Advanced functional circuit designs based on a wide range of device ratings and characteristics will undoubtedly have major impact on present and future applications. The authors of the papers presented in this session are recognized contributors in the power processing field. The paper by Mr. C. J. Marlett deals with the analysis of a \"push-pull\" type modulator to power a 50 kw pulsed xenon arc lamp. In Mr. E. Reimer's paper, a new solid state switch concept, identified as the Integrated Hybrid Transistor Switch, is introduced. In the paper, \"Analog Signal to Discrete Time Interval Converter,\" by Mr. V.R. Lalli and Mr. A.D. Schonfeld, the IADTIC is conceived, designed, and developed for the purpose of standardizing future power processor control circuitry. The important subject of soft commutation of high power SCR inverters is dealt with briefly by Mr. R.F. Kantz. Three more papers are on the subject of power processing involving batteries. The paper by Mr. H. L. Layte and Mr. D.W. Zerbel deals with the protection circuitry of a nickelcadmiurn battery cell from overcharge or discharge in long lifetime applications. Mr. F. Benjamin's paper explains the reflex principle of charging nickel-cadmium and other batteries. Effects on the various operating parameters are explained in the last paper by Mr. J.T. Lingle and Mr. W. Dudley. Their paper is a study to determine the optimum power processing circuitry between a remote battery or fuel cell source and sensors and communication devices. Progress is expected in providing a broader range of devices for future inverters and converters for higher voltages over a wider range of current ratings. Continued research and development of power processing circuitry should result in profitable new products for many commercial, industrial and defense applications."
"A new modulation technique has advanced the state of the art in pulsed high power short arc xenon flashlamps. The design of a 50 kW pulsed average power xenon arc lamp was predicated on the development of a push-pull type of modulator to enable heat to be equally extracted from both electrodes. Normally, arc lamps are pulsed from a dc source resulting in high anode temperatures and consequent deterioration. On the other hand, the lamp cathode is less of a problem due to the benefit of electron cooling. Hence, a modulator designed to operate in a push-pull fashion allows the heat load on the lamp electrodes to be balanced. The advantages to be realized include a lower total thermal load on the anode and two paths (both electrodes) for heat injection. The modulator design is presented along with preliminary test results on developmental 50 kW average power lamps which have been pulsed to 100 kW average pulse power on a 50 percent duty cycle."
"USAMERDCs development efforts have been directed toward compact and efficient power supplies in order to cut the weight and bulk of power conditioning equipment presently used. In this effort, weight reduction has been achieved at the cost of considerable equipment complexity and possible difficulties concerning field serviceability by semi-skilled personnel. This complexity is mainly due to the restrictions imposed upon the designer by the performance capabilities of the currently available solid state power switches. To overcome these restrictions, this Center developed a new solid state switch concept, commonly referred to as the Integrated Hybrid Transistor Switch or IHTS. (1) The IHTS is a high performance switch of the transistor family except that the device is internally protected from the most common equipment failure modes. This simplifies the construction of formerly complex equipment functions. In the foreseeable future, precision power conditioners may eventually contain only interchangeable IHTS modules. Component reductions makes practical many power conditioner equipment applications heretofore considered economically not feasible. The universal utility of the IHTS to equipment design and the device's contribution to the simplicity of equipment construction detail gives rise to the expectation that the component is attractive for usage in commercial applications with a consequent reduction of cost. It is against this background that the paper describes the IHTS and some of the newly provided alternatives to the Army in the area of high KVA/lb/Dollar power conditioners."
"The application of analog signal to discrete interval converter (ASDTIC), a hybrid micromodule, two loop control subsystem, to a switching, stepdown dc to dc converter is described in this paper. The power circuitry, interface and ASDTIC subsystems used in this switching regulator were developed to exhibit the improved regulation, transient performance, regulator stability and freedom from the effects of variations in parts characteristics due to environmental changes and aging. ASDTIC can be used with other types of power circuits that use duty-cycle control techniques by simple changes in the interface subsystem-1-. The circuitry and performance characteristics of a +10V dc switching converter as well as that of the ASDTIC micromodule are described. Realization of the ASDTIC hybrid micromodule has been accomplished with a hermetically sealed, beam-lead, bonded/deposited nichrome thin film resistors, discrete capacitors and integrated circuits on dilithic, glazed alumina substrates using 22 feed through terminals in an integrated package."
"In the process of developing a high power inverter utilizing S.C.R.'s in high voltage D.C. bridges, it became apparent that the commutator circuit would determine the inverter size and weight. Therefore, we developed a single co mutator circuit that was capable of commutating multiple bridges. Using similar reasoning we felt that the commutator should be as conservative of power as possible. These trends led us to a commutator that assumes the inverter load of the main bridge S.C.R. and returns the energy to the commutating capacitors. The losses in the circuit are restricted to I2R and switching losses only. The commutator consists of a single L-C network and appropriate steering S.C.R.'s. The losses are kept to a minimum by designing a high Q resonate circuit."
"Protection of battery cells from overcharge and from over-discharge is an important criteria for the successful operation of battery cells over long lifetimes. Battery level charge control based on cell level parameters also improves battery operation. Circuitry to perform both of these functions has been developed by TRW Systems under contract with the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Aero Propulsion Laboratory on the 2 KW Long Life Battery Program, Air Force Contract No. F33615-70-C-1627 and on several earlier programs."
"The reFLEX principle is a new battery charging technique. This paper explains how it works, why it is superior to other battery charging methods and what effect various parameters have on its operation. It provides results of Government and commercial tests, evaluations and daily use. It reports on the present status of reFLEX charging with various types of batteries."
"The objective of this investigation is to determine the best means of processing the power from remotely placed batteries or fuel cells to power sensors and communication devices having very light, steady state loads and much heavier short duration pulse loads. This paper discusses the requirements, interface characteristics, and problem areas associated with various approaches and illustrates the most favorable approach, push-pull converter-pulse width modulation, and the results obtained."
"The design and testing of Transcalent Solid State Power Devices are described. In a Transcalent Device the active element is made an integral part of two heat pipes. Thus the mechanical and thermal barriers between the silicon and the heat rejection surfaces are eliminated. Discussed will be the operational characteristics of the Transcalent Devices and, briefly, the design and fabrication of a 400 - ampere RMS Transcalent Thyristor, 250 - ampere Rectifier and design objectives of a high power transistor."
"The paper deals with the novel aspects of a newly developed transient voltage suppressor. Details of its operation, fabrication and characterization are given. Its performance is compared against the more familiar devices currently used for transient voltage protection including devices such as spark gaps, zeners and selenium suppressors. Application features are discussed briefly. Future development trends and their significance to the system designer are given."
"The self-healing fuse is a very fast acting current overload protective device which opens and recloses in a few milliseconds. The fuse confines a mercury column in an insulated channel and returns the mercury to the channel after firing. Ratings 5 to 50 amperes at 600 peak volts are possible with a life of hundreds of cycles. Compared to conventional fuses, much less fault current energy fires the fuse by heating the mercury to boiling temperature. Next an arc discharge develops while explosive forces expel the liquid mercury from the channel. Then the high impedance arc either extinguishes immediately, or operates for a few milliseconds, until a switch opens the circuit. Containing this explosion and arc demands a reinforced, very refractory insulator as a fuse channel. Several channel materials and geometries have been tried. Preferred are sapphire and beryllia as materials and several cylindrical holes in parallel as a geometry."
"This paper describes the design and development of 1500 volt, 1000 amp rms, 4 kHz triode thyristors and companion rectifiers for high frequency power conditioning. In order to obtain devices with the objective specifications, programs were conducted on selection of emitter profiles and geometries, on lifetime evaluation and control, on encapsulation development, and on interdigitation optimization of the thyristor cathode and gate. Spreading velocity measurements of the on-region of the thyristors and use of a rating model which was computerized established the interdigitation required to obtain the objective current rating at 4 kHz. An auxilliary built-in amplifying thyristor was used to provide high gate drive to the highly interdigitated cathode emitter of the thyristor. Uniformity of turn-on was determined by observations of infrared radiation during turn-on and determinations of the spreading of the on plasma."
"A new generation of planar high voltage, high current transistors has evolved which makes use of new high current density techniques. The resulting transistors have already been made with Collector to Base breakdown voltages of over 1500 volts and Collector to Emitter sustaining (base terminal open circuit) voltages of over 1000 volts. The high current density techniques have permitted current capabilities of 60 amperes, combined with sustaining voltages over 400volts on a single chip transistor."
"Summary form only given. The technical papers for this session are concerned with a variety of power electronics applications. These papers are involved with several areas of application and include power systems for ground application, power distribution, and control for aircraft and aerospace vehicles, and electric propulsion control for ground vehicles. One paper is concerned with the application of the uninterruptible power system (UPS). Two papers are concerned with power electronics applications in aircraft, and aerospace vehicles. It is shown that for large space vehicles which rely on static energy conversion to provide electric power, high voltage DC distribution is preferrable to conventional distribution techniques. This technique can offer advantages in weight, reliability, design flexibility, and cost The two other papers are concerned with power electronics applications in the electric propulsion control of ground vehicles."
"This paper presents a new concept in electrical power distribution systems for air craft and compares the conventional approach to this concept. The historical development of this concept is presented and system application as developed by the Air Force and Navy laboratories is discussed. Some of the capabilities of an electrical system using this concept are presented. Electrical distribution systems perform four basic functions. These are: (a) to gather control data information, (b) to determine from this data the proper control action, (c) to transmit this control information to the location of the control action, and (d) to perform the necessary control action. The electrical distribution system must do the above four items in a safe and orderly manner which will not result in fire or other unsafe conditions if a short circuit or any other malfunction occurs. Thus, i t must also provide circuit protection and failsafe operation."
"During the past ten years the Army has invested a sizable effort into new systems configurations and development programs to improve ground vehicle mobility. USAMERDC, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, has been particularly interested in an improved vehicle mobility for off-highway vehicles, amphibians and engineer equipment through electrical propulsion. Because electrical propulsion drive systems feature individual wheel controls, the supply logistic and construction of such vehicles can be justified in terms of an improved mobility over all types of terrain. Past experience in industry and in the Government has shown that the dc motor propulsion drive is inherently simple to install and to maintain. The dc motor is somewhat heavier than comparable ac motors due to motor speed limitations; however, the dc machine, particularly the series field motor, requires only a simple solid state power processor since the power is processed by the motor's own commutator. Commercial dc traction motors have an excellent high torque starting characteristic which is mandatory for engineer type vehicle propulsion applications. In the mid-speed range, however, presently available dc motor propulsion drives under consideration for the Army have an unsatisfactory acceleration performance when compared to conventional mechanical drive systems which typically comprise a spark or compression ignition engine and a multispeed transmission. In this context the paper discusses this Center s experimental solid state controller and the method employed to improve the acceleration or peak power propulsion profile of an electric vehicle drive using dc series field motors. A power processor for shunt field motors is also described, also able to provide identical propulsion characteristics through storage of kinetic energy in a high speed flywheel."
"Primary power source dropouts can cause voltage transients or loss of conditioned power to critical or essential electric power-using equipment. Some of the power loads require controlled transient power, that is , conditioned power which at all times is contained within specified voltage regulation limits. Critical loads which can tolerate a temporary loss of power can be satisfied by the availability of a standby power source. Essential loads which require controlled transient power supply voltage must include in the system configuration of the uninterrupted power supply, an active energy storage element. There are three basic ways in which the controlled transient uninterrupted DC power supply can be configured. The special features of the three systems are compared and the most suitable application for each system is indicated. To illustrate the reduction to practice of one of the controlled transient uninterrupted power supply configurations, a 3KW uninterrupted DC power supply developed for the U. S. Army ECOM by TRW Systems is described indetail."
"The results of a current NASA study program to develop a rational basis for selection of power processing, distribution and control configurations for future aerospace vehicles including the Space Station, Space Shuttle, and high performance aircraft are presented. Within the constraints imposed by the characteristics of power generation subsystems and the load utilization equipment requirements, the power processing, distribution and control subsystem can be optimized by selection of the proper distribution voltage, frequency, and overload/fault protection method. It will be shown that for large space vehicles which rely on static energy conversion to provide electric power, high voltage dc distribution (above 100 Vdc) is preferable to conventional 28 Vdc and 115 Vac distribution per MILSTD- 704A. High voltage dc also has advantages over conventional constant frequency ac systems in many aircraft applications due to the elimination of speed control, wave shaping, and synchronization equipment. These conclusions are based on detailed design analyses of power processing equipment, switchgear, and cables as a function of voltage, frequency, power level, and control method."
"This work discusses the application of power conditioning to high speed ground transportation vehicles propelled by linear induction motors. The vehicle electric power and propulsion system and characteristics of selected vehicles currently under development by the u.S. Department of Transportation are discussed. A Brief review of the linear induction motor is presented. Several classes of power conditioners 3 capable of controlling power to the linear induction motor, are described. These power conditioners include both those which provide variable voltage fixed frequency power control and variable frequency, constant volts per hertz power control."
   "Maison de Radio-Canada, in Montreal, has been constructed to consolidate four television services and nine radio services of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. into one broadcast center. The center is located on a 25-acre (10.1-hectare) site. It contains 25 radio studios of varying size and seven color TV studios with two more built in shell for possible future use. Facilities include TV master control, presentation studios, telecine, kinerecording, videotape recording, film processing, dubbing, screening and viewing facilities."
"The transfer characteristics of telecine chains must be standardized if the quality of television pictures derived from film is to be improved. The level on which to standardize the light transfer characteristics of telecine for optimum results has been established. Experiments have shown that the overall television system should have an average gradient of 1.50.* Measurements on live camera chains confirm this finding. Upon applying measurements of film system transfer characteristics, we concluded that the telecine should have a gamma of 0.40, except at the black end of the curve where flare light in the telecine projector requires a higher gamma. Systems that have the optimum characteristics are in commercial use, but other systems in use have characteristics greatly different from the optimum."
"The new filmmaker is usually faced with many problems. Small budget, use of 16mm equipment, lack of time as well as an ability to choose the right film processing laboratory have led to many innovations during production — some old, some new. These techniques are discussed in reference to the production of a theatrical short."
"Recognizing that a motion-picture consists of a sequence of still frames and that it is presented at a speed of 24 frames per second only for the sake of the sound reproduction, it becomes apparent that a much more efficient system can be designed to record and display such information."
"A wiper-blade squeegee unit that spring-loads the blade edges against the film riding between the blades offers several advantages over the usual fixed mounting technique. The need for critical adjustment of the blades is reduced while constant and unvarying blade pressure on the film is provided. The spring-loaded squeegee yields the high efficiency of a precisely adjusted opposed fixed-blade squeegee while reducing the need for maintenance. A simple low-cost design using non-corroding plastic construction and fiberglass-epoxy springs is described."
            "British broadcasting celebrates its 50th Anniversary on November 14th 1972: the 50 years of BBC history has seen very great technological change. From the early medium-wave transmitters with primitive studio apparatus, through the introduction of sound-recording facilities, the opening of the 405-line television service in 1936 and the War years with their great impetus to overseas broadcasting, innovation has continued at an ever-increasing pace. Since the war, film kinescope recording of television, line-standards conversion, FM sound broadcasting, videotape recording, the change to 625-line standard, introduction of color, field-store standards conversion, use of “sound-in-syncs,” PCM stereo distribution and the use of negative color film direct on-air — these are some of the landmarks of technical progress. There still remains, however, plenty of scope for inventiveness on the part of broadcasting engineers."
"The authors discuss how to determine the video-circuit characteristics in order to improve picture sharpness of color TV sets. In particular, they tried to obtain such characteristics that would maintain good picture sharpness by preventing “blooming” phenomena, which the beam spot characteristics of the color picture tube would present at high beam current level. This paper concludes that it will be advantageous to reduce the shoot-height and widen the shoot-width in transient response of the video circuit, if attention is paid particularly to the sharpness at a high peak, which is an important factor of picture quality."
"New ultra-modern color mobile units designed and constructed by NBC and put into operation in 1966 were designed specifically for the expansion of NBC-TV's color programing, with emphasis on sports coverage. The primary units were three 40-ft trailers designated as the Equipment or Camera Trailer, the Control or Production Trailer and the Carryall Trailer. Technical operating facilities supplied with the three trailers consisted of five color cameras, a black-and-white insert camera, pulse-generating and distribution equipment, color videotape recorders capable of instant replay, a video-switching system accommodating 20 inputs, chroma key facilities and an audio system that accommodates 30 inputs."
"The design and construction of color television mobile units for the fast-growing field requirements take the engineer into many complex and diverse areas not usually encountered in studio design and construction. Gross vehicle weight, load distribution, tire loading and suspension systems become familiar terms. The requirements for heating and air-conditioning also differ from the conventional in many respects. In response to these requirements, four mobile units of three distinct types were developed and built by the engineering staff of WMAQ-TV in Chicago. One or a combination of these should meet the field needs of almost any television station or network."
"With the rise in demand for more on-location shooting of television shows, commercials and sporting events there came a need for a sophisticated mobile television production van. A van 40 ft (12.20 m) long and 8 ft (2.44 m) wide has been designed and built with the latest solid-state equipment. It features two VR-2000B videotape recorders; one HS-100 videodisc recorder; a 20-input, 11-output bus video switcher; a GO-input, 4-channel output audio console; ${1\\over 4}$-in (6.35 mm) audiotape recorder; two cartridge recorders; turntable; and six color cameras plus two monochrome cameras, one mounted on a film chain, and the other a portable unit used for graphics and insert keying."
"On the basis of information supplied to the press last July, and in relation to descriptions of other vans being published, we have been asked to describe briefly the numerous vans made and outfitted by RCA Corp., with emphasis on designs, and equipment different from the other vans described in this issue of the Journal."
"Because the high cost, large size and complexity of general purpose mobile TV units may not be justified, it may be more economic to design specialized units for three different applications identified as Live coverage, Drama inserts, and News coverage. The effect on the design of mobile units of lightweight cameras, camera cable and monitors is discussed."
"A mobile film-video system for producing 16mm film has been designed, utilizing six film/television cameras. The system features automatic control of camera motors, electronic exposure control, and encoded information for simple post-editing. The fundamental design goal was to utilize the production techniques of television while retaining the advantage of film as a final product."
           "Research has led to the development of a Semiconductor IMage Sensor (SCIMS) to replace the tube-type pickup devices currently used in television. Due to the need for scanning and focusing coils with pickup tubes, the ability to reduce the size and weight of television cameras is severely restricted. With the development of a totally solid-state camera these restrictions could be overcome. The development of SCIMS is described. Methods and techniques used for construction, reasons for using such methods and the results obtained are discussed. An evaluation of the results is given and areas where changes in techniques could effect improvements are pointed out."
"To achieve the minimum size consistent with full broadcast quality of picture, three full-size lead oxide vidicons are used and special techniques employed to improve the registration accuracy and tolerance of the three-tube camera to the inevitable minor variations in registration errors occurring during operation. By the employment of a novel optical system, the sensitivity has been raised well above that of existing cameras."
"The image isocon tube is described in detail and its features compared with those of other pickup tubes. The simplicity and reliability of the image isocon's target charge and discharge mechanism are explained. It is pointed out that modern circuit technology, coupled with new vacuum tube techniques, has made possible a camera-tube combination with minimal controls. Several illustrations of the capabilities of the isocon camera are given with some speculation as to its role in future low light level television applications."
"This report describes the design and construction of the National Bureau of Standards frequency-time broadcast station, WWV, located at Fort Collins, Colo. The principal function of the station, located 11.25 km (7 mi) north of Fort Collins, is to broadcast basic standards of frequency and time signals on frequencies of 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 MHz. These high-frequency transmissions, which can be received on the simplest of equipment, provide the necessary accuracy required to fill some of the needs of industry, Government and the public. The technical and administrative supervision of the station is under the Time and Frequency Division, Frequency-Time Broadcast Services Section, National Bureau of Standards, Boulder, CO 80302."
"The objective has been to produce a suitable transparency illuminator with almost perfect diffuse light, constant color temperature and minimum shading over a window area that will accommodate large-format television transparencies."
"Pollution control and recovery are both of primary importance to modern industry: pollution control, in order to save our environment and recovery to reduce industrial costs. The reverse osmosis system appears to fulfill both requirements ideally in the film laboratory. The recovery of water and heat, plus the reduction of effluent to more-easy-to-handle volumes has been accomplished. The methods by which this has been done and the analytical results of practical tests are discussed and evaluated."
"Expanded chemical facilities and control for a total of 70 solutions created a space problem at DeLuxe General Laboratories. A new systems approach, designed to make the most efficient use of existing space, was devised. A first step was the evaluation of processing solutions, leading to a consolidation program to eliminate duplication of chemical tanks. A continuing goal is the development of techniques to allow handling of more processes with greater control and a minimum amount of labor."
"At the present time, methods of film production with double-system sound synchronization using time-code identification on both the picture film and picture sound tape as well as the technical feasibility of such a system are being studied by many organizations engaged in television programing and equipment manufacture. In this paper an example of a complete crystal-controlled time-marking system, from film shooting to editing, is described."
           "The Ground Commanded Television Assembly, developed by the Astro-Electronics Division of RCA Corp. for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, represented a new level of performance for space application television equipment. During the Apollo 15 and 16 missions; a special camera provided the scientific community and the home viewer with real-time coverage of the lunar exploration. The lunar blast-off of the Apollo 16 ascent module was tracked by the mission controller at NASA's Manned Space Center and watched 250,000 miles away on earth. The operation of this television camera and the remote control unit arc described and block diagrams given. Ground-command capability from the Mission Control Center permitted versatility and optimization of the TV coverage, without diverting the astronauts from their primary role of lunar exploration. — The assembly consisted of a color TV camera, which utilized the now familiar field-sequential color wheel to generate color TV images, and a TV control unit. During operation on the lunar Rover, the color television camera video signal was routed through the television control unit where a vertical interval test signal was inserted. Next, the signal was supplied to the Lunar Communications Relay Unit where it was used to modulate a 10-W, S-band transmitter. The transmitter output was beamed to earth, received at one of the four earth sites and relayed to NASA's Manned Space Center at Houston, where the field-sequential format was converted to standard NTSC video and supplied to the TV pool for network transmission."
"The subjective effect of an echo in a television picture depends not only upon the amplitude of the echo but also upon its time displacement from the main signal. The relationship between amplitude and time displacement, in the form of an echo time weighting curve, has been used as the basis for designing oscilloscope graticules used in waveform testing methods. A series of subjective tests was performed to evaluate the effects of echoes on 525-line monochrome and NTSC color pictures. Observers used a seven-point comment scale, ranging from “not perceptible” to “extremely objectionable” to rate the echo impairments. The test results show that separate positive and negative echo time weighting curves are indicated for monochrome signals and that a third curve, applicable to both positive and negative echoes, is indicated for color signals."
"The Impairment Unit (imp) proposed by the British Post Office is examined in the light of the statistical models, either normal or binomial, used to represent observer opinion of television picture quality. For a single impairment, the interesting result is obtained that, given a binomial distribution of the mean opinion score, the logarithm of the imp is very nearly normally distributed. The imp concept is extended to multivariate distribution models representing opinion in the presence of more than one impairment. For two coexisting impairment, the imp sum, as a measure of the overall quality, is compared to the bivariate imp as above and is found to be a useful, if rough, estimate of the latter."
"While the television film preview room provides a critical condition for evaluation of films for color balance and tone reproduction, it is difficult to detect visually the presence of undesirably low densities in white areas. Presence of such “super-whites” can cause problems in television transmission. To remedy this deficiency of the optical preview room an inexpensive waveform monitor was assembled from a low-priced industrial monochrome television camera and a simple oscilloscope. The device is easily calibrated to indicate the presence of densities less than the recommended minimum of 0.30 for white objects. — This addition to the optical preview room should be useful to film laboratories in timing television prints, and to photographers and film producers in assessing the suitability of their films for telecasting."
"Three phenomena are described which can affect the quality of color films even though the film and process are on target. These are reciprocity failure, exposure plane temperature and solar altitude."
"Modern advances in magnetic recording and microphone technology are employed nowadays in the sound-recording process in film production. Original recordings often contain information up to 15 kHz. The final optical track commonly goes up to 9 or 10 kHz. Recorded sound quality is better than it appears to be when judged by listening tests in commercial theaters, due to the use of the Academy curve for playback. A technique based on “dynamic noise reduction circuitry” is described. The bandwidth of the standard optical soundtrack is extended up to 10 kHz in reproduction, without objectionable film noise. Also introduced is a dynamic high-frequency energy limiter. As an option, the monaural signal can be processed into a stereophonic signal pair, adding “depth effect.” In motion-picture-production use the channel available is expanded by an additional octave, providing better reproduction. There is no compatibility problem, and old prints can be reproduced with improved quality."
          "This Program is the scheduling of papers within the session. It is as accurate and complete as possible. Before the Conference, however, papers may be removed or rearranged into other sessions. The sessions arc firm. Questions about specific papers or sessions should be addressed to Society Headquarters, Att: Winter TV Conference — Denis A. Courtney, Executive Director, (914) 472–6606; Program Co-chairman James D. Caron, 1998 N.E. 150 St., North Miami, Florida, (305) 949–4252. The Final Program, listing titles of papers and Synopses, will be available ten days before the Conference from Society Headquarters."
   "Continual efforts are being made to improve the technical quality of color television pictures obtained from 16mm film. A very promising approach is to scan a color negative in the telecine instead of the usual positive print or reversal stock. This results in improved gradation, color fidelity, steadiness and resolution. There are problems of adequate film cleanliness and visibility of splices but these are receiving attention and the technique is in regular use by the BBC."
"Determining that modulator frequencies for helical-scan videotape recorders were at least close to manufacturer's specifications required the time-consuming use of a calibrated oscilloscope and frequency generator until the use of integrated circuits made it possible to design and construct a simple, inexpensive device to calibrate the modulator. Once installed in the recorder the calibrator may be utilized to check and adjust the modulator prior to recording. The result is less time spent in preparing recorders for use and reduction of the possibility of over-modulation. Additionally, the use of the modulator calibrator decreases color moiré, and sideband noise, increases frequency response and results in a reduction in differential gain and phase errors. The use of this calibrator requires only the monitoring of the video output of the recorder with any waveform monitor or even an uncalibrated service scope."
"A very high-gain screen for rear projection is described. The screen makes possible the use of low-wattage projectors to provide adequate intensity for color television production. The “hot-spot” which usually appears at the center of the background-projection screen has been eliminated, making it possible to achieve high-quality color reproduction. In manufacture, a large-scale Fresnel lens is cut into a sheet of acrylic plastic. Screens as large as 76 × 102 in (193 × 260 cm) are presently available."
"The three principal techniques employed to create composite images for television are briefly described. The use of the Lumiscope Fresnel lens rear-projection system is then discussed in some detail. When this system is used, projection of material by means of conventional low-cost equipment produces excellent results. There is no tendency to “hot spot,” and the effective gain may be up to six times as great as the practical maximum with conventional rear projection. The lighting of the set is conventional with Lumiscope, and the performer can see and react to the projected material. This paper details the applications experience in selecting the Lumiscope system gain level, and limits of camera movement with various overall gain levels. The even projection field and total absence of “hot spot” are demonstrated at equivalent projection power levels from approximately 175 to 500 W (incandescent). The system tradeoffs are analyzed and summarized."
"The requirements that determined equipment specifications and physical plant layout for a television station dedicated to an uncommonly large amount of locally-produced programing are set forth. Equipment selection, installation, and building preparation took nine months and within about fifteen months the station began commercial broadcasting. The large items of equipment include two Norelco 14-kW transmitters with solid-state low-power stages and IF modulation; an RF switching unit; an RCA 5-bay butterfly antenna; five PC-100 studio cameras; a PCP-90 portable video camera; three film islands, each with two 16mm projectors and a slide projector; four Ampex AVR-1 and two Ampex 1200 tape machines; one Ampex slow-motion recorder and one Ampex 4000 electronic editing equipment; and the production control room, master control room and tech-center consoles and racks. The RF switching complex permits eleven modes of operation between the dual transmitters and the 3/2 antenna. The Central Dynamics Ltd. master control switcher is planned for on-line, real-time computer control. Otherwise it appears to be a standard preset/take switcher. Later, a computer-controlled, station-automation system will be incorporated into the present switcher which will embody a number of interconnected, job-oriented programs."
"A scientific documentary* was shot on an expedition into a remote area in southern Mexico, an area containing caves — many of which house vampire and insect-eating bats. Bats were captured alive for studies at the University's laboratories. Planning for the filming of the expedition required considerable ingenuity. Procedures were established and some outstanding footage was obtained of insect-eating and vampire bats. Some unexpected sequences of wildlife were also obtained."
"The responsibilities of the SMPTE in the field of education basically relate to (1) the training of individuals; and (2) the production of hardware and software for use in education and training programs. Each of these quite different areas has many ramifications. The young person considering a career in one of the related industries asks what opportunities are there, what knowledge and experience are needed and where can he get it. The equipment manufacturers ask how their products can better serve education, and teachers are continually looking for better ways to present their subjects. Both groups recognize that acceptance of new developments hinges on standardization and they look to the SMPTE for leadership."
"The new educational technology which emerged in the 60s with the advent of computers, television, film, and other media failed to have a significant impact on learning. After analyzing the failure of educational technology during the past decade, the features and potential of videocassettes as a learning tool are explored to show how they can succeed where earlier hardware and software failed. However, teacher and student acceptance of cassette learning should not be taken for granted. Instead, outlined here are specific proposals making this teaching mode relevant to the present generation of media-oriented students and teachers. With these groups taking an active role in its development, cassettes are seen as leading the way toward creating a learning process which effectively combines information and technology."
"This paper outlines the information contained in a booklet published by Eastman Kodak Company entitled “A Survey of Motion Picture, Still Photography, and Graphic Arts Instruction.” The material for this publication was compiled by Dr. C. William Horrell of Southern Illinois University. Dr. Horrell surveyed appropriate schools regarding various areas including courses, staff and employment of graduates. He compared the responses with those received in a similar study he made in 1968. This comparison revealed a great increase in photography-related curriculum, while also showing that facilities and staff are not growing accordingly. From the latest survey, Dr. Horrell discovered that schools lose track of many graduates when they leave school. Of the ones who did report back, many have gone into some kind of photography-related work. However, many have also found that their college preparation has had little direct bearing upon their employment. Feeling that this situation could be alleviated by improved communication between colleges and industry, Dr. Horrell suggests establishing standards that would benefit students and industry alike. Students could then prepare for areas of employment wherein their skills can be properly utilized."
"A VISIT to the USSR in May of this year as an Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers delegate to the Popov Society provided the author with a third opportunity to observe progress in television and related fields over a span of 35 years. The purpose of the first visit, a ten-month stay during 1937 and 1938, was to help install RCA monochrome studio and transmitting equipment in a new television center in Moscow. The second tour of duty was in 1959 when a complete color television studio formed one of the most popular exhibits at the American Exposition in Moscow, as reported in the SMPTE Journal.1 This paper draws on experiences from all three visits to present an overall impression of the changes observed, particularly in the fields of television and motion pictures"
 "On July 21, 1972 SMPTE became the proud owner of the building, shown below, in Scarsdale, New York, in the heart of Westchester County. On or about September 15, 1972 the Society will move its headquarters to the new building, at 862 Scarsdale Avenue, Scarsdale, NY 10583."

          "The past year was a mixed bag."
"In general, a dropout may be defined as a momentary random signal reduction in the amplitude of the RF signal recovered from the tape."
            "It is time that we take an introspective view of our motion-picture and television technology, recognizing its weaknesses as well as its strengths. In our relationship with our “creative” people, we are like one part of a two-man team. Each must respect the other's input if the team is to function well."
"Our Society was privileged on May 1 to have at its Technical Conference as guest speaker Dr. Peter C. Goldmark. Dr. Goldmark's informal lecture, “It Is Later Than You Think,” was an adaptation of a lecture entitled “The New Rural Society” which he presented as a Poynter Fellow of Yale University where it was sponsored by the University's 1972 Seminars in Modern Journalism. The lecture, somewhat revised for printed presentation, appears on the following pages."
"I Welcome this opportunity to share with you my deepest concerns and also my hopes for the future."
"Some aspects of the Ampex Model ACR-25, an automatic cassette VTR using the broadcast 2-in quadruplex format and holding 24 cassettes in a circular carrousel, each with a capacity of up to 6 min of tape, are described. The carrousel is mounted between two vertical transports, and a cassette from any bin location can be selected and injected into either transport. While one transport is playing, another cassette can be located and automatically threaded into the other transport ready to take over. The switch occurs during a vertical interval, so there is no discontinuity of picture. An important feature of the machine is the ability to play spots of 10-s duration. In this 10 s, it is necessary to rewind the tape into the cassette, return it to the carrousel storage area, select a new cassette, and thread and cue before the previous tape has finished playing. Described in some detail are carrousel and tape-reel servos which are important factors in providing this rapid back-to-back operation. The servos described for cassette handling use only fundamental principles and require no routine adjustments. Loop gains can be held to within 3 dB."
"The largest and newest studio at the NHK Broadcasting Center intended for large-scale production is provided with the latest equipment. Remote-control lighting devices include monopole equipment suspended from lighting bridges and red-green-blue plus white additive equipment set in the cyclorama pit to make the studio appear deeper, to hide special-effects lighting devices and to permit color effects as desired. A large motor-driven camera crane with a reach up to five meters ($16 {1\\over2}$ ft) allows for a wide range of smooth camera work. The low-position dolly allows obtaining low angle shots with good control of the camera. Special effects can be obtained through specialized amplifiers. Color can be added to superimposed titles; color-phase change in the color-coder and variable-wave deflection (with any of five cameras) are possible. The audio mixing console is specially designed for TV broadcasting. There are 40 motor-driven microphone suspension mounts in the studio; small condenser microphones are used."
"Following an explanation of the fundamental differences between the recording of pictures and video signals, the paper describes the basic outlines of the much discussed methods of super-8 film, EVR, SelectaVision, magnetic tape and video discs, gives tables comparing their essential characteristics and operational properties and ends with some conclusions on these new and interesting developments."
"There is a great deal of widespread interest in “video cassettes,” or — more properly — in various systems for displaying program material over television systems, particularly over individual TV sets. For the producer, the laboratory manager, the educator, the business man and the consumer, the ability to display programs over televison presents some great opportunities, as well as some problems. — The advantages and limitations of the video displays are discussed, and some methods for overcoming the limitations are suggested. The role of super-8 film in the “video-cassette” field is explored, and concepts for applications are described. The concept of interchangeable software, for both video and optical projection, is discussed, and the ramifications of this concept for different applications are explored as part of a total systems approach to visual communications."
"Scanning of film for TV transmission is well established in the art for intermittent film advance. Various means of optical compensation for continuous film motion have been studied for application to television, but most of them have a degree of distortion which cannot be fully corrected and such systems are not acceptable for good quality pictures. — A means for electronic compensation has been worked out which permits greatly improved picture quality and, at the same time, permits a range of film speeds from zero to thirty frames per second and cooperates with the speed and uniformity of the particular sound recording and playback. A brief description of this system is given. It is noteworthy that controlled electronic compensation has advantages over optical compensation in this situation. The advantages of a continuous film system are outlined. A very brief description is also given of a new system designed in Germany which combines intermittent and moving film motion."
                "A method of making precision measurements of video-track rates or pitch relations on 2-in quadruplex recorded tape has been developed and has been used for several years. The proposed revision of ANSI Standard C98.6–1965 specifies for a tape, recorded at 15 in/s (38.1 cm/s), an average space between reference points on each fourth consecutive track of 0.062500 in (1.5875 mm) with a tolerance of ± 62 millionths of an inch (0.001575 mm) which amounts to a tolerance of very nearly ± 0.1 % of the track rate or pitch,* in an unstressed or relaxed condition. In attempting to make such measurements certain problems become immediately apparent: tracks made visible with carbonyl iron can be measured repeatedly to only about 0.001 in (0.0254 mm); and measurement of flexible tape to the accuracies specified is difficult if not impossible. A method has been devised to make the repeated measurements to within ± 0.01% of pitch by using a long piece of recorded tape and measuring the span occupied by a known number of tracks. The unstressed-condition dimensions are obtained from measurements at different known tensions and the results are extrapolated to the zero tension condition."
"A non-sprocketed tape recorder can be slaved to sprocketed film equipment, following in frame coincidence through repeated forward, stop, or reverse cycles. A pulse-counting technique has been developed to maintain synchronism, with the initial start made from visual cue marks on tape and film. The pulse source for the tape recorder is a control track, and for the film, a tachometer mechanically coupled to the distributor or projector."
"A two-inch cassette videotape format is described, including means of physically marking the useful span of tape. The proposed SMPTE time and control code is recorded on the cue track. In its user bits are encoded three groups of data for location of the message elements, automatic control of playback adjustments, and message identification."
"The Research Institute of Sound and Picture — VÚZORT — had the goal of developing a sensitometric method, giving measurement results applicable to manufacturing control of color film and its processing technology. For this, results must not be influenced by measuring instruments, especially the densitometer. Theoretically, the best way is to use equivalent neutral densities which give a maximum of information about the measured sample. But these densities cannot be measured easily and need very expensive equipment. The scientists of the Institute came to the conclusion that the best method of fulfilling established requirements must be based on monochromatic measurements, which are comparable to the ASA standard. Monochromatic wavelengths have been chosen according to the dyes and types of materials to be measured. They fulfill the condition that when a neutral gray sample is measured equal values for all three primary wavelengths are obtained. Theoretical analysis led to the establishment of a method called SENCOMET (Sensitometric Control Method). Measured values are transferred by means of nomograms, or tables, or directly by an analog computer, into the necessary correcting steps in the processing technology. The latest type of instrument developed is the Czechoslovak Automatic Recording Color Densitometer KBD II. It is being successfully used in research institutes, motion-picture film processing laboratories and photochemical plants."
"The basic concept of electrolysis and the principle reactions at the electrodes of silver recovery from fixing baths are presented. Some design considerations for a recovery cell and for the choice of an appropriate dc power supply are given. The voltage regulation and feedback controls are described and the requisite instrumentation used in their application stipulated."
"Subcommittees 60A and 6OR have been functioning for many years, however, the recent proliferation of audio/video equipment in the educational field prompted a suggestion by the Secretariat of TC 60 to form a separate subcommittee to deal with this subject. A rather detailed questionnaire on educational devices was formulated at the Oslo meeting* under an Ad Hoc committee chaired by the author. Subsequently, Raymond Wyman, University of Massachusetts, was appointed chairman for SC 60C and the new subcommittee became active this year."
"Note: Raymond Wyman was appointed Chairman of the newly created Subcommittee SC 60C for Educational and Training Equipment at the Meeting of the whole TC 60 Committee on March 21. The Secretariat for SC 60C is the Netherlands and the Secretary is W. Koeter. The following account of the first meeting of SC 60C has been prepared by Dr. Wyman as an informal and unofficial report."
"The Aim of this Work was to study the expansion of a gas breakdown plasma using our “home made” streak camera. Previous studies have used laser pulses less than 100 ns in duration. In our case the TEA (tetraethylammonium) CO2 laser generated appreciable amplitudes lasting several hundred nanoseconds; in this case a separate interaction process occurs during the laser pulse and a change in mechanism of expansion is observed. The laser was a helical geometric transverse excited CO2 laser 2 m by 2.5 cm pumped with a two-stage Marx-generator giving about 20 J in a 60-kV transient voltage pulse. The output is shown in Fig. 1."
"Metrication is a word now often heard, and usually referred to with disgust as one of these revolting foreign ideas that we gets foisted on us nowadays. — I hope to show that this is not so, and that except in a few cases the only merit of the units which we are now using is that we are familiar with them — or are we? Who can define a bushel? Or a peck?"
"The United Kingdom is changing to the metric system coincident with the adoption internationally of a rationalised system of metric units of measurement, the Système International d'Unités to be known by the abbreviation S.I. Units. — A programme of implementation has been laid down and much work has already been done. All new British Standards are being issued with metric sizes and in many industries and professions advisory panels are being set up to consider the implications and to assist in making the changeover meet the programme and to avoid the pitfalls before they occur."
                "Contrary to expectations, it was found that there was not a significant difference in the preferred color balance of prints selected from a large range of color balances viewed in a darkened room with tungsten (3600-K) projection or in a TV preview room (5400-K with lighted surround). All prints ranked good or excellent in the TV preview room were given a similar ranking in the theatrical projection room. The converse was not true — some prints accepted under the less critical darkened-room viewing were not acceptable under TV preview conditions. The same print density, also, is preferred under both viewing conditions. The conclusion is drawn that only one print balance, that selected under the more rigorous TV preview-room conditions, is needed for both theatrical and TV use."
"Precise centering of the several images of a color television camera is difficult to maintain for long periods. A digital system is described which detects and corrects the centering errors from the video signals of normal scenes. In this system the video is converted to short pulses representing high-level, sharp edges of objects and the horizontal centering errors are then detected by comparing these pulses for relative time differences. Vertical errors are detected by a similar system which operates from line to line on signals recreated from the pulses by line-strobing. These signals contain vertical errors only. High-quality integrating stores are used to extract the average corrective powers from the error signals. The dc voltages thus obtained are then used to modify the appropriate centering control voltages."
"The main design aim for a three-tube color camera was to produce a high-quality broadcast camera that requires the minimum of line-up time and that maintains its adjustments over long periods. Experience with a four-tube camera has greatly influenced the design and very many of its proven features have been retained. The camera is the unit most affected by redesign in order to achieve optimum performance from the three-tube configuration. Basically the same scanning and video plug-in printed circuits, adapted for three tubes, are used. The direct imaging prism type of light splitter includes an additional input for the bias light and internal diascope."
"The new Eastman 16mm Television Projector Model CT-500 has been designed for heavy-duty use with existing telecine systems and allows for compatability with foreseeable broadcast automation schemes. This professional-quality intermittent projector retains many of the design elements of its predecessors and incorporates the following new features: C-shaped threading channel with automatic gate-closing and loop-forming operations; high-speed slewing in forward or reverse; solid-state cuing system; and all control functions brought to individual terminal strips permitting remote control of any or all of the functions. Solid-state sound, halogen cycle projection lamp, reverse projection at 24 frames/s, automatic exciter-lamp changer, and control and readout of projection-lamp voltage are features that are new to Eastman projectors and are incorporated in the CT-500."
"The work of the Eastman Kodak Co. among television filmmakers and users has led to the conclusion that training is urgently needed to achieve the highly desirable goals of better and more efficient use of the film medium in television program production. In a series of five-day videofilm seminars at the new Riverwood Marketing Education Center near Rochester, participants are given the opportunity to become familiar with the way film is reproduced in the television system, and the consequences of improper operation on one side or the other, through practical “hands-on” experience with film cameras and telecine controls. In group evaluation sessions, the television pictures produced by each participant from films with density, contrast and color-variation extremes are subjected to criticism and discussion."
"Cue Analog is a system whose purpose is to eliminate notching, tape application, gratings and the handling of negative material during cuing. Foot and frame information is punched into the same tape containing additive light information and is read consecutively. A photoelectric transducer mounted on the printer feeds frame information to a counter. When the counter matches the punched tape, foot and frame data for a scene change, the system gates a signal to the additive light system for a modular or valve change. Also described is the bidirectional cue analog on a new panel printer, a unidirectional cue analog on a new panel printer, a unidirectional system on a new high-speed step-reduction printer and the programer for the new tapes."
"A footage and frame counting cuer has been developed to record where correction in exposure is to take place without marking the film itself. This record of feet and frames is punched into the cutomary eight-channel paper tape using existing tape punches. The cuer, which attaches easily to existing printers, takes advantage of the latest integrated circuitry technology. The unit includes its own tape reader. The record in the tape can be either the feet and frames from the start of the film (cumulative) or from the last correction (scene by scene). In the cumulative version it will handle up to 10,000 feet."
"Xenon compact are lamps are used increasingly instead of carbon arcs in motion-picture theater projectors and studio-lighting equipment. Such lamps have to perform with great reliability and must operate in horizontal position in order to be economic and efficient in up-to-date optical systems. The properties of four new-lamp types are described that meet these requirements. Three of these lamps are in the medium wattage range between 2000 and 4500 W and have conventional radiation-cooled electrodes. The fourth type can be operated reliably with inputs from 10 to 25 kW and has liquid-cooled electrodes. It should become useful for drive-in theater projectors and other equipment with great light-output requirements."
"The 110th SMPTE Technical Conference was a success in many respects and this included committee attendance. The Color session was again rewarding."
"The 110th SMPTE Technical Conference was a success in many respects and this included committee attendance. The Color session was again rewarding."
"The subject of narrow-tooth sprockets and the continued release of prints, primarily with wide perforations, was discussed at length. It was reported that about ten theaters had changed back to wide-tooth sprockets because there was nothing on the market but wide perforation film. This change was reported to have been spurred by an unusual amount of film damage. The discussion continued and it was requested that the Committee investigate the possibility of establishing the small perforation as the standard for release prints. The consensus of those present, however, was that such a proposed change could not be handled by the laboratories. While these facilities are able to manufacture some prints with narrow perforations, their ability or capacity to manufacture all release prints with perforations conforming to PH22.102 is currently impossible."
"The terms and definitions presented here were developed by the Nomenclature Subcommittee of the SMPTE Video Tape Recording Committee. The glossary sets forth the terms and definitions agreed to by the committee. Suggestions on additions, deletions and modifications should be sent to Alex E. Alden, Staff Engineer, Society Headquarters, as promptly as possible. The first group was published in the June 1970 issue of the Journal and the second in the May 1971 issue."
            "The Society's technical conference programs, its engineering activities and its publications are all oriented toward meeting the demands and potentialities of the times. This brief review introduces the special issue of the Journal for the Spring Technical Conference."
"What we Discussed at Montreal was called a new technology. Basically it involves a video-player, which may also be a video-recorder and which, when connected to the antenna terminals of a television monitor, or receiver, will reproduce, with sound, a prerecorded video program. The TV set is common to all systems which have been proposed. But the video-players of the various prospective systems involve not one, but several technologies. Thus, it would seem prudent that right at the beginning we define “technology” and make some basic observations about technologies in a socio-economic context."
"The use of artificial earth satellites to distribute television signals has commanded the attention of those interested in broadcasting ever since this application of space technology became a distinct possibility. The interest of SMPTE in this field is quite active as evidenced by the Symposium on Commercial Satellites during its Technical Conference in Los Angeles in April 19711 and by the seven papers on satellite transmission of TV signals presented at the 110th Technical Conference of the Society in Montreal (October 1971). Three of the papers, concerned with point-to-point distribution of television signals have been published.2–4 A further three papers were concerned with broadcasting television signals from a satellite; these are published immediately below."
"One of the factors that affect satellite broadcasting systems is the choice of modulation, whether it should be AM-VSB, as we have it in terrestrial broadcasting, or frequency modulation (FM). The latter is chosen for a theoretical satellite television system in the UHF-TV band based on the latest CCIR figures. From this the required field strength and satellite transmitter power are calculated. The required protection ratio is used to calculate the angular separation between satellites when using the same channel. An allocation of two and four channels to each of two satellites is used to determine the number of independent programs which could be made available in Canada, assuming the country is divided into four areas covered by two synchronous geostationary satellites. It is shown that four channels allocated to each of two adjacent satellites would provide a total of eight independent programs to the four areas without the necessity of having the satellites very widely separated, as might appear from preliminary observation. Finally, a practical example for Canadian coverage is presented."
"The standards problem involved in establishing a new television service by satellite is discussed. Three major possibilities are: (1) to match existing standards, (2) to match existing picture standards but allow new RF standards and (3) to allow new standards. It is concluded that matching existing picture standards with FM rather than AM modulation of the RF signal is the preferred approach for ETV and similar systems. Picture quality requirements should be set at the best of normal television, i.e., Grade 1. The relationships between carrier-to-noise, signal-to-noise ratio, deviation, threshold and fade margin, proposed channel widths and design values are reviewed."
"The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), in planning for its role in a domestic satellite system, must take into account the present service provided by AT&T as an absolute minimum requirement and also the anticipated opportunities for more extensive services that might be available. Any such expectation of increased services must be carefully analyzed with regard to cost. After briefly stating the requirements of a domestic satellite system for PBS and related organizations, some significant cost reduction techniques are discussed and finally there is presented the plan of an example satellite system meeting the operational requirements and incorporating the cost reduction techniques."
"The introduction of computers into broadcast operations raises problems of specialization and unfamiliarity with techniques for both the TV systems designer and ultimate user on the one hand, and the manufacturer and supplier of equipment on the other. The following three papers show how one specialist manufacturer utilized a computer consultant to obtain expertise to satisfy a customer's particular requirements. The problems and solutions are shown in turn from the points of view of consultant, manufacturer and user."
"Recently the automation of broadcast operations using small computers has attracted a good deal of interest in the television industry. A number of systems have either been installed or are in the planning and development stages. New users of computers often are not prepared for the typical problems that arise in implementing and using a computer automation system. Guidelines are given for planning, designing, implementing and using computer systems for broadcast automation based on experience with two computer broadcast automation systems, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Moncton and Vancouver Systems."
"Attempts are made to investigate the picture rendering of equal light-sensitive surfaces, such as a TV Plumbicon camera tube and a photographic film. Some factors which play a principal role in this comparison are discussed and results are then applied to the combination of film and telecinema. This study is restricted to two factors only: speed (sensitivity) and signal-to-noise ratio."
"High-speed framing photography has been employed to study the dynamic response of squirrel monkeys subjected to rapid acceleration in a vehicle. The primary purpose of the investigation was to perform a histopathological study to determine if any injury to the vestibular (part of the inner ear concerned with balance) and central nervous systems (brain and spinal cord of neck) results during whiplash. Consequently, 26 monkeys were exposed to accelerations in the range of 15 to 23 g's, and the motion of the head and neck structure was recorded. This paper presents high-speed photographic data obtained from a typical test run which permitted an estimate of the linear and angular accelerations to be made during whiplash. Based on a three degree of freedom model of the head-neck structure, the forces and stiffness parameters associated with resistance to the whiplash motion were computed from Lagrangian equations of motion."
"The engineers at Carter Equipment and RAMtronics started in the spring of 1969 the development of a photometric system for motion-picture laboratory printer control. This system, which is capable of measuring photometric values of continuous as well as of step printers, is described here. Additive and/or subtractive systems can be evaluated."
 "Ontario Place is a permanent steel and glass structure rising on steel stilts from the main lagoon amid a number of manmade islands off-shore in Lake Ontario. It is opposite the Canadian National Exhibition grounds of which it is an extension. It consists of five square “pods” and an experimental theater called Cinesphere. Each pod is 88 ft (26.82 m) long, 88 ft (26.82 m) wide and 32 ft (9.75 m) high. Cinesphere is six stories high. Its diameter is 110 ft (33.53 m) and it seats 800 persons in comfortable seats placed on a stadium-type floor. It is of “triodetic” construction similar to the United States pavilion at Expo '67 except that the structure also contains an inner sphere with acoustic treatment between the two forms. Cinesphere is equipped to handle all types of motion pictures in all formats. It contains the Imax projector which utilizes the rolling-loop method of projection with laterally running 70mm film with a 15-perforation “pull-across”; it is illuminated by a 25,000-W xenon light source. The booth also contains two 35/70mm projectors together with a Zeiss-Ikon 16B 16mm projector attachment constructed by Atlantic Films to slide into position in front of a 70mm projector, thereby utilizing the projector's 6-kW light source to project a picture 35 ft (10.67 m) wide."
"John A. Maurer, a pioneer in the development of 16mm and 8mm sound recording and reproduction, began an active and diversified career in 1929 when he left the Graduate School of Western Reserve University to go to RCA Research Laboratory in New York. Some years later he received the honorary degree of DSc. from Western Reserve."
"Notice is hereby given that the Annual Meeting of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, Inc., will be held at 1:30 p.m., local time, May 1, 1972, at the New York Hilton, New York."
  "This Program is the scheduling of papers within the sessions. It is as accurate and complete as possible. Before the Conference, however, papers may be removed or rearranged into other sessions. The sessions are firm. Questions about specific papers or sessions should be addressed to Society Headquarters, Att: 11th Conference—Technical Programs Coordinator, (212) 867–5410; Program Chairman Calvin M.

            "Film production versus electronic production of television programs is a subject about which there are many diverging opinions. These revolve around differences in the technical performance, the production and distribution techniques, tradition, philosophy or personal preferences. In view of the importance of this subject, it was thought that a useful contribution to the technology could be made through further investigation, including a direct comparison test. This test was recently conducted in the studios of the Sudwestfunk at Baden-Baden. — At first, the paper briefly summarizes the general merits and demerits of the two techniques, film and electronics; then the test procedure is described. Four typical scenes were taken simultaneously by electronic and film cameras, the film being in different sizes, 35mm negative-positive, 16mm reversal and negative-positive and super-8 reversal. The results were presented in short sequences with direct comparison by split-screen methods. Finally, the characteristic features of the results are discussed."
"The CBS Television Network has placed in service a computerized memory lighting control system using a new design concept. The system represents the first application of a stored-program “minicomputer” to stage lighting control. A television monitor display and light pen are used as the main indicating and control instruments, permitting a broad range of functions to be performed accurately in a control unit of small physical size. The system's physical configuration and operating characteristics are described."
"An optical low-pass filter is indispensable for a single-vidicon color TV camera, in which a color-encoding dichroic filter is used, in order to eliminate the interference between luminance and chrominance signals. Properties of a rectangular-phase grating are described from the viewpoint of application of the color TV camera. The grating placed in the optical system acts as a one-dimensional optical low-pass filter, its optical transfer function (OTF) decreasing linearly as the frequency increases up to the cutoff frequency. The cutoff frequency and the dc level of the OTF are expressed as functions of grating parameters. The cutoff frequency is unaffected by varying the aperture stop of the optical system. It is shown that the trapezoidal-wave phase grating is also useful for the optical low-pass filter."
"A system for recording color scenes using an ordinary camera with specially prepared monochrome film and a method for television projection are described. During camera exposure, the three color components of a scene modulate separate carrier gratings already present in each of three color-sensitized layers as preexposed latent images. After simple black-and-white processing, a clear transparency is produced, and a color television picture is obtained using a simple scanning system containing a flying-spot scanner and three photopickups."
"In the typical film processing situation the constant addition of the chemical replenishes in liquid form creates an overflow or effluent condition. The disposal of such effluents through sewage facilities wastes costly and potentially reclaimable solutions and adds to water pollution. Chemical mixing, storage and analytical test procedures have been devised whereby a high percentage of most effluents, formerly discarded, are now restored to replenisher condition and reused indefinitely. These procedures are carried out with no loss in image quality and with substantial reduction in both chemical costs and water pollution. Reclamation of the silver content from discarded film is also discussed."
"The widespread use of additive printing techniques has resulted in substantial savings in time and material compared with previous methods, but there are still many areas where substantial savings may be realized. One of these areas is the operations necessary for the generation of punched paper control tapes for additive printers. There are numerous procedural techniques employed to arrive at the tape for the answer print or first trial print, but subsequent corrections and duplicate tapes are time-consuming and costly to make. The tape-punching system described here has an input keyboard, a master program/display unit and a reader/punch module. It gives noticeably decreased operator errors and substantial manpower savings in the generation and verification of second-, third-, nth-generation tapes, using a compact high-speed optical tape reader and a high-speed, silent eight-channel paper tape punch. Simultaneously uniform hard copy* is produced, whenever desired."
"For reasons set forth it was decided to design a new format along with a new total system. Described are the ${3\\over4}$-in format, the videocassette with automatic threading mechanism, the color system and the duplicating system."
"The basic specifications of the Teldec video disc are given. Using the 625-line standard with 25 frames/s having a groove density of 140 per mm (3,556 per in), the playing time is five minutes. This has been modified for the U.S. standard. The 210-mm disc consists of a PVC foil which can be copied at high speed in special presses. The disc rotates on an air cushion rather than a turntable. The pickup process and the color system are described."
              "After giving a brief history of theater automation, the design goals to be attained for a fully automated theater operation are described. Several basic solutions to the main problem are set forth and reasons for trying to run a 35mm projector in reverse are given. Research and development necessary for achieving the successful reverse operation of standard 35mm projectors is described and conclusions drawn from practical experiments are given. Not only was it established that it is possible to run 35mm projectors successfully in reverse—an operational mode essential for projector automation—but it was also found that certain modifications made for reverse operation provided for a steadier projected image when running forward, with much less film “flutter” and a minimum of film tension. Motor drive, projector control signals, operational modes and auditorium control functions which were achieved in actual theater installations, are described and illustrated."
"In 1969, the Canadian Parliament passed an Act to establish a corporation to provide telecommunications within Canada utilizing communication satellite techniques. This corporation was named Telesat Canada and its financing was to be accomplished by issuing shares, equally divided amongst three groups representing the Canadian Government, the telecommunication common carriers and the general public. In accordance with its objectives, the Company has awarded contracts for the provision of three satellites and 35 earth stations which will constitute the initial system. Arrangements have been made with NASA for launching the first satellite in November 1972. The system will provide facilities for long-haul telephone message traffic and television and radio program distribution. The television and radio program distribution facilities have been designed to meet requirements of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. The major segments of the system are described, with special reference to the television distribution function. Television performance objectives and network operational requirements are related to the system design. New design features which contribute to the effectiveness of the system as a television distribution facility are reviewed."
"The Canadian domestic communications satellite, Anik,* is expected to begin operation in January 1973. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. will use Anik to obtain ready extension of its connected television networks to locations otherwise difficult to reach, for improvement of program distribution patterns for both television and radio, and refinements in network practices and technical quality. Two geostationary satellites, one for main service and one for back-up, will be orbited. With the advent of the satellite, the English and French language television networks will take the form of seven regional subnetworks in the South, with their central stations aligned roughly in an east-west direction, plus the group of remote stations in the North. A satellite link will also be utilized for radio."
"The principal characteristics are summarized for most international and national satellite systems that are either operational, in planning, or proposed. Technical considerations which necessitate different operational parameters in various systems are discussed. The need for artificial dispersion of the satellite emissions is explained. Finally, some prospective developments that may affect overall system cost are discussed."
"Studio program switchers are used to Select the proper picture(s) at the operator's discretion, either individually or in combination. Normally this is done by routing the video signals through different video devices, such as mixing amplifiers, special effects, etc. This delays the video signals, so the switchers must utilize secondary switching to put the processing devices in series or to substitute delay lines to maintain constant propagation delay through the system. To minimize the delay and to improve the quality of the picture, a new concept of parallel video processing has been developed. Time sharing and amplitude sharing are used to achieve MIX, WIPE, KEY, etc., leading to very good technical performance characteristics."
"A very-high resolution multispectral television camera system is being developed for NASA for use on the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) program. There are three cameras in the system, each viewing the same area but operating in the blue-green, red and near-infrared spectral bands. In the laboratory the cameras' limiting resolution is 4500 TV lines over the 25 × 25-mm image format of the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV). Analysis of typical ERTS scenes shows that actual contrast ratios will be much lower than those of laboratory test targets. A model was developed to predict the resolving power performance of the RBV camera under realistic conditions. The methods used are applicable to all types of imaging systems. To verify the model, tests were conducted using the RBV camera, a laser-beam image reproducer and a series of AF tribar test patterns of known values of contrast. As a more graphic demonstration, simulated multi-spectral images were generated using color-IR photographs from Apollo 9."
"The theory of the potentiometric method of analysis is reviewed and a suggested modification to the currently used method of bromide determination is included in order to take into account the build-up of chloride due to developer effluent reclamation."
"To determine the validity of claims that, with an increase in speed, running style changed in respect to center of gravity, forward lean, knee lift and the type of foot contact with the ground, a photographic analysis of eight subjects was performed. The film was studied using a motion analyzer and, by means of a computer program, the frames showing the foot-contact phase were plotted continuously. This method of analysis proved quite valuable in isolating the importance of the ankle joint at contact and permitted discrimination of movement at time intervals of less than 1/300 s."
"It is the author's intention to call attention to some of the historical contributions made by Dutchmen to the development of cinematography, some of whom have not received their fair share of recognition. The contributions of four Dutchmen are briefly considered: Gemma Frisius (1508–1555), Cornelis Drebbel (1572–1633), Christiaen Huygens (1639–1695) and Petrus van Musschenbroek (1692–1761), with references to others whose contributions are doubtful or have not been substantiated. The invention of the cinématograph by the Lumière brothers in 1895 has been arbitrarily chosen as the end of the historical period under consideration."

"This standard prescribes the mechanical, electrical, and test requirements for the design, construction, and installation of electric penetration assemblies in containment structures for stationary nuclear power generating stations. The electric conductor and insulation characteristics of external circuits which connect to penetration assemblies are beyond the scope of these criteria. If there should be any conflict between this standard and those documents referenced herein, this standard shall take precedence over the referenced documents."
"This standard pertains to direct-acting overcurrent, reverse-current, and undervoltage tripdevices of both the electromechanical and ac solid-state types integral with low-voltage ac andgeneral-purpose dc power circuit breakers covered by American National Standards. The solid-statedirect-acting overcurrent trip devices may include ground trip elements. These direct-actingtrip devices are sometimes referred to as \"opening releases,\" especially in IEC (InternationalElectrotechnical Commission) Recommendations or \"Specifications\"."
"This application guide applies to AC high-voltage circuit breakers rated in accordance with the methods given in American National Standard Rating Structure for AC High-Voltage Circuit Breakers, C37.04-1964 (R 1969) and listed in American National Standard Preferred Ratings and Related Required Capabilities for AC High-Voltage Circuit Breakers, C37.06-1971. Circuit breakers rated and manufactured to meet other standards, or used in switchgear assemblies, should be applied in accordance with application procedures adapted to their specific ratings or applications."
"This standard covers requirements for the pressurized components of AC high-voltage circuit breakers."
"This guide applies to low-voltage power circuit breakers of the 600-volt insulation class with separately mounted current-limiting Class J and Class L fuses for use on ac circuits with available short-circuit currents of 200 000 amperes (rms symmetrical) or less. Low-voltage integrally fused power circuit breakers (see American National Standard Low-Voltage AC Integrally Fused Power Circuit Breakers, C37.28-1969) and combinations of fuses and molded-case circuit breakers are not covered by this guide."
"The purpose of this recommended practice is to provide guidelines for the proper application of electrical equipment to packaging machinery which will promote: (1) Safety to personnel and equipment, including the reduction of fire and accident hazard (2) Uninterrupted production (3) Long life and low maintenance cost This is a minimum recommended practice and is not intended to limit or inhibit advancement in the areas of electrical or mechanical engineering. This recommended practice covers the application of electrical equipment and wiring furnished as part of a packaging machine, and associated equipment commencing at the place of connection of the power supply. It shall apply to electrical equipment for use on circuits which operate from a supply voltage of 600 V or less. It shall not be considered adequate for machines intended for use in locations designated as hazardous by the NEC (National Electric Code), NFPA 70-1971 (ANSI C1-1971)."
"This standard covers capacitance current switching requirements for ac high-voltage circuit breakers rated in accordance with methods given in American National Standard Rating Structure for AC High-Voltage Circuit Breakers, C37.04-1964, and listed in American National Standard Schedules of Preferred Ratings and Related Required Capabilities for AC High-Voltage Circuit Breakers, C37.06-1972.2 It is anticipated that the manufacturers of circuit breakers will expend efforts to meet the requirements of these new standards as soon as possible. However, it is recognized that this will require time for completion; users are cautioned to confer with the manufacturer as to whether a specific design meets these standards. Circuit breakers manufactured before the publication date of this standard may not meet its requirements; the manufacturer should be consulted concerning the capacitance current switching capabilities of these earlier designs."
"This standard covers requirements for switching-impulse voltage insulation strength for outdoor AC high-voltage circuit breakers having rated maximum voltages of 362 kV and above."
"This test procedure is intended to give a direct evaluation of the composite insulation system of an oil-immersed distribution transformer, tested as an integral unit. It is to be noted that the oil in which the transformer is immersed is to be considered a part of the insulation system. It is the intent of the procedure to provide that each component of the insulation structure operate during the test under conditions which are, as nearly as possible, the same as those that it would encounter in service. Thus, it is intended that each component be evaluated in accordance with its actual function."
"This standard covers requirements for the external insulation of outdoor ac high-voltage circuit breakers rated on a symmetrical current basis."
"This standard describes parameters and methods of measurement suitable for the characterization of varactors intended for large-signal application. This will be done by reference to the parameters and methods prescribed in IEEE Std 318-1971, Trial-Use Guide on Solid-State Devices: Varactor Measurements, Part I - Small Signal Measurements, where they are applicable, and by modification and supplementation of them where necessary for use with large-signal devices."
"The purpose of these definitions is to foster uniformity and standardization of language among engineers engaged in reporting, analyzing, and predicting outages of transmission and distribution facilities and interruptions to customers. While the proposed definitions are not intended to be specific instructions for reporting outages of facilities and interruptions to customers, use of standardized definitions should facilitate exchanges of data between workers in the field. The preparation of standard definitions of terms may be regarded as a first step before pooling of data between utilities can be successfully accomplished. The work of preparing this publication was carried out by a task force of the System Operations Subcommittee of the Power System Engineering Committee of the IEEE Power Engineering Society."
"The knowledge of the recorded signal amplitude on a magnetic record (which may be in the form of a tape, a disc, oτ a perforated film) has several practical uses: (1) for determining and standardizing references for the levels of audio programs on these magnetic records; (2) for specifying the recording-performance properties of magnetic media (for example, the distortion versus flux, etc); and (3) for measuring and specifying the sensitivity of reproducing heads (and also, by reciprocity, recording heads). The quantity for specifying the recorded signal is the short-circuit magnetic flux, sometimes simply shortened to flux. Several possible methods exist for measuring tape flux, but the measurement given here involves only the use of a calibrated ring-core head which is described in the reference of the standard. Note that the present standard measurement is only for \"medium wavelengths\". A further standard method for measuring short-circuit flux at long wavelengths and at short wavelengths - that is, the \"frequency response\" of the flux on a magnetic record - is under consideration. The technique utilizing a calibrated ring-core head to measure directly the flux at medium wavelengths is superior to magnetometer methods and to \"single turn head\" methods which have been used in the past because the head is easily manufactured using highly perfected commercial methods. The transducer (head) is commercially available to any laboratory at a reasonable cost; it is easily used, and requires no specialized auxiliary equipment. A further advantage of this method over magnetometer methods is the elimination of the errors inherent in making the \"transfer\" recording which is necessary for a magnetometer measurement. This standard represents the joint efforts of the Recording and Reproducing Standards Subcommittee of the Standards Committee of IEEE Group on Audio and Electroacoustics and the Sound Engineering Committee of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. It was originally prepared by an SMPTE Ad Hoc Committee as a method of measurement of flux on magnetic sound tracks used in motion-picture films, and was later modified for measurement of recorded flux in any form of magnetic sound record at medium wavelengths. This standard specifies a method of measuring the recorded flux per unit width of a magnetically recorded test signal at medium wavelengths for all magnetic sound record formats. It also specifies the equipment needed to implement this method."
"This document presents criteria, essential elements, and new and revised definitions for excitation systems as applied to electric utility synchronous machines with particular emphasis given to the application of solid-state devices and to terminology common to feedback control systems."
"The purpose of this standard is to establish uniform procedures for the measurement of radiation of radio noise from overhead power lines with meters that conform to American National Standards. A uniform procedure is a prerequisite to comparisons of radio-noise performance of various overhead power lines. The procedure applies in the frequency range of 0.015 to 30 MHz. A procedure for measurements in the frequency range of 20 to 1000 MHz, which is to be used only as a guide, is also presented."

"This guide has been prepared to aid in the effective and uniform application of fuses, relays, and their associated switching equipment located at the point of interconnection between the utility and the consumer electrical systems. Descriptions of the various devices, definitions of terms, and references to other technical technical publications have been included to make the guide useful not only to relay engineers, but also to other technical people who may not be intimately familiar with the art of relaying, but who nevertheless have a responsibility for the installation and operation of such interconnections. It includes examples for relaying of typical installations, both with and without consumer generation, and with service from utility radial or loop feeders, either directly from the utility substation bus or from a transmission line. It is expected that the guide will be used by consulting engineers, utility relay and sales engineers, and by consumer engineering and maintenance personnel. The scope of this guide does not include the subject of lightning protection for electrical systems as provided by shielding or lightning arrester devices. Lightning is, of course, often the cause of short circuits on power systems, but only the clearing of these short circuits through the use of protective devices is within the scope of this guide. Reference material pertaining to lightning protection may be found in (1) IEEE Std 28-1972, Surge Arresters for AC Power Circuits (ANSI C62.1-1971) (2) ANSI C62.2-1969, Guide for Application of Valve-Type Arresters for AC Systems. This guide does not establish standards or recommendations with regard to personnel safety at the interconnection area with respect to ground-voltage-rise, transferred-potential, step-potential, and touch-potential considerations for faults on the utility system or on the consumer's system. Reference material pertaining to grounding and safety may be found in the following: (1) IEEE Std 80-1961, Guide for Safety in AC Substation Grounding (2) ANSI C2.2-1960, NBS H81-1961, Safety Rules for the Installation and Maintenance of Electric Supply and Communication Lines (3) ANSI C1-1971, NFPA 70-1971, National Electrical Code."

"The Federal Communications Commission has been staffing a regional office in metropolitan Chicago as part of its Regional Spectrum Management Program. The regional approach will take advantage of local peculiarities in enhancing optimization of spectrum usage and achieve better coordination between the Commission and the spectrum users."
"Recent tests conducted by personnel of the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine demonstrate a wide range of electromagnetic radiation susceptibility among different types and models of cardiac pacemakers. Pacemakers made by seven different manufacturers and representing the vast majority of implantable devices currently being marketed were tested. Many of the tests were performed on pacemakers implanted in large canines having surgically induced atrioventricular heart blocks. Eleven discrete frequencies between 10 MHz and 3050 MHz, pulse repetition rates from 0.5 to 360 Hz, pulse durations from 0.5 to 5 msec, and E-field.strengths up to 800 volts/meter were used in this series of tests. Field intensities as low as a few volts per meter caused complete inhibition (cutoff of pacemaker activity) of some pacemakers, whereas others in the same tests were essentially unaffected in fields 100 times higher. These test results, plus data from other similar studies, indicate a need for further improving of such medical prosthetic devices in order to be compatible with the ever-increasing electromagnetic radiation background found in many major metropolitan areas today."
"The fact that electromagnetic fields can affect implanted cardiac pacemakers has been documented. This paper describes an experimental program in which the effect of extremely low-frequency (10-100 Hz) magnetic fields on cardiac pacemakers was studied. The primary objective of the program was to determine a threshold for a magnetic-field effect in this frequency range. A secondary objective was to establish a method and criterion for evaluating the interference effects of low-frequency magnetic fields on heart pacemakers. Both laboratory bench tests and in vivo tests using calves were performed."
"The primary purpose of this particular program was to evaluate the susceptibility of heart pacemakers to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). The forward objective of the program was to develop a prudent method of test that could be adopted by pacemaker manufacturers for product quality control."
"The important parameters which must be considered in structuring a testing program to evaluate the susceptibility of pacemakers to electromagnetic energy have been discussed. Of primary importance is the consideration of factors which influence the consistency or repeatability of the tests, and include: the nature of the fields used to excite the devices, the orientation of the leads and the method used to monitor the pacemakers response. The use of uniform propagating waves, simple geometry lead dress with consistent orientations relative to the fields and nonconductive monitoring links should help considerably in the interpretation of data taken as a function of other electrical parameters, e.g. excitation frequency. These measures, if standardized, should also aid greatly in the comparison of test results obtained by different investigators. In addition to the control of the above factors, the modulation placed on the exciting field should be standardized, since the pacemaker behavior is highly dependent on the modulation. The use of modulations which are not constant in frequency appear to have an advantage, since they more closely simulate the complex modulations which can be encountered in practice."
"The Office of Telecommunications (OT), Department of Commerce, was tasked by Executive Order to provide administrative, kesearch, engineering, analysis and technical service to the Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTP) in support of its Federal Government Spectrum Management responsibilities. OT has developed a four-element program structure to provide this support encompassing the areas of frequency management; spectrum analysis; information central; and, spectrüm engineering, development, test and evaluation. There are many spectrum management processes and all are to be supported by this capability. The growing requirements for the use of the radio spectrum to support the Federal Government's telecommunication mission-oriented requirements necessitates an improved engineering capability for spectrum management purposes."
"At the request of the Office of Telecommunication Policy (OTP), the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) has been working on the Electromagnetic Compatibility of 1600 MHz systems that include Collision Avoidance Systems (CHAS), Radar Altimeters, and proposed satellite systems. It is important to recognize the constraints imposed on each new system's design by the electromagnetic environment it must operate in and, conversely, what impact that system may have on the other systems operating within or near the frequency band. This paper presents recent work at ITS which is representative of all three classes of system development: (1) operating radar altimeters, (2) developed prototype CAS equipment, and (3) proposed general specifications for Air and Marine Mobile satellite communications."
"Frequency allocations have been made which allow broadcasting satellites to share certain bands with the fixed services. As it happens, many of these fixed services now in existence use troposcatter links, a mode of transmission that appears to be particularly susceptible to interference and particularly likely to cause interference. Techniques have been developed to estimate the interference levels involved and to recognize situations of potential incompatibility. We would conclude that frequency sharing is possible, but that it requires some care."
"The purpose of this paper is to describe activities of the Office of Telecommunications, Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (OT/ITS) in signal and noise spectrum occupancy. Topics discussed are signal occupancy, man-made noise data, and models of man-made noise. Planned future activities also are presented. The work is being performed in the Radio Spectrum Occupancy Group of the Spectrum Utilization Division of ITS."
"An instrumentation system has been developed with sufficient sensitivity and bandwidth to demonstrate compliance of electroexplosive devices with the 20 dB safety margin specified by MIL-E-605ID. This paper describes rationale used for sensor selection, the properties of the sensors which were selected and the steps required to assemble a complete instrumentation system and conduct a susceptibility test."
"New weapon system specification attempts 'to.clarif y the steps a contractor must take to obtain a confident indication of both intra-system and intersystem EMC performance. By way of examples, it illustrates how the contractor can base his system evaluations on the operational performance requirements of the equipments involved and the deployments of such equipments. And it recognizes that, in order for the contractor to effectively do this work, he must be provided with specific inputs from the Navy."
"This paper discusses the general types of instrumentation used in digital circuits to perform safety-margin measurements during system compatibility tests. It classifies the general purpose Multichannel Analyzer as a candidate for such instrumentation, and proposes crossover gating of the device to provide real time pass-fail safety-margin decisions for a large class of digital functions encountered in typical systems. It also proposes the use of the device with or without crossover gating for gathering noise baseline data in statistical form to facilitate evaluation of critical circuit safety margins during long term quality assurance programs."
"Complexities introduced by specification requirements for radiated susceptibility testing with very high level E-fields are considered. Techniques are presented for generating relatively high-level test fields throughout the frequency range 0.014 MHz to 25 MHz by utilizing a specially configured rod antenna. Personnel hazards associated with high-level radiation are defined; test surveillance systems are proposed that enable test personnel to operate and monitor equipment from the test chamber exterior."
"As opposed to narrow band transmission systems (TV or telephone) modern digital electronic systems (e.g. computers) are susceptible primarily not to typical spectrum configurations of the interfering voltages but to the shape of interfering pulses characterized-by parameters all lying in the time domain e.g. peak amplitude, maximum slope, length of maximum slope and pulse area. There are two possible ways to obtain information about interfering pulses and their shape: One way is to measure the amplitude spectrum by a set of narrow band receivers working in parallel and to develop the pulse shape or the significant parameters from the measured spectrum using a frequency-time transformation. The second way is to apply time domain measurement. The most useful method is the acquisition of the interfering voltage by signal sampling combined with an evaluation of the significant parameters by digital computing. Furthermore oscilloscope measurements can be applied. The comparison shows that time domain measurement and analysis has the advantage that it delivers directly and more accurately the pulse shape and any parameters that are significant for interfering effects in broadband systems."
"This paper introduces some of the efforts recently inaugurated at the Army Electronics Command to develop the next generation of receiver susceptibility limits. These new limits will be based on a statistical scoring technique and therefore, require that a receiver's susceptibility characteristics be completely described. To insure that the level of test effort is contained within a reasonable scope, associated test methods will emphasize integration of engineering analysis with collection of measured data. In the process of developing applicable analysis models for receiver intermodulation rejection requirements, it was determined that most present test specifications and procedures are based on inadequate rule of thumb guidelines rather than fundamental engineering laws. Additionally, it was established that all test data has been derived by sampling only a very few (usually three) test frequencies with no consideration to how the total number and relative amplitudes of intermodulation responses varied with receiver dial frequency. To eliminate the above shortcomings, a detailed frequency analysis model has been derived which establishes the interrelationships between receiver dial frequency IF, local oscillator frequency, IM response order and total number of probable IM responses. The paper presents the above derivation, illustrates its application to common EMI receivers and summarizes' measured data in support of stated conclusions. The objective is to show that application of engineering analysis can produce more informative data in terms of worst case and typical performance characteristics while simultaneously removing existing redundancy in data collection' The. information content is directly applicable to preparation of (l) EMI Control and Test. Plans as rèquired by MIL-STD's 461, 462 and 469; (2) interference prediction analysis as specified in MIL-E-6051D; (3) collection of spectrum signature under MIL-STD-469; (4) frequency assignments for.cosite installations, and (5) inputs for receiver design tradeoff studies."
"An international field strength survey on field strength meters and environment has been carried out mainly to state the reliability of field strength tests through the discrepancies of their indications and therefore to establish which accuracy an apparatus complies with specified radiation limits. The interference radiation limits have been specified in the CISPR recommendation and in the national regulations of many countries. On an absolute and on a conventional statistical basis this survey shows the test uncertainty to be expected, which is caused by: the measuring set itself, its test environment and the test procedure. These results could be incorporated in the international interference limits of interference radiations or, they should lead to a well-founded statistical interpretation of the test values in order to avoid that disagreement occurs between various laboratories on acceptance or rejection of the same checked equipment."
"The paper discusses an approach for reduction of conducted electromagnetic interference existing in electronic circuits by designing in a maximum slewing rate for the switching circuitry. Stewing rate is defined as the maximum rate of change of current with time which normally occurs at the activation and deactivation of power to a load during rise and fall times. Previous techniques considered only the rise and fall time points of switching waveforms ignoring the waveshape during the interval which resulted in significant differences between predicted and measured interference for various: loads. It is shown that a simple slewing rate tool can be used to give a more accurate prediction of conducted electromagnetic interference. Consequently, simplicity for the designer is achieved by determining the maximum slewing rate for meeting military conducted electromagnetic interference limits without performing a Fourier Spectrum analysis. The designer has only to refer to a graph and determine the maximum current change in a known time interval or vice versa and design the switching circuitry accordingly. Likewise, switching circuitry with high slewing rates above the maximum allowed level can then be easily identified either analytically or experimentally with the use of an oscilloscope. Laboratory substantiation utilizing the slewing rate tool is presented with conclusions drawn on the applicability of slewing rate limits to current waveforms."
"This paper reports on technical efforts undertaken for the purpose of enhancing electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) during the functional integration and operation of digital transmitters with digital and non-digital receiving equipments. The EMC enhancement is to be realized by imposing (1) equipment level limits on the transmitter output spectra and/or (2) system level constraints on the equipment deployment. Efforts reported herein are concerned with the overall system model employed, submodels representing the individual elements of the total system, initial calculations which indicate performance degradation within the system, and potential limits to be applied as a result of this performance degradation."
"The performance degradation of noncoherent, nonerror correcting digital communication systems from simulated AM, FM, SSB and pulsed interference is examined. The on-off keyed (Al), frequency shift keyed (F1), frequency shift keyed amplitude modulated (A2) and pulse code modulated FM (F9) digital communication systems are examined for errors of commission (false alarm) and omission (false dismissal). The most susceptible digital modulation system that was examined was Al. The simulated SSB interference caused the worst degradation to all the communication systems. The results of the SSB interference measurements closely agree with the theoretical results for narrowband noise. The results of this analysis show that the digital communication systems examined have error probabilities less than one part in 104 for on-tune signal-to-interference power ratios of 11 dB or greater."
"Results are presented for susceptibility measures obtained from typical PCM-FM and 4ΦDPSK receivers simulated on an analog computer. Interferencè added at the antenna includes Gaussian noise, FM, CW, PCM-FM, 4φDPSK, and pulsed CW. Gaussian noise was most perturbing followed by like interference and CW. The slope of error rate versus I/C was not as steep as analytical predictions. Among susceptibility measure procedures outlined for digital receivers, the jitter measure of the quasianalog signal from its expected value in absence of interference is recommended to augment bit error rate measures. Test procedures and susceptibility limits for digital receivers are presented."
"An extensive computer simulation has been developed to study the susceptibility of digital receivers to various interference sources. Receivers using PCM-FM and four-phase DPSK modulation techniques have been programmed on EAI 8800 analog computers containing large complements of digital logic elements. Emphasis is placed on the use of these simulations for susceptibility studies, but their use is not restricted to these studies. The adaptability of these simulations to various versions. of PCM-FM and four-phase DPSK receivers can be accomplished by making small changes in the modulation and demodulation techniques discussed. By using the analog computer it is possible to model various types of interference sources. This eliminates the necessity for outboard electronic gear to represent the desired interference sources.Analog programming techniques also proved very valuable in generating various indicators and measuring devices, This also eliminated several pieces of outboard gear, making each simulation a compact piece of instrumentation. The \"hands-on\" approach to simulation, which is available only to the analog programmer, allows the investigator to rapidly change configuration of the receiver model and interference sources. The methodology of analog/hybrid simulation allows easy access to various junctions within the receiver. Various interferences were modeled and applied to desired points within the receiver simulations. Some of these interferences were continuous wave (CW), various frequency modulated interferences (FM), and radar interferences. Also modeled were PCM-FM and four-phase DPSK interferences. A secondary use of the simulation would be its use in the modification optimization and design of a receiver. A future addition to the receivers simulated will be an automatic control of the simulation from a digital computer. This automation will enable one to sequence through various tests automatically and perform some analysis and plotting functions now being accomplished by hand."
"In 1959, the Department of the Navy initiated action to establish a national standards committee on radiation hazards. These efforts resulted in the establishment of what is now the Americas National Standards C95 Committee on Radio Frequency Radiation Hazards. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and Department of the Navy - Naval Electronic Systems Command - are currently co-secretariats of the committee. This paper briefly traces the history and role of ANSI, summarizes past and present standardization efforts of the C95 committee and outlines some of the problem areas which have been encountered with the present ANSI C95 standards."
"The Project Sanguine Environmental Compatibility Assurance Program (ECAP) is an integrated approach for resolving both technical and public concerns related to the total environmental impact of a proposed Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) Communications System. The ECAP Program is somewhat unusual because it represents an integrated, iterative process between environmental compatibility and electronic system design concepts. The total environmental assessment includes electromagnetic interference, biological, ecological, and major construction issues. Environmental research and development is performed concurrent with conceptual system development instead of the traditional approach of post-design side effects studies. This more realistic approach permits environmental compatibility to influence early system design parameters, thereby emphasizing the avoidance of potential problems through selective design studies during the influential early phases of the project."
"This report describes the results of a census of soil arthropods from different habitats at the Sanguine Wisconsin Test Facility near Clam Lake, Wisconsin. Arthropod abundance in the proximity of a power substation, in operation for a much longer period of time, was likewise unaltered by any electrical factors peculiar to this environment."
"Depressions in growth rate were observed in chicks continuously exposed to the following signals up to 28 days of age: (1) the near field of a UHF signal at 880 MHz, with a calculated average power density of 33 μW/cm2; (2) the near field of a VHF signal at 260 MHz, with a calculated average power density of 33 μW/cm2; (3) a low frequency electric field at either 45 or 60 Hz with calculated electric fields of 36 and 34 V/cm, respectively; and (4) a low frequency magnetic field at either 45 or 60 Hz with 1.4 and 1.2 G measured values of magnetic fields. No significant differences in feed utilization between control chicks and chicks exposed to the UHF and VHF signals were noted. Feed utilization between control chicks and chicks exposed to the electric and the magnetic fields was different and varied depending upon the experiment."
"In the 1900's when electrical power systems became widely spread, it was natural that shortly thereafter people began to worry about shock hazards. A 5 milliampere test level was accepted as the maximum current that could be allowed to pass through the intact skin surface without causing permanent injury. Underwriters Laboratories tests all electrical appliances for a safe 5 milliampere limit. Tests at the 5 milliampere level have served home appliances and industrial apparatus satisfactorily. Until recently, these limits served hospital electronic equipment rather well. The technological advancement of electronics in medicine has far exceeded the 5 milliampere standard. At this time, Underwriters Laboratories is currently developing a new proposal of standards for medical and dental equipment. 11 Recent concern for patient safety has been accelerated by the publication of studies on the susceptibility of a body to electrical current under different circumstances."
"Two isolated cases of power line filter explosions were resolved by replacing the failed components. In one case a more reliable part was installed. In the other, a protective shield was placed around filters to protect personnel. The real source of the problem was that circuit breaker ratings were too high and allowed filters to draw many times their rated steady state current under internal shorting. In one case this was further compounded by paralleled filters which shared the load current. Under internal shorting, one filter may still draw up to 364% of its rated current and the other up to 175% without actuating the protective line breakers. A study of shielded room facilities revealed eight examples of these conditions out of twenty installations surveyed. This hazard to personnel and facilities can be eliminated by installing line side circuit breakers, in series with each filter, that are rated at the filter's continuous duty current."
"This paper is specifically directed to the demonstration of the antenna to antenna compatibility analysis program (ATACAP) by comparing available measured data to computed data. A study was performed in support of the B-1 EMIC program by Radio Interference Control Branch of Aeronautical Systems Division (ASD/ENVCC). The study consisted of an antenna isolation analysis at various antenna locations on the aircraft using the (ATACAP) developed by MCAIR for AFAL. Comparisons were then made with antenna isolation test data obtained by North American Rockwell on a B-1 (1/12) scaled model."
"A systems approach to designing the antenna configuration and superstructure of the DD-963 Class Ship for electromagnetic compatibility is presented. Simulation of the topside electromagnetic environment and the various electronic subsystems is used to facilitate EMC analysis."
"Personnel in the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) area have provided specification compliance limits, techniques, hardware, and prediction and analysis models to the engineering fields for years in order to reduce electromagnetic interference between equipments. The EMC area has been growing all through the military and civilian environment. But, as the EC area grows so does the number of Radio Frequency (RF) equipments and users. This growth of RF equipments is staggering and is creating a severe problem commonly called \"Spectrum Pollution.\" A great majority of the RF spectrum pollution is caused by unintentional emitters (i.e., television sets, automobile engines, mix masters, etc.). But, eliminating unintentional emissions alone will not stop the problem. There is, however, another major source of RF spectrum pollution, which this paper deals with, and that is \"Unnecessary Emissions.\" This source of pollution is created by harmonic outputs, transmitter intermodulation, poorly designed EM transmitters, etc. This paper discusses the possible reduction of unnecessary emissions through the use of Operations Research Techniques. Specifically the paper proposes a method of assigning frequencies to collocated transmitters such that the total amount of transmitter intermodulation signal power emanating from a transmitter site is at a minimum. The paper discusses a realistic problem of eleven transmitters collocated on an actual transmitter site. A criterion function for reducing spectrum pollution due to transmitter intermodulation signal power (TISP11) is discussed. A sample problem is solved involving four transmitters, and a discussion of the results is given. A portion of this paper is devoted to the derivation of the operations research technique employed to obtain the solution of the sample problem. The technique can best be described as a two-fold procedure of the Branch-and-Bound Technique. The first procedure is to obtain a maximum value of the criterion function (TISP11), for each frequency/antenna assignment, that is independent of all other assignments. The second phase is to determine the frequency/antenna configuration that minimizes the independent maximum values of the criterion function paper, the criterion function derived, and the approach taken are open for discussion as far as accuracy of the results obtained. But, the applications of Operations Research Techniques to the EMC area to reduce RF spectrum pollution requires further investigation because, the possibility of a large pay off to the EMC community definitely exists."
"An approach is made to the problem of calculating transmission through a partial shield when the aperture in the shield is not small compared to a wavelength. The approach is \"elementary\" in the sense that gross approximations are used or suggested for four components which can contribute to the transmission to a remote receiving point. (1) (2) (3) (4) transmission through a mesh-shield. leakage through narrow slot-like imperfections in the jointing of the mesh. diffraction around the edges of the aperture. reflection from directly illuminated metal objects. The conclusion is reached that the use of partial shielding is worth investigation when a general attenuation of 15-20 dB or less in a given general direction is required."
"A prototype low-frequency magnetically shielded room sized enclosure was designed and fabricated. The present enclosure was intended to be the first stage of a broadband design. Some shielding theory is given, and the design approach is discussed. Shielding effectiveness data is presented and compared to the performance of other types of enclosures at low frequencies, and analyzed in terms of background requirements for low-frequency MIL-STD EMC methods."
"RF shielding and electrical properties of boron and carbon fibre reinforced composites were measured by inserting materials, including control samples of aluminum, between small source and receiver coils and noting changes at the receiver. In the frequency range 10 to 500 MHz, parallel or crossed boron fibres and parallel carbon fibres have little shielding effectiveness. However, crossed carbon fibres have some useful shielding properties. The equivalent electrical conductivity for one type of material was measured as 0. 63 (10)-4 relative to copper."
"In the age of technology our society is becoming increasingly more dependent on electricity. Electrical power supply, communications, data processing and automation are all steadily growing fields of application of electricity. There is as yet no sign of this development slowing down or reaching a point of saturation. Thus the various electrical systems will become more and more closely intermeshed; but in doing so they must not exert an intolerably high mutual influence on one another. A certain amount of interaction between the various electrical systems is inevitable. We know that electrical energy is not transmitted in the lines, but in the space surrounding them. The conveyor of the electrical energy is the electromagnetic field. The line merely assumes the role of a \"guide rail\" for the electromagnetic field. Strictly speaking, each individual circuit requires the entire space. This fact is the foundation of wireless telegraphy, in which the interactions between electrical circuits are exploited."
"A lightning flash to an aircraft does not occur instantaneously; it develops over a period of many microseconds. A study was made of the effects at the surface of a simulated aircraft to show some of the effects of an approaching lightning flash on the electrical field strength at the surface of the aircraft and on the currents drawn from protruding objects on the aircraft prior to complete electrical breakdown. Of particular interest was the manner in which these prebreakdown currents produced voltages across loads simulating avionic equipment connected to antennas and the manner in which these prebreakdown currents affected the operation of the lightning arresters installed to protect such avionic equipment."
"A new compact lightning arrestor can be incorporated into a connector housing to protect missile, aircraft and ground systems from lightning energy that can sometimes be transmitted to sensitive components on wires that pass into component compartments. This energy can cause component burnout, ignition of explosives, and circuit malfunctions. By properly incorporating the lightning arrestor-connector, these effects can be minimized or eliminated. The lightning arrestor-connector concept has been theoretically studied and prototype devices have been tested extensively at Sandia Laboratories. The design and development of the device is described along with data demonstrating the device behavior under simulated lightning tests."
"The research program being conducted by the U. S. Navy on the Sanguine System concept of an Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) communication system includes Interference Mitigation (IM) research to ensure system compatibility with public utilities. As part of this program, the U.S. Navy constructed a temporary test facility in Wisconsin, for the purpose of developing, testing, and demonstrating the effectiveness of techniques to eliminate (mitigate) the interference on public utilities produced by an operational ELF communication system. The IM research included an extensive two-year experimental test program at the Wisconsin Test Facility. The IM test program conducted on power systems as well as brief discussions on the Sanguine System concept, ELF interference effects, IM techniques, and the Wisconsin Test Facility are described in this paper."
"The international satellite GEOS will carry very sensitive electromagnetic wave-field experiments operating in the frequency range 0 - 54 KHz. It is essential that the satellite does not interfere electromagnetically with the function of the experiments. One of the most severe problems is posed by a pair of electric sensors having a sensitivity of 100 μV/m at zero frequency and 1pV/m for frequencies up to 70 KHz. These sensors are located at the ends of two diametrically opposed 10 metre radial booms. A major source of on-board electric interference is the body mounted solar array, due to the sensor passing through the spatially stationary field of the array as the satellite rotates and by scintillation of the finite module distribution. This interference can be minimised by special design of the solar generator, A second source of interference not discussed in great detail here is due to the potential acquired by the spacecraft by the various charging mechanisms. Solar array generated interference has been investigated by the development of an accurate computer model, and the results have been verified by two independent experiment techniques. The electric field computation is based on the derivation of the potential at a point knowing the potential distribution over a sphere. A cylinder was approximated by a series of coaxial equal radii spheres where the potential distribution over the cylindrical solar array is represented by mid-bands of potential on each of the spheres. The field was then computed by superposition for different solar array configurations. The results show that a compensating centre-tapped lay-out referenced to zero potential and with limited parallel redundancy is sufficient to keep this interfering field below the sensitivity of the experiment. Model measurements were made in an electrolytic tank giving an order of magnitude agreement with the computed field values. A second experimental verification has been made using a life-size model of the spacecraft and a sensor of the GEOS experiment type. Considerations of the charging mechanisms of the spacecraft body imply a careful choice of the materials making up the exterior surfaces based on their secondary emissive and photo-emissive properties."
"Voice communication receivers frequently encounter interference as a result of radar systems operating in the same general vicinity. Although the resulting interference may not completely prevent communications, it does have several undesirable effects. The most notable effects are operator fatigue and loss in communication range. To insure that these effects are given proper consideration during system planning and design, it is necessary to have a capability for analyzing pulse EMI effects in voice systems. This paper presents mathematical expressions that may be used for this type of analysis. These mathematical expressions define the relationship between desired signal and pulse interference conditions at the receiver input and audio performance at the receiver output. The expressions relate audio performance to significant input signal parameters such as desired signal level and frequency, interfering signal level and frequency, pulse width, pulse repetition rate, pulse shape, and receiver bandwidth. Comparisons are made between calculated and measured performance over a wide range of values for the input signal parameters including both on-tune and offtune interference conditions. The results presented in this paper provide an insight into the mechanism of pulse-to-voice degradation and a technique for calculating voice system performance in the presence of pulse interference. The relationships are simple, fundamental in principle, and require a.minimum amount of readily available information for their implementation."
"A mathematical model was developed to determine the susceptibility of a circuit package to magnetic fields (for frequencies below 200 MHz). The model was obtained from experimental and theoretical studies on an integrated circuit package that used internal ground and voltage planes. The magnetic field susceptibility is determined using the effective loop area formed by a logic signal line between two circuits on a circuit board containing an internal ground plane. The types of interconnections considered were: single-conductor wire, twisted-pair cable, twin-lead cable, and tri-lead cable. Experimental data were obtained on an operational circuit package consisting of two boards populated with cards and modules. The circuits were exposed to. electromagnetic fields generated by various continuous wave and broadband noise sources. The noise from these sources represents certain electromagnetic fields found within the normal environment of a computer system."
"Parameters describing the susceptibility of receiving installation to interfering electromagnetic field are discussed and appropriate measuring methods devised. As a result of an extensive analysis of the complex system of transmitters, interference sources and radio receivers in the range of 0,15 to 1000 MHz, susceptibility limits are proposed and their values compared with measurements on production-type receivers."
"A description of the ECAC a priori environmental data base is presented. Included in this data base are equipment oriented and frequency oriented data on C-E equipment. The collection and maintenance of each type of data is discussed. The use of the data in EMC analysis is illustrated with a sample problem. Control measures for improving the data are described along with methods for evaluating its quality."
"The requirement for a Data Base containing mobile communication-electronic equipments for use in EMC analysis is presented. The initial approach to developing this Data Base is discussed, followed by discussion of recent development efforts to be more responsive to EMC project requirements considering the mobile environment. Five categories of mobile platforms are identified, their differences described, and rationale for handling in the Data Base presented. The continuing program of Data Base improvement and enhancement is described and possibilities for increased capabilities in the future are discussed."
"Computer technology has kept pace with the ever-expanding requirements for computer power at ECAC. Assuming orderly expansion in the ECAC Data Base and project computing requirements, computer manufacturers are marketing, at present, systems which will accommodate these expanded requirements in the foreseeable future, say, the next five years. The far distant future is less certain. However, based on the improvements that have occurred to the state-of-the art of computer technology during the past years, there is every reason to believe that similar improvements will occur in the future."
"The length of the average system development cycle is such that the question of spectrum impact must be examined long before the actual operational environment can be clearly defined. The necessity for early evaluation of spectrum availability and environment compatibility causes special analysis problems for the system planner. He must locate and assemble data which will define the expected usage of the spectrum at some future date. He must then assess how that usage will affect the prospects of his system, even though he may not know specifically how his system will be ultimately deployed in the environment. If his assessment is negative, then he must develop viable alternatives or discontinue the development."
"Simulated signal densities, data rates, and signal power levels from land-based transmitters, as functions of either time or geographical location, can play a most important role in the design of transmitting and receiving systems. To a large extent, the accuracy of the simulation controls the utility of such information. Given reasonable accuracy, however, convenience of use of the information may decide how much the simulation is employed and, in the end, how useful the simulation really is. This paper describes a set of computer tabulations that provide such data in several alternative forms. The tabulations have been used in the design of many aircraft and missile systems. They have been developed with the idea that the convenience of the user is paramount."
"Measurements were made of numerous interactions at a typical co-site installation; results were compared with predictions made by the Cosite Analysis Model (COSAM). Tests involved six AM voice communications transceivers operating in the 225-400 MHz frequency range. Twenty five frequency assignments were tested, with three different desired signal levels. Types of interactions included adjacent signal, spurious responses, spurious emissions, receiver and transmitter intermodulation (2 and 3-signal mixes; 3rd, 5th and 7th orders). Close agreement between measurements and predictions was obtained. Confidence levels are presented."
"Recent awareness to the problem of harmful exposure to microwave radiation has stimulated the search for convenient and accurate methods of measuring the intensity of this radiation. Although much has been accomplished so far, there remains much to be done. In particular, the aspect of broadbanding a given probe design is crucial if exposure to multifrequency radiation fields is to be anticipated. This paper deals with this question and describes the design and performance of a probe built in accordance with the principles developed in the theoretical portion of the paper."
"The design and development of a probe for measuring electric fields at extremely low frequencies is described. The probe is spherically shaped and relatively small (6.3 cm in diameter) and uses a fiber-optic readout so as not to unnecessarily disturb the measured electric field. The probe is capable of measuring fields between 10 mv/ meter and 100 voltsmeter. Problems encountered in the design and packaging of the probe and operational data for the probe are presented."
"The realization that power line frequencies, transients and harmonics can cause harmful interference to sensitive electronic circuitry and equipment has pointed out the need for the measurement of low-frequency (10 Hz to 50KHz) spurious emissions. This paper will describe some means for measuring low-frequency radiated emissions from electronic equipment in accordance with Methods RE01 and RE04 of MIL-STD-461A, -462, and -463. Test measurement equipment, recommended practices and suggestions for obtaining valid test data will be analyzed."
"In the recent literature several papers have appeared which discuss the significance of considering the effects of both the transmitter internal impedance and the load impedance when determining the transmitter harmonic output spectrum. The considerable variation in the range of predicted harmonic emission levels which accrue from high source and load VSWR and which include the effect of intervening transmission line has been aptly presented.1,2,3 It is the purpose of this paper to present the results of recently conducted measurements and analysis aimed at more accurate prediction of these effects in terms of the complex reflection coefficients of both the source and the load impedances which exist at the harmonic frequencies. An analysis was made of the constant absorbed-power contours which can be plotted in the complex load reflection coefficient plane for specific complex source reflection coefficients. These constant power contours are circles in the load plane, and if superimposed on Smith chart coordinates permit ready determination of the power delivered to any given load impedance at the harmonic frequencies. This pictorial representation thus provides particular insight into the effects of source and load reflections on the harmonic power output. Measurements were made of the transmitter power delivered to specially designed loads comprising transmission-line sections, tunable stubs, and a linear dummy load. These special loads were novel in that they could be tuned to produce a perfect match at the fundamental frequency, while known non-zero reflections were obtained at the several harmonics. Thus, in principle, load impedances which are conjugates of the transmitter source impedance are those which absorb maximum power. The transmitter load power measurements using these loads were in good agreement with the theoretical load power contours and permitted an indirect determination of transmitter internal impedance at harmonic frequencies. An analysis of the transmitter tank circuit was made for both the active and passive conditions of the final amplifier stage. These results which will be discussed show that the transmitter internal impedance at harmonic frequencies is the same for both conditions."
"As part of a research investigation to meet the need for better radio frequency suppressors to cure the increasing number of EMC problems on aircraft, it was decided to initiate a programme of basic work into Suppressor design and performance based on the characteristics of the individual components of passive suppressor networks. It was also realised that since suppressors always work into an unknown complex load which varies with frequency, the present method of defining the attenuation characteristics as an insertion loss measurement in a 50 ohms resistive system has little value, and a more realistic characteristic was required.This paper gives a brief description of the results obtained and discusses a more realistic attenuation characteristic together with a method of damping the resonances which occur between a suppressor and its load."
"Switching regulators have continued to gain popularity despite their tendency to generate EMI. The reason for this is because of their very high efficiency even with a large range of input voltage. This makes them ideal for aerospace equipment and for portable battery powered instruments. Low power loss also eliminates the need for large complicated heat sinks. Therefore, the switching regulator is here to stay and the EMC engineer must find ways to control its noise emissions. A thorough description of the widely used series bucking regulator is presented here as a basis for defining regulator characteristics. Criteria are then derived for the information needed to control EMI emissions and are used to define ."
"This introduction to the session on grounding describes objectives and presents the typical design problem which has served as a common topic for the several contributors. Grounding theory has lagged behind circuit development; the session aim is to make this clear and to foster interest in a general theory of grounding. Launch facility design is selected as the focal point of interest for the session."
"The discussion here focuses on these grounding allusions - and how it is assumed that everyone knows what to do when we mention single-point ground, shield ground, static ground, power ground, single ground, digital ground, etc. The approach chosen centers around the topic of the entire grounding session of this symposium: \"how to establish a compatible ground.\" A problem is established where a grounding scheme for a smaller system - a spacecraft - is to be designed. The spacecraft was selected because of the author's familiarity with it; however, the problem could also be any other system to be integrated into a larger complex - for instance, a computer in a factory or industrial environment, a heart monitoring station in a hospital, or a digitally controlled traffic light system in a downtown area. Design requirements and the problems encountered are reviewed in detail."
"The grounding and bonding design problems associated with the series of questions listed by the session chairman (Mr. T. Herring) are evaluated. In each of the four (4) problems, the possible design solutions (decisions) are placed in a statistical decision matrix where possible outcomes are listed. An attempt is made to list the programatic costs associated with each decision. The final decision is then stipulated with regard to the expected costs in terms of system performance."
"Empirically derived curves which display the effects of near-field antenna coupling in the presence of metal obstacles are presented and discussed. The changes in boresight coupling between near-field antenna pairs due to intervening sharp-edged metal sheets and round metal cylinders of various sizes located at intermediate ranges between the antennas were measured for three antenna separation ranges. The measurements were performed with each antenna pair same-sense polarized for both horizontal and vertical polarizations at C-band and X-band frequencies. The effects of various parameters such as the antenna separation distance, type of obstacle, size of obstacle, location of the obstacle between antenna pair, polarization, frequency of operation, and ratio of the transmitting aperture dimension to the receiving aperture dimension are observed in the families of empirical curves."
"Simple equations are derived which describe the coupling that exists between two monopoles located on a common ground plane. Maxwell's integral equations are reduced to a matrix equation by the method of moments. The matrix equation is then specialized to describe the coupling between antennas collocated on a common ground plane. A technique to predict the coupling between two monopoles is derived and used to generate the data for a 0.25λ transmitting monopole coupled to a variable length receiving monopole and for a variable length transmitting monopole coupled to a 0.25λ receiving monopole. Other uses of the coupling equation derived from the method of moments technique are given."
"A survey of interference prediction of antenna systems in terms of radiation pattern is presented. The mathematical model of the antenna pattern prediction is discussed to indicate the direction being taken in shipboard antenna system compatibility analysis. A computer-aided model is presented for determining the antenna element currents whose overall radiation pattern may be specified. A demonstration of the applicability of this model is also presented by analyzing the desired radiation pattern for several situations."
"Much of the antenna coupling prediction and specification work done for EMC relies on the mean and/or median of the gain values taken in dB of the antenna patterns concerned. Often the measured Pattern Distribution Function (P.D.F.) is approximated by a cumulative normal probability function of the dB-gain-values and its median or mean and standard deviation is taken as indication of the EMC performance of the antenna. The question is raised whether a criterion can be found which is more directly related to the operational EMC performance of antennas. It turns out that such a criterion exists and is closely tied to the straight average of gain rather than the average of dB-values. For antenna patterns with cumulative normal P.D.F.'s a closed expression for the difference between dB and straight average is found. It is shown that the difference between the average or median dBgain and the straight average of the gain is typically 10-20 dB but may be even higher. The difference varies strongly with the standard deviation of the pattern distribution function."
"Electric and magnetic near fields of straight skewed wires are treated. Hazard criteria are discussed. Typical results are presented, which show the dominant role of mutual effects in near fields."
"The characteristics of a thin-wire, finitegap, half wave dipole fed with a length of two wire transmission line has been studied using matrix methods. Transmission line length and gap size have been varied obtaining the complete solution (current distributions, impedance and far field beam patterns) in each case. Significant departures from the ideal are found even for electrical ly small gap sizes and line lengths. The departures consist of distortions in the far field patterns and a widened range of input impedances. When the departures are small, they can be described adequately by the relative magnitude of cross polarized field components and by null fill-in."

"Appendix 1"
"The electrostatic phenomena associated with the retention of surface charge by insulators is of considerable current research interest. The impetus is gained from industrial static electrification problems and the increasing utilization of the phenomena in modern technology. It has been shown, further, that surface charges influence the electric strength of insulators,1 the adhesion of dielectrics,2 and numerous nonelectrical applications of synthetic polymers including biomedical engineering.3"
"The largest class of electric field meters is that of the rotating vane, or vibrating probe, type. These meters measure the electric field by the charge induced on a sensor plate. Sensitivity is enhanced by varying this charge periodically, either by shielding the probe with a rotating or sliding shutter, or by modulating the capacitance of the probe, for example, by vibrating it. Although the physical construction and sophistication of these meters can vary greatly, they all register this modulated probe charge."
"In his 1971 Whitehead Memorial Lecture,1 Hyde discussed the versatility of silicone fluids, resins, and elastomers with emphasis on the potential of these materials in new insulation systems."
"In a previous study,1 it was reported that for a cable insulating mineral oil, the activation energy for dielectric relaxation is non-Arrhenius (the plot of the frequency of maximum dielectric loss against reciprocal absolute temperature is nonlinear), similar to the activation energy for viscosity. However, the temperature dependence of both activation energies is significantly different. This is shown for a new oil (#336) in Figures 1 and 2."
"In Part I1 it was pointed out that a comparison of ac and dc conductivities of liquid hydrocarbons was of interest both from a theoretical and a practical point of view. The availability of a very versatile yet very sensitive transformer bridge by the General Radio Company has made it possible to measure ac conductivities as low as 10−18 (ohm cm)−1 over a wide frequency range. Initial results reported in Part I on n-hexane, cyclohexane and benzene indicated reasonable agreement between ac conductivities extrapolated to zero frequency and values obtained from dc measurements."
"The present work continues the investigation of electric field behavior between parallel-plate electrodes immersed in nitrobenzene and strives toward the realization of a Kerr cell which insures uniformity of the inter electrode field under various HV pulse, dc, and ac operating conditions. Our earlier direct voltage studies1,2 are extended to include Kerr effect investigations of field distributions resulting from high pulsed (μs) and 60 Hz alternating voltages. Recently developed methods,3 employing high-speed photography for recording of transient fringe-pattern data, are utilized for visualizing time and space variations in the pulsed and ac fields. Minimization of the effects from the fringing fields at the electrode ends permits both the observation of space-charge behavior under direct and alternating voltages and measurement of the Kerr constant of nitrobenzene. Voltages are measured simultaneously using calibrated (with state-of-the-art accuracy) devices. Brief descriptions of the techniques employed and some typical results are given in the following paragraphs."
"Whenever a liquid dielectric is used as an insulant in an electrical apparatus, it is necessary to provide an insulating mechanical support to hold the conducting members at the required spacing. The space between the conductors is therefore bridged at some point by a solid dielectric. It is found in practice that the solid surface bridging the conductors is a weak point electrically. It is commonly assumed that the electric field at a point on the interface is in some manner made greater than the breakdown field of the liquid and then the surface flashover is initiated by a discharge in the high field region. In order to understand the reasons for the lowered dielectric strength it is desirable to know how the solid spacer changes the field distribution between the electrodes, and the dependence of this change on the dielectric properties of the solid and upon time. Probes have been used to map the field within a dielectric liquid1 but distortion of the field by the probe is possible and time variations are difficult to observe, therefore an alternative means of field measurement was sought. The Kerr effect2 has been used to measure electric fields in situations where there is little or no distortion3 and has proved to be a reliable, precise, instrumental technique. The work reported here is a study of field distortions produced by solid dielectric spacers in pure nitrobenzene where the field is measured by the Kerr electrooptic effect."
"The importance of particulate charge carriers in insulating liquids has been known for some time. It has been shown1 that many conductivity measurements can be explained on the basis of particulate carriers shuttling charge back and forth between electrodes. It has also been postulated that particulates may have an effect on the mechanism of electrical breakdown in insulating liquids."
"There is still no one unified theory which is capable of explaining the following four high-field phenomena beyond doubt: (i) the breakdown strengths of dielectric liquid, gassed or degassed, increase with increasing hydrostatic pressure for pressures between 1 and 20 atmospheres1 and such a pressure dependence diminishes with decreasing duration of the applied field;2 (ii) the conduction currents are independent of hydrostatic pressure up to a guage pressure of 150 lbs/in2 for field strengths up to 90% of the normal breakdown stress but the pressure suppresses the current burst;3 (ii) the electron multiplication due to impact ionization does not take place in n-hexane at field strengths up to 1.2 MV/cm;4 and (iii) the threshold field for the onset of light emission in n-hexane is less than 90% of the normal breakdown stress and the light always commences in the cathode region regardless of the geometry of electrode systems used. 5 In the following we present some new results of prebreakdown electroluminescent phenomena which may have an important bearing on the mechanisms responsible for electric breakdown in liquids."
"Several methods1–7 have been described in the literature for determining the energy distribution of surface states in MOS devices. Most of these methods are made under quasi-static or steady-state conditions, and use ac measuring techniques. Here we describe two techniques that involve dc measurements made under non-steady-state conditions. These techniques are simple to implement but provide considerable information concerning the properties of the traps at the silicon-silicon dioxide interface. These two techniques are (i) the thermal method which involves making a plot of the nonsteady-state current vs. temperature (I-T) as the temperature is raised at a uniform rate, and (ii) the isothermal method in which the nonsteady-state isothermal current is measured as a function of time (I-τ). These two methods will now be discussed in turn."
"The performance of transistors (IGFET), diodes (PIN) and metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) devices potentially depends upon the stability of the dielectric between the semiconductor and the gate electrode. The flat band shift1,2 under the bias-temperature stress caused by ionic mobile charges present in the dielectric(s) is among the most significant instabilities. The magnitude and the nature of these charges are dependent mainly upon the processing conditions and the parameters of the insulating layer(s). Extensive work by previous investigators1–3 has traced the major source of this ionic drift instability to the presence of sodium."
"The breakdown strength of liquids has been known to be highly dependent upon the dissolved water and air content, decreasing with increasing impurity levels. By means of the Kerr effect, it is shown that the static electric field distribution between parallel plate electrodes in chlorobiphenyls is dependent upon the impurity levels. Near breakdown however, the local cathode field strength remains unchanged regardless of the impurity levels introduced. The observed phenomenon is consistent with space charge theories of breakdown previously not shown experimentally."
"Any electrode system immersed in an insulating medium must invariably involve solid insulators in some part of the supporting structure. When an electric stress is applied to the electrodes, the solid dielectric fails by a surface flashover along the dielectric. At stresses much below the flashover stress, glows or incipient discharges occur. Optical observations of these early discharges in high vacuum and SF6 environment, using a high speed image intensifier/converter camera, are reported below."
"The dielectric permittivity, loss tangent, and breakdown strength of various insulating materials were studied under the simultaneous action of ac and dc voltages. This paper reports on the changes in dielectric loss."
"Much research has been devoted to the study of conduction in polymer and liquid dielectrics, however, little effort was given until the last few years to the study of conduction in the more complex case of a polymer impregnated with a liquid. Recently polymers impregnated with dielectric fluids have gained wide acceptance for use in capacitors and are being considered for use in cables and other high voltage equipment because of their low dielectric loss, high corona start voltage, and high dielectric strength. An understanding of conduction in these impregnated polymers is of importance for the design of high voltage equipment using these materials."
"A bakeable, ultrahigh vacuum, time-of-flight mass spectrometer has been constructed in order to investigate, for the first time, the nature of the ion species formed prior to the flashover of a parallel plate diode.1 During operation, the field in the gap of the diode is maintained approximately 5% below that required for visible flashover. The anode is biased at some positive potential, VB. When a high voltage pulse, −Vp, is applied to the cathode, the ions formed at the anode surface or in the gap of the diode are accelerated and pass through apertures in the cathode, striking an electron multiplier detector one meter away. The time interval between the resulting signal amplified and displayed on an oscilloscope, and the beginning of its sweep triggered by the pulse applied to the cathode is a direct measure of the ion's travel time, T. If the duration of the cathode pulse is long compared to the travel time of the slowest species in the gap of the diode, and if an ion's initial kinetic energy is zero, its identity can be determined from the expression: m/n (amu) = 0.196/L2 VB [1 − d/D(1 + VP/VB)]T2 where L is the cathode to detector distance, d is the distance from the species formation position in the gap to the anode, and D is the gap spacing. Here all distances are expressed in meters, all voltages in kilovolts, and the travel time in microseconds. Since ions will only be detected for O ≤ d/D (1 + VP/VB) ≤ 1 the extent of ion production in the gap can be probed by varying the ratio of the pulse-to-bias voltage."
"Optical microscopy1 has been used for many years to investigate the damage caused to the surfaces of solid dielectrics by gaseous electrical discharges; transmission electron microscopy2 has also been used. Scanning electron microscopy3 enables surface effects to be observed in much finer detail and with greatly enhanced depth of focus. Recently, the use of the scanning electron microscope for examining the deterioration produced by discharges in mica-based materials forming the insulation of electrical machines has been reported.4 The scanning electron microscope is now being employed to study the effects of electrical discharges in internal gaseous cavities in solid organic dielectrics and this paper describes the technique which has been developed. Experiments to date have given new information on the fundamental processes involved, and have indicated a mechanism whereby the solid dielectric becomes eroded."
"The deterioration of dielectric materials under electrical discharges by the growth of a three dimensional pattern of irregular carbonized tracks diverging from a central stem was originally investigated in connection with the “tracking” failure of impregnated paper insulation. 1 More recently, research has been concentrated upon the characteristics of this type of failure in solid, synthetic hydrocarbon and other polymeric dielectric materials, where the failure is now described generically as “treeing.” There appear to be two basic varieties: “discharge (or electrical) treeing” which exhibits various geometrical forms initiated from high stress concentrations at discontinuities or from voids, and “chemical treeing” which proceeds at low voltage stresses and is associated with the penetration of moisture and water-soluble impurities into the dielectric. The elucidation of these mechanisms of deterioration is facilitated by an accurate and detailed study of their physical characteristics, and a number of useful techniques have been evolved."
"In this study of volume discharges and treeing we have abandoned uniform field electrode systems and are using sharp-pointed electrodes which permit us to observe the progressive development of channels referred to as “trees” or “dendrites.”"
"Rapid propagation of breakdown channels through insulation can occur under quite diverse conditions. With relatively low alternating stress 1 kV/mm), breakdown by treeing is the culmination of prolonged degradation by erosion, pitting, or chemical degradation by low energy discharges.1,2 If the stress is raised, pitting occurs more rapidly and need not progress so far before treeing occurs; thus the life of insulation decreases rapidly with increase in stress. With sufficient stress, discharge channels can apparently penetrate insulation without causing previous damage.2"
"Recently, treeing breakdown has been identified as an important factor controlling the long time breakdown of polymer insulation systems. However, due to its complicated nature, the mechanisms involved are not yet fully understood. Using experimental results from other investigators, together with our own, this paper reviews the mechanism of voltage-induced treeing breakdown by dividing it into two stages: tree inception and tree extension."
"It is frequently assumed that composite insulation, consisting for example, of a column of air in series with a solid dielectric, breaks down because a discharge in the weaker gaseous section acts like a thin conducting extension of the electrode. The applied voltage is conveyed by the discharge channel to the stronger medium, which breaks down provided the stress concentration is such that the intrinsic strength is exceeded. However, the hypothesis requires examination because it implies plasma-like conditions in the discharge channel. It is necessary to establish the conditions permitting the growth of a discharge when normally the electron avalanches are quenched by the deposition of charge on the dielectric surface. The hypothesis implies that breakdown spreads from gas to solid, irrespective of polarity. Reason for doubting this was provided in this laboratory by A. Bradwell who, in exploratory experiments using a simple high-speed camera, observed the start of breakdown in the solid. The present work stems from this."
"The nature of gaseous discharges in voids plays an important role in the initiation and propagation of treeing. To investigate the mechanism of treeing, it is important to control the magnitude and the mode of the discharges, since these aspects are very sensitive to the overvoltage. In usual ac voltage applications, a combination of the time varying voltage and statistical time lag produces statistical fluctuations of overvoltages and distributions of charge magnitude. Devins et al.1 have initiated a method to control partial discharges by superposing small overvolting square wave pulses on a dc threshold voltage, in order to observe the current wave form."
"Partial discharges in cavities or cracks in polyethylene power cables frequently cause dielectric breakdown, and an examination of the prebreakdown features reveals the occurrence of tree-like growths. To understand the growth processes of trees in polymer materials, we have investigated the nature of treeing and the modes of discharges in trees and artificial cavities in some thermoset and thermoplastic polymers.1,2 The forms of trees generated by electric stress in polymers vary with the nature of the polymer material and the test conditions. Three types of trees are formed: tree-like, bush-like, and chestnut-like (with bur). We consider that the higher the pressure (in a tree) caused by gaseous decomposition products, the more the form of the tree changes from tree-like to bush-or chestnut-like. The present report describes the relation between the volume of gas generated in a tree and the growth and forms of the tree."
"In this study, the growth of trees resulting from electrical discharges in needle-shaped cavities in epoxy resin (EX), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and low-density polyethylene (PE) has been investigated. A single needle and a plane ground electrode system was used (Figure 1). The needle and cavity have a point angle of 30° and a radius of curvature of 3–5 μm. The cavity depth as well as the distance between the tip of the cavity and the grounded electrode are each 2 mm. Figure 2 shows photographs of the discharge light in the cavity and the tree for EX and PMMA. For EX, the discharge inside the cavity is a purple corona, but inside the tree, tiny intermittent orange or red arcs are observed. They are similar to scintillation-like discharges observed in tracking. They start after the growth of the tree has progressed 0.1 to 0. 2 mm, and they are intermittent, irregular, and unstable. For PMMA, the discharge light is entirely different: it is a purple corona throughout both cavity and tree. The tree channel width is narrower than in EX. For PE, in the early stages of tree growth the discharge light is similar to that for PMMA, but after the trees have grown to some extent the discharges resemble those for EX. By this time, the discharge light is orange and the tree channels have become wider. Figure 3 shows photographs of the trees. In EX, the trees have wide sections filled occasionally with carbon. It seems that the carbon deposits are the sites of the scintillation-like discharges. However, in PMMA, the trees are clear and hardly any carbon is found. The ease of formation of carbon in the three materials was in the expected order: EX > PE > PMMA."
"The importance of treeing as a mechanism of insulation failures has been established, particularly in the life of plastic-insulated cables.1,2 This paper describes some of the results of a study of the growth of trees grown from stress concentrations introduced into actual cable insulation. Frequencies of 60, 400, and 800 Hz were used to determine the relationship between frequency and the time to breakdown."
"In the course of our previous investigations of tree generation in insulation, the mode of initiation due to partial discharges in oxygen-rich (1016–1018 molecules/cc) spaces between conductor and insulation has been clearly identified. Furthermore, if the void is initially filled with an inactive gas, degradation is eliminated, but if the sample is then exposed to oxygen, tree initiation occurs readily once more. However, this sequence of events has only been established for large, well-defined voids. The present investigation has addressed itself to the mechanism of tree initiation and the influence of ambient oxygen atmosphere in essentially void-free insulation. For this purpose, samples of extremely pure polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) were used, to eliminate the influence of impure material on discharge degradation."
"Recent visual examination of unfilled polyethylene (PE) and cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) insulation removed from cables which had been in service for a number of years, revealed so-called treeing patterns in some of the examined specimens.1,2 Electrical trees, originated by partial discharges, have been observed for a long time in various types of insulation, including PE and XLPE.3,4 We have studied electrical treeing effects very broadly, and have come to the conclusion that this effect is considerably different from that causing trees recently observed in cable insulation.5"
"Because of superior electrical and mechanical properties, as well as favorable economics, today's demand in Japan for all types of solid dielectric insulated cables, especially cross-linked polyethylene (XLP), has greatly expanded. These rubber and plastic insulated cables are usually so simple to install and terminate that possible troubles due to adverse operating conditions (such as exposure to water) are sometimes ignored. Water in some form exists in practically all installation areas, especially underground. Therefore, it is essential to recognize and understand the possible deteriorating effects of moisture on these cables. The mechanism of the deterioration of XLP due to water will be discussed. Previously1 we have reported that the deterioration of XLP insulated cables due to water can be illustrated as shown in Figure 1. Under an ac voltage, deterioration occurs in three stages: first, rapid drop in ac breakdown voltage occurs while the drop in insulation resistance is negligible. Then further deterioration is quite slow. Finally the cable fails abruptly or has a sudden drop in insulation resistance."
"In Japan, cross-linked polyethylene power cables (CV cables) between 3. 3 and 6. 6 kV have been used for more than 10 years, either submerged in ocean water or buried in soil on land. Many trees have been found in failed CV cables and most of them proved to be water trees. In the USA, several kinds of trees have been found in cables in service.1,2 Water trees were also found in 6. 6 kV cables in accelerated tests in water in which temperature and applied voltage were elevated. The insulating characteristics of these cables (i.e., breakdown voltage, tan δ, and insulation resistivity) were found to be inferior."
"Water trees have been found in polyethylene-insulated cables.1 They occur in the presence of an ac divergent field in a polymer containing a certain amount of water. The trees are filled with water, contain impurities and might be oxidized. These characteristics indicate that mass transfer occurs in the ac divergent field, and that the phenomenon may be interpreted in terms of dielectrophoresis. Pohl2 has treated dielectrophoresis in liquids where a particle is polarized and moves into regions of highest field strength. In the present paper, the rate equation for particle density is solved by taking the dielectrophoretic and diffusive forces into consideration. Some experimental evidence is given which suggests there will be aggregation of water or impurities in water along the surface of a cylindrical conductor where the divergent field commences. While aggregation cannot be considered to cause water treeing, it may create a situation from which water trees could develop via other mechanisms such as chemical reactions or mechanical stresses caused by repeated expansion and contraction of water."
"Recently, a new mode of deterioration has been found in extruded polyethylene cables that could lead to eventual cable failure. The deterioration involves sulfide permeation and the resulting new type of treeing has been termed “sulphide treeing. “ Sulfides, such as hydrogen sulfide, permeate through the jacket and insulation to the metallic conductor, where, in the case of copper, reaction with the sulfide occurs to produce cuprous sulfide (Cu2S), which then crystallizes and grows into the insulation to form a dendritic deposit or tree. If the dendrites of Cu2S, a conductive material, continue growth through the insulation, electrical breakdown ultimately occurs. Since environmental pollution is present in Japan, the deterioration of cables by “sulfide trees” could become a serious problem, especially in chemical plants and the like. This paper describes the morphology of sulfide trees, their growth mechanism, and reproducible laboratory experiments to confirm these observations."
"The nucleation and growth under high voltage stress of tree-like shapes in solid dielectrics is a phenomena reported by many observers. The major investigative effort has been on dielectrics which are unfilled.1–3 Some investigations have been done on the effects of filler on high voltage treeing.4,5 This paper presents some observations of high voltage treeing made on point-to-plane models and cable sections containing steel needles. Tree growth inhibition caused by mineral fillers is demonstrated."
"Many investigations have been made of treeing phenomenon in polyethylene and cross-linked polyethylene. Usually, cross-linked polyethylene (CPE) chemically cross-linked with di-α-cumylperoxide (DCP) has a higher resistance to treeing than ordinary polyethylene (PE) when they are tested with the needle-electrode test method. However, it was found that, when CPE is dried, it has the same low resistance to treeing as PE. From this, it was inferred that undried CPE owes its higher resistance to treeing to the presence of acetophenone, a decomposition product of DCP, which, we suggest, exists in tiny voids at the needle tip and suppress discharges in such voids."
"Extruded dielectric cables employing cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) have been gaining increasing acceptance for voltages up to 138 kV in the USA, Japan, and some European countries. The successful introduction of this type of cable has been largely made possible by certain cost advantages, e.g., ease of installation, repair and simplified cable accessories."
"This investigation was initiated when samples of polyethylene-insulated 15 kV cables which failed were examined and trees were found in the insulation. These cables had been in service approximately eight years, had not been subjected to known abnormal service conditions and were considered typical of eight-year-old polyethylene insulated cables. Since the service life of these cables was anticipated to be 30 years or more, the failures and related trees were quite unexpected. As a result, sections of nonfailed and other failed cables were obtained and examined. Samples of 161 cables contributed by 28 utility companies were examined. Our earlier findings in this investigation have been recently discussed.1"
"The interest developed recently in the subject of “trees” in solid dielectrics has generated much activity in the search for trees on a random sampling basis. Many such instances of “trees” have been reported by investigators 1 but, in most instances, a detailed description of the cable, length of service, and life history of the cable are not available; therefore, a proper analysis of the treeing investigation is difficult or impossible to achieve. In this investigation, a 69 kV solid dielectric insulated cable was manufactured, tested, installed at a Southern California Edison test station, and operated under known conditions for a period of two years. The test cable was returned to us for comparison with a retained sample of the original cable."
"A number of workers have studied practical aspects of treeing and they have speculated on the mechanism of tree propagation.1–9 Short time electric strength tests under oil frequently produce tree-like patterns, apparently because the discharge channels in the oil behave as needle-like extensions of the electrodes.3 Formation of a branching breakdown channel is also a likely final phase of breakdown from corona erosion."
"High voltages in space and high altitude airborne equipment require highly reliable interconnections which makes the use of high voltage cables necessary. While it is possible to use sealed pressurized cables, the possibility of a leak means that the cable may pass through critical pressure while energized and failure may result. A flexible solid cable has an inherently higher reliability if the ordinary modes of failure can be eliminated. The most important modes of failure of high voltage cables are catastrophic dielectric breakdown and degradation due to corona discharges. The life of the cable is determined by the rate of corona degradation which is a function of the corona intensity in general, and in particular of the energy density of the corona in the largest voids. These modes of failure assume special significance for cables operating at high altitudes or in space vacuum due to the possibilities of exposing the series airgaps in voids or interfaces to low gas pressure. In accordance with Paschen's law, discharges will occur in these gas layers at much lower voltages and, thus, lead to corona at voltages which are lower than operating values."
"The experimental approach used in this work differs from that used by past investigators in three principal respects. First, a high voltage pulse which increases at 4 × 1012 v/sec to a value as high as 900 kV was used. Second, transient currents as high as 10,000 A were monitored from a cold planar cathode (located 1 to 19 mm from an identical anode) in a vacuum of 4 × 10−5 Torr. Third, the transient current and voltage were time correlated to within 4 nsec for an interval (usually less than 150 nsec) which was long enough for the negative slope in the voltage-current characteristic to appear. This technique has enabled the identification of several distinct stages in the discharge phenomena."
"An interesting phenomenon has been observed during the application of microsecond high voltage pulses across ceramic vacuum diodes (Figure 1). This phenomenon involves high level conduction and positive wall charging of the insulator. The phenomenon can be explained by a physical model involving field emission from the triple junction (insulator-cathode-vacuum interface) followed by electron avalanches on the insulator surface. The avalanche process has been studied with steady state voltages by Tourreil1 and Boersch.2"
"In high-pressure discharges, the glow discharge usually occurs only as a transient stage in the development of a spark, and studies of the characteristics of this glow have been confined to particular conditions in individual gases.1–4 The rapid development of high-pressure gas lasers which operate in the pulsed-glow mode5–7 has resulted in an increasing interest in the behavior of such glows, particularly in mixtures such as N2-CO2-He; the present paper is concerned with a preliminary study of breakdown and glow formation in these mixtures and of the effects of electrode spacing, gas pressure, circuit resistance, and gas composition on the glow energy and duration."
"In the year 1953 Cranberg1 proposed his clump theory to explain the breakdown of a vacuum gap. According to this theory loosely adhering charged aggregates of matter called clumps or micro-particles are released from the electrodes under the action of electrostatic force associated with the high field, and travel to the cathode gaining energy during the transit. The impingement of the clump on the opposite electrode is expected to vaporize enough electrode material into the gap to create a breakdown. Slivkov2 supplemented the above hypothesis by including the possibility of evaporation of the particle itself. While there is enough experimental evidence3–5 to indicate that the presence of such micron-sized clumps do initiate breakdown of a high-vacuum gap, there are no reports as yet, concerning the detection of any naturally occurring microparticles in a vacuum gap. In a 0. 5 cm vacuum gap operating near breakdown voltages (≃ 150 kV) particles which attain supersonic velocities will be of submicron size. A sub-micron size particle is unlikely to provide sufficient metal vapor on impact for a breakdown to occur. On the other hand, particles with very low velocities (V ≃ 0.5 m/s) should be large enough to be seen with the naked eye and are thus unlikely to be present in a vacuum apparatus. But microparticles with velocities 1–50 m/s are small enough to be easily detected but are large enough to initiate a breakdown. The experiment described below is designed to determine the presence or absence of such microparticles in an ultra-high-vacuum test chamber. Moreover provisions have also been made to elucidate the charge velocity and mass of such a particle as well as to provide an estimate of the number of particles that could emanate under any given conditions."
"Dielectric materials are often required to provide electrical insulation in a nuclear radiation environment. Typical applications are in reactor control and instrumentation circuitry, satellite electronics and in military electronic systems such as missile guidance. In some instances the radiation environment may be steady state and in others it may appear as a short pulse. If the radiation dose is sufficiently large there may be a degradation of the mechanical or electrical properties of some insulators. However, even a small dose, if absorbed in a sufficiently short time, may cause an unacceptable temporary deviation in the electrical properties of an insulator. These changes are manifested by a change in electrical conductivity or by photovoltages generated by ejection or insertion of photo-or Compton-electrons. From a macroscopic point of view the deleterious effects appear as a discharge of capacitors, a short-circuiting of cables and other insulation, or the appearance of undesirable electrical potentials at various points of the circuit. In this paper we shall consider some of the basic physical properties of the materials that contribute to these effects and the experimental and theoretical problems encountered in formulating a model to describe them adequately."
"The exposure of a polymer to high energy radiation causes excitation and the formation of reactive species (ions and free radicals). These reactive species may further react in two ways. They may proceed through a chain termination step, resulting in chain scission, or they may react further through recombination. If recombination is not geminate, cross-linking results. Both chain scission and cross-linking occur simultaneously, their relative extents depending on the material and experimental conditions."
"We have observed the flow of large photoconduction currents through thin sheets of polyimide insulation in which a high electric field was produced. With low fields and without illumination the test dielectric (Type H Kapton) is an excellent electrical insulator. The initial observation was made by chance by one of us (H. V. C.)."
"The electrical conduction of polyethylene is known to change after high energy irradiation due to both the remainder of excess carriers produced during irradiation and the occurrence of chemical and physical changes. Complexity may arise from the concurrent contribution of these two factors to the conduction process. One of the authors has reported previously that annealing above the melting point reduces the increased conductivity toward that of the unirradiated one. The present study was performed from the standpoint that experiments after annealing would give direct information about the conductivity of the irradiated polyethylene in which solely its chemical and physical structure is reflected."
"The single photon extrinsic carrier generation at the surface of anthracene crystals is attributed to singlet exciton-surface impurity interaction.1,2 This model is based on the experimentally well documented fact that the wavelength dependence of the photoconduction reproduces the crystal absorption spectra of the singlets and on experiments showing a decrease in the fluorescence yield with the increase of carrier generation. However, this is not in accord with data observed in the bulk where direct evidence was given for triplet exciton-trapped electron3 and triplet exciton-trapped hole4 interaction but no direct evidence could be obtained for singlet exciton-trapped carrier interaction. The experiment reported here was devised to see if the single photon extrinsic carrier generation can be linked directly to triplet-surface impurity interaction rather than to singlet-surface impurity interaction."
"The practical interest in the development of binary switching devices has stimulated a great deal of interest in amorphous semiconductors and, in particular, in the multicomponent chalcogenide glasses on which the most advanced “ovonic” switches are based. Switching glasses can have a variety of compositions: arsenic, tellurium, germanium, and silicon are among favored constituents. Switches can be made in two forms known, respectively, as threshold and memory switches. Their physical design is, or at any rate can be, the same, but memory switches are based on glass alloys with a lower glass transition temperature. The voltage-current characteristics of a threshold switch are shown by the full line on Figure 1. It consists of two branches, a stable OFF-state and a metastable ON-state. The ON-state requires a certain minimum holding current for its maintenance. The voltage characteristics of a memory switch are actually the same as those of a threshold switch, if the switching cycle is performed quickly, e.g., at 100 kHz. To obtain memory behavior, it is necessary to linger for a while (several milliseconds) at point P1 or P2. Only then does the low-resistance ON-state stabilize, as shown by the chain line through the origin. Return to the OFF-state is accomplished by means of a higher energy pulse which causes local melting or, at least, softening, followed by thermal quenching. These memories are “nonvolatile,” in the sense that the impressed information is conserved when all electrical signals are removed."
"Many experimental results and theories have been presented on the dielectric breakdown phenomenon of various thin films.1,2 We have studied the dielectric breakdown phenomenon of evaporated SiO thin films,3 and we found that the breakdown strength increased with decreasing thickness, but it was not influenced by the variation of temperature. From these experimental results, the breakdown mechanism of evaporated SiO thin films seems to be dominated by an avalanche. In this paper, the influence of the cathode metal on the breakdown strength of these films is discussed in terms of an avalanche breakdown theory."
"The electrical properties of the alkali-halides have been studied for many years, most of this work has been carried out using bulk single-crystal material. Due to the difficulty in producing crystalline alkali-halide layers there has been very little reported on the electrical conductivity and the dielectric properties of epitaxial alkali-halide films. Weaver1 studied the dielectric properties of many polycrystalline films; Macfarlane and Weaver2,3 reported further dielectric results particularly at very low frequencies. More recently Weaver and Lorenzoni4 gave details of the dielectric measurements made on LiBr films which had been previously evaporated onto low-temperature substrates."
"Practical superconductors consist of three elements: a core of superconducting material such as NbZr, a copper shrouding, and a layer of insulation around the copper shroud such as polyvinyl-formal. The core can consist of twisted strands of superconducting material or a single wire depending on the application and whether large transient loads are expected. Twisted strands are known to minimize losses with transients or ac variations. These variations can be responsible for losses in the superconducting wire and, hence, the wire will be subjected to Joule heating. This represents one kind of problem that can be encountered in superconducting current-carrying wires."
"To assist the design of an ocean cable system, we set out to make accurate loss angle, δ, measurements on the cable's insulating material (polyethylene, PE). A liquid-displacement technique using a Boonton Electronics Admittance Bridge (33B/1) gave very good precision (±5 × 10−7) at room conditions. However, to estimate the temperature and pressure dependence of δ, we also developed an air-cell method to avoid the problems of temperature and pressure dependence of the liquid's δ. The air method is described in this paper. Under ideal conditions (i. e., no change in sample δ), precision is ±1 × 10−6 (for δ ≃ 5 × 10−5) and accuracy is believed to be within 3 ×106 In essence, this is a method described by Hartshorn and Ward in 1935. Adaptation of this to the H-P 4342 A Q-meter was reported to us in 1971∗ by M. T. O'Shaughnessy of Phillips. We have employed in part his choice of apparatus and techniques."
"Conventional polymeric solids (pure, unfilled) have dielectric constants or relative permittivities, εr, in the range of about 1. 8 to 38. Recent years have seen a growing number of pure polymeric solids in which this value is exceeded. It is the purpose of this discussion to point out the types of homogeneous solids exhibiting such enhanced polarizations, and to suggest some of the reasons for it. We shall not discuss the problem of obtaining high dielectric constants by the use of fillers, etc., as in mixed phase dielectrics."
"It is well known that common polymeric solids such as polystyrene and polyethylene readily exhibit static electrification which is generated by contact with other solids. The possibility that significant charge can be generated in these materials during extrusion and other melt operations has not been considered at length although Hey I1 did briefly refer to the possibility of charge in the bulk of processed polymers."
"In 1960 Gubkin1 published an electrostatic theory of piezoelectricity which did not involve the microscopic structure of the electret. This approach would seem to be a good description of the phenomenon of piezoelectricity in polymer materials, many of which are partially or completely amorphous. We applied Gubkin's model to a specific set of experimental conditions, which resulted in some simplifications. These conditions are: 1. We measure changes in surface charge at nearly zero potential. 2. We use thin evaporated metal electrodes so that the electrodes change area in accord with changes in specimen area, A. 3. We consider only amorphous specimens which we assume to be elastically isotropic. 4. We assume the free charges to be frozen in the solid and to move in proportion to macroscopic strains, and the polarization charges to be rigid molecular dipoles whose positions move in proportion to macroscopic strains but whose effective total moment remains constant as long as the strains are isotropic."
"Ionic conduction of polymers has been proposed on the ground of the dependence of electrical conduction on the degree of their crystallinity: it was reported that the electrical conductivity of polymers decreased as the degree of crystallinity increased.1, 2 However, there are few reports on the relation between the degree of crystallinity and the electrical conduction of polyethylene (PE) which is one of the typical crystalline polymers. The main purpose of this paper is to clarify the effect of the crystallization of PE on its electrical conduction."
"This development was initiated by the need to construct an entirely new high voltage compact testing transformer system to replace an obsolete one. This presented an opportunity for innovations in design and application of modern solid state control circuitry techniques. The system has been in successful operation for more than three years."
"Many solid dielectric materials have an almost flat dielectric loss over a very wide range of frequencies extending in some cases over several decades between the subaudio and microwave frequencies. This flat loss is often accompanied by superimposed Debye-type loss mechanisms, giving pronounced peaks in more limited frequency ranges and producing the characteristic frequency dependence of the imaginary part of the dielectric susceptibility χ″(ω) ∼ ωτ/(1 + ω2τ2) (1) Here τ is the relaxation time corresponding to the particular loss mechanism and the relaxation frequency 1/τ may lie anywhere between infrared frequencies for atomic polarizations and subaudio frequencies for slow rotational polarizations, for example, in polymeric materials."
"ADA is an instrument the principle of which is based on empirical relations among rainfall rate, reflectivity, and attenuation. It is used in connection with a weather radar which provides a display of the attenuation due to rain at 10 GHz over the radar line of sight. With ADA a large amount of data applicable to the assessment and design of satellite communication systems can be accumulated in a relatively short period of time. It is estimated that the ADA-measured attenuations, expressed in decibels, are accurate to within a factor of two."
"Calculations of the propagation delay due to the atmosphere in satellite-to-earth communication are reported for the frequency range 1 to 15 GHz. A spherically symmetric, smoothly varying model is assumed for the atmosphere, and the techniques of geometrical optics are employed. The difference between the actual propagation delay and the delay which would occur in free space is presented for the lower atmosphere, the ionosphere, and the composite atmosphere."
"Attenuation due to rain at 10 GHz over the radar line of sight has been measured automatically during the past three summer seasons. Data from five months were analyzed to give statistics on the frequency of occurrence, the extent in azimuth, the duration, and the dependence on elevation angle of 5- and 10-db attenuation events. Results show that the frequency of occurrence diminishes rapidly as the elevation increases from horizontal to 10°, and is essentially constant from there on to 20°. 5 db is exceeded 10 hours per year at 3° elevation, 4 hours per year at 10°, and 3.5 hours per year at 20°. At all elevations 10 db is exceeded about one-fifth as frequently as 5 db. The azimuth extents of attenuating rain regions vary from 1°, the narrowest extent measurable, to values exceeding 60°. At low elevations the distributions of azimuth extent are strongly peaked at the narrow end. With increasing elevation the distributions flatten. The average azimuth extent of a 5-db region increases approximately linearly from 10° at an elevation of 3° to 33° at an elevation of 20°. For all elevations the average 10-db extents are about half the 5-db extents. The average duration of a 5-db event decreases from about 30 min at near-horizontal paths to less than 10 min at an elevation of 20°. For all elevations the average duration of a 10-db event is about two-thirds that of the 5-db event. These results indicate the characteristics of rain attenuation to be expected over satellite-to-ground communication links for the Montreal area."
"The lower wall of the Antarctic earth-ionosphere waveguide is composed of rock covered by an ice sheet, the depth of which can be an appreciable fraction of a wavelength at very low frequencies. The complex permittivity of the ice cap is therefore an important parameter in connection with the prediction of propagation velocities and attenuation in the guide over long paths on the Antarctic continent. This paper describes an experiment conducted near Byrd Station during November, 1971, in which the properties of the surface magnetic field between 5 and 20 kHz were measured in the immediate vicinity of a buried 34-km dipole antenna just under the surface of the snow. The related analytical problem and data reduction process are described briefly to clarify the means for converting the data into bulk average values of the complex permittivity parameter of the ice over the frequency range of interest. The resulting dielectric and loss parameters are new and have not been determined before in connection with the Antarctic ice sheet."
"Average ionospheric reflection heights are deduced for a trans-Antarctic propagation path between Byrd Station and Scott Base. A technique is described for making relative phase measurements on VLF transmissions at several phase-locked frequencies. Results are interpreted using waveguide mode theory which accommodates a horizontal dipole source and the effect of an anisotropic polar ionosphere. Reflection heights are presented for illustration during a period of solar activity in March 1969 and a quiet period in September of the same year; correlations are made with other indicators of ionospheric activity."
"For monostatic radar measurements of the correlation function in the lower ionosphere, suitably spaced short pulses must be transmitted in order to obtain adequate height resolution. The efficiency of the measurement is greatly increased if several (five or more) pulses, rather than the usual pair, are transmitted with a particular irregular spacing. With this procedure many delays (10 or more) can be studied simultaneously. The increase in number of lags more than compensates for the increase in clutter. Various such multipulse schemes are described and their merits compared. The rather formidable amount of data processing associated with these procedures often cannot be done with a general purpose computer but can easily be handled by special purpose digital devices."
"The construction of a Ku-band radio interferometer and some preliminary observations are reported. The interferometer was built for the purpose of mapping discrete radio sources like the Crab Nebula, Cassiopeia A, and Cygnus A. It has two 8-ft parabolic antennas operating at 17.128 GHz (1.75 cm). The maximum baseline of 100 m corresponds to a resolution of 35 sec of arc. A PDP-8 computer is incorporated in the system and is used for pointing, tracking, delay compensation, and real-time data analysis. The phase stability of the system was better than 10° over a period of 2 hours. Consistent fringe components were obtained from the Crab Nebula with a baseline set at 8 m."
"A solution is given for the boundary value problem of a wave propagating along a thin wire parallel to the interface between two homogeneous half-spaces. A general modal equation is derived for the propagation constant of the transmission current on the wire. It is shown how this result reduces to earlier known solutions obtained under more restrictive conditions."
"In this paper, some properties of the steepest descent path of the integral describing transient plane wave propagation in anisotropic cold plasmas are determined. The relationship of the steepest descent method to the possible arrival of evanescent waves is illustrated by a numerical example. Also, it is shown through error estimates that the result obtained by the steepest descent method is valid for finite z and large t."
"Using an idealized model, the attenuation rate of the lowest order mode is calculated for a range of deep crustal conductivities. It is shown that attenuation rates may he as low as 1 db/100 km at 1 Hz for a waveguide conductivity less than 10-6 mhos m-1"
"A theory of self-focusing of intense electromagnetic waves in ducts with parabolic and saturating nonlinearity has been developed. The relative effects of inhomogeneity in the refractive index of the medium, parabolic nonlinearity due to small electrical polarization of the medium, and saturating nonlinearity due to considerable electrical polarization on self-focusing have been studied."
"The upper and lower boundary conditions are important in theoretically modeling the height distributions of minor neutral constituent concentrations in the upper atmosphere by solving continuity equations. This paper discusses the effects of such boundary conditions on their concentrations. It is shown that the upper boundary condition of no diffusive flux at 150 km does not affect seriously the minor constituent density distributions except for H and HO2 above ∼120 km, where the escape flux of H reduces their concentrations substantially. It is also shown that our previous model calculations have used the condition of constant flux with height at the lower boundary. It is suggested that reliable measurements of minor constituents in the upper stratosphere may be useful in improving the lower boundary condition for the mesosphere models and in simplyfying the modeling procedures."
"As a step in determining the behavior of the D-region ionization at sunrise, the development of atomic oxygen and ozone over sunrise has been investigated taking into account the absorption of solar ultraviolet radiation by the time-varying, nonuniform ozone distribution over the mesosphere at sunrise. The dissociation rates of ozone and molecular oxygen are calculated and used to determine the time variations in the O and O3 densities at sunrise for a model considering only the oxygen allotropes. Transport processes were neglected in the sunrise calculations because chemical time constants are shorter than those for transport. However, the assumed initial presunrise atomic oxygen and ozone distributions, based on an average of theoretical and experimental results, do include the effects of transport. It was found that at altitudes from 60 to 80 km there is a delay in the ozone sunrise, and thus a delay in the development of the atomic oxygen density. [O]/[O3] was computed during sunrise, and a similar delay in its sunrise increase was observed. The production of metastable oxygen O2(1Δg) by the photodissociation of ozone in the Hartley band at sunrise was also investigated. A simplified chemical scheme for O2(1Δ) is presented, from which a closed-form solution for the O2(1Δ) densities over sunrise was obtained. O2(1Δ) may be important in the ion chemistry at sunrise, and can contribute to the early appearance of electrons in the D-region."
"The photodetachment rates of several negative ions believed to be present in the D region are estimated for sunrise conditions. The photodetachment cross sections of O− and O2− which have been measured in the visible and infrared wavelength ranges are used. Since the photodetachment cross sections of NO2− and NO3− are not yet known, the behavior of their rates could only be estimated. Infrared band absorption by H2O and CO2 is included in the calculations. For atoms and molecules with large electron affinities the ozone ultraviolet absorption is important. The effects of photodetachment on D-region behavior are discussed and found to be relatively unimportant."
"The growth over sunrise of the C and D layers of the ionosphere is investigated for a model which includes: the negative ion species O−, O2−, O3−, O4−, NO2−, NO3−, O3−, and CO4−; ion-pair production by galactic cosmic rays, precipitated electrons, photoionization of NO by scattered Lyman-α radiation, and the photoionization of NO and O2(1Δ) by direct solar radiation; the photodetachment of most of the negative ions; and the time variations of all these parameters. It is found that the inclusion of the reaction NO2− + O → NO2 + O2− with a rate constant of 5 × 10−14 cm3 sec−1 in combination with fast electron-ion recombination (α ∼ 10−5 cm3 sec−1) can accurately reproduce both the development of the C layer at sunrise and the correct magnitude and form for the D-layer development. The photodetachment of NO3− is not a suitable alternate source of sunrise electrons because of the large electron affinity of NO3. The photodetachment of lower-affinity negative ions, such as hydrated species, could replace the NO3− + O → NO2 + O2− reaction if indeed the presunrise mesospheric ions are predominantly hydrated. The dominant ions in the present scheme are NO3−, CO4−, and CO3−. Atomic oxygen greatly limits the quantity of negative ions above 75 km at all times of the day by associative detachment and is responsible for the night-time D-layer ledge of electron density. The 98 and 94° VLF radio propagation effects are explicable on the basis of this model."
"Continuous measurements of electron temperature and electron concentration were made at Jicamarca from 0700 to 0830 LT and from 1130 to 2000 LT during the great magnetic storm of March 8, 1970, when the F2 peak rose as high as 800 km. Continuous measurements of the vertical component of E × B drift were made from 1130 to 1730 LT. A synthesis of the observed electron concentrations was made using a model that solved the time-dependent electron-ion continuity equation for O+ and the molecular ions; the latter chemistry was included to improve the solutions at lower heights. It was found, using the observed values of vertical drift, that most of the observed features of the F2–region ionosphere were synthesized by the model. An interpretation of the synthesis that emphasizes the importance of horizontal diffusion at the equator is given. Observations are presented for March 7, 8, and 9, 1970, including the Huancayo magnetograms, which display a close correlation with the drift measurements."
"This paper announces the operational status of an auroral-zone incoherent-scatter radar. The Stanford Research Institute 1290-MHz incoherent-scatter radar, which was moved to Chatanika, Alaska (L = 5.7), an auroral-zone location near Fairbanks, is now producing interesting new results. The siting of the radar is such that D-, E-, and F-region incoherent-scatter measurements can be made without ground-clutter interference. Although coherent auroral-clutter echoes can at times be seen at relatively low elevation angles in the north, auroral echoes are sufficiently weak at 1290 MHz in the sidelobes of the antenna that they are not detectable during normal incoherent-scatter measurements. The capabilities of the radar system are outlined, and samples are presented of the type of incoherent-scatter results being obtained."
"This paper presents a computer technique for synthesizing an array pattern for the practical problem in which only the magnitude of the far-field pattern is specified. The general design problem is one in which both the currents and the spacings of the elements are allowed to be variables. The synthesis is based on a procedure which minimizes the norm of the difference between the Fourier coefficients of the desired and actual patterns. This criterion is very useful from practical design considerations since it allows one to determine a priori the highest order Fourier coefficient that can be approximated if the maximum array size is specified. Also, if no array size is specified, the procedure gives the array size necessary to obtain a given degree of approximation in the pattern."
"Pulse-compression techniques are now being used successfully in incoherent observations at Arecibo. In most observations a 13-bit Barker code and 6-μsec baud length are used, giving a compression ratio of 13 to 1 with very low range sidelobes and an altitude resolution of 0.9 km. A few of the first measurements with this technique are presented here and include observations of (a) the E region and sporadic E layers, (b) the D-region ledge near 80 km, and (c) narrow enhanced echoes associated with HF heating of the ionosphere."
"No abstract is available."
"The purpose of the present paper is to provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms involved in the trapping of energy which is propagated in an evaporation duct. The emphasis is upon the solution of the problem for simple meteorological models with the intent of not obscuring the important principles with involved mathematics or exhaustive computer studies. Simple exponential-type profiles are assumed, and the wave equation is solved for these profiles by the well-established methods of mode theory. The results allow for inclusion of a large number of modes but are restricted to trapped modes. The results indicated that, for cases in which multiple modes are trapped, considerable signal fades occur at two- to three-mile intervals for centimeter wavelengths and such fades are strongly dependent upon receiver or transmitter heights. Further, it was found that the duct height is not a critical parameter unless it is comparable with mode heights."
"The enhanced microwave attenuation in the altitude range between 35 and 52 km is explained by the assumption of an atmospheric layer consisting of water vapor and water droplets. The mass density distributions were calculated from the attenuation coefficient, and refractivity was measured during the Mariner 5 occultation experiment; temperature and pressure were measured by the Venera probes. These independent measurements lead to a reasonable altitude distribution of the water droplets and the water vapor content. The results show good agreement with assumptions which have to be made to explain the brightness temperature of the planet Venus."
"The transmission of high-frequency radio waves through the ionosphere is examined for a plane-stratified, isotropic ionospheric model and an impulsive point source. Explicit solutions for the path relations and the signal amplitude for the homogeneous-slab model illustrate the breakdown of straight-line approximations to the ray path. Implicit solutions for the path relations that are useful for iterative evaluation are also found for more general ionospheric profiles."
"The effect of mode coupling has been calculated for radio waves partially reflected from the lower ionosphere at vertical incidence. Calculations were made for parameters appropriate to the partial reflection experiments [Belrose, 1970]. The four reflection coefficients (two direct and two coupled) are calculated for a plane discontinuity using a matrix perturbation analysis. The ratios of coupled to direct reflection coefficients are calculated for a general one-dimensional reflecting layer using the coupled equations of Clemmow and Heading [1954]. At the highest electron density considered, 104 cm−3, about 10% of the reflected extraordinary wave amplitude might be due to coupling from the incident ordinary wave. The effect is smaller at lower electron density."
"Solar protons in the events of August 28 and September 2, 1966, produced phase disturbances on the 21.4-kHz VLF transmissions from station NSS, Annapolis, Maryland, to São Paulo, Brazil, and also on the 26.1-kHz VLF transmissions from station NPM, Hawaii, to São Paulo, Brazil. Both these paths lie well below the polar zone, but partially traverse the geomagnetic anomaly. A quantitative connection between the observed phase advances and satellite observations of the proton flux is used to calculate the length of path affected and the height changes in the disturbed portion of the waveguide. The VLF variations are accounted for by exponential ionospheric models with a reference height equal to the effective reflecting height of the sharply bound model."
"Simultaneous measurements of flare-enhanced electron density in the E layer and of flare-enhanced solar X-ray flux were used to evaluate the ionospheric relaxation time constant at E-layer heights. The method is an extension of Appleton's ionospheric “filter” idea to the case in which radiation flux and electron density fluctuations are simultaneously measured. Electron density measurements were made using the Thomson scatter technique at the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center, Arecibo, Puerto Rico. X-ray flux data in the 2- to 12-Å band were obtained from instruments aboard the Explorer 33 satellite. Measured values of time constant were converted to an effective recombination coefficient using the familiar Appleton formula and known values of the ambient electron density. Values for the effective recombination coefficient of the order 10−7 cm3/sec were obtained at E-layer heights."
"The excitation of parametric instabilities by radio waves in a magnetoplasma is discussed. A uniform medium is assumed and linear approximations are used. Excitation by a pump wave of ordinary polarization is hardly affected by the magnetic field. Low or zero frequency ion waves and high frequency Langmuir waves are excited simultaneously. For an extraordinary pump wave, the excited high frequency electrostatic waves are in the Bernstein mode. The threshold is slightly higher and excitation can occur only within certain ‘allowed’ frequency bands. A new type of parametric instability in which the excited waves are electromagnetic in nature and which is more strongly affected by the inhomogeneous nature of the medium is discussed qualitatively."
"An experimental investigation of the impedance characteristic of a spherical plasma probe has been carried out for a quantitative assessment of theoretical work, and of hydrodynamic or fluid theory in particular. A stable, low temperature (T ∼ 500°K) plasma was produced in nitrogen by a cold cathode discharge, with a plasma frequency of the order of 15 MHz and with an electron collision frequency in the range of 106 to 107 sec−1. The probe consisted of two hemispheres, one serving as a guard to eliminate the effects of the connecting leads; this geometry provided an almost purely radial electric field over the test hemisphere. Probe diameters ranged from 7 to 20 mm (10 to 30 Debye lengths). Hydrodynamic probe theory was tested against the experimental results for the specific cases corresponding to the probe at floating potential and at space potential. Good agreement was obtained for both the real and imaginary parts. The real part of the impedance shows a peak near the plasma frequency, a small shift being explicable in terms of realistic sheath profiles. Electron density can thus be deduced rather accurately, and electron temperature approximately, on the basis of hydrodynamic theory. Accurate values of the electron-neutral collision frequency were also obtained for plasmas where the collision frequency was larger than 0.4 times the radian plasma frequency. At lower pressures the presence of collisionless or Landau damping was clearly established, and the more accurate kinetic theory is necessary to explain the experimental results."
"We consider a bare antenna consisting of two line elements driven by a VLF source and immersed in the ionosphere. Nonlinear effects associated with high voltages up to 1000 volts and with an additional induced ν×Β·1 voltage are included. The applied voltage is visualized as a dc effect. For various instantaneous voltage values, we obtain the distribution along the antenna of voltage and resistive current, sheath size, and charge per unit length. At the feed points, waveforms for the charge and both resistive and displacement currents are illustrated, assuming an applied cosine voltage form. Averaging over a cycle yields, as a function of peak bias voltage, the average power dissipated in collection of particles from the medium, the average work done in moving charge between the two half-antennas, and the average sheath conductance and capacitance. Numerical results are given for three altitudes and two antenna lengths."
"The Valley Forge-Wallops Island bistatic radar has routinely identified high-altitude clear-air atmospheric targets. Bistatically detected target signatures are interpreted in terms of layer and distributions of scatterers. Simplified numerical models appear to explain well the layer signature characteristics. Locations of bistatically detected targets are compared with locations of meteorological features and monostatically detected atmospheric targets. Comparison shows the advantage gained when bistatic radars complement monostatic observations of clear-air atmospheric targets."
"This paper presents an investigation of the propagation of cylindrical waves (the field being independent of x) along the z direction in ducts described by $\\epsilon=c_{0}^{2}/c^{2}=\\epsilon_{0}-\\epsilon_{2}(z)y^{2}$ where c(y, z) is the wave velocity, c0 and ∊0 are constants, ∊2(z) is an arbitrary function of z, and e corresponds to the dielectric constant for electromagnetic waves. It has been shown that the intensity A02 of the wave is in general given by $A_{0}^{2}=[E_{0}^{2}/f(z)]F[y/y_{0}f(z)]$ where E0 is a constant, y0 is a constant, F is an arbitrary function of [y/y0f(z)], and f(z) is a dimensionless beam-width parameter given by $d^{2}f/dz^{2}=-[\\epsilon_{2}(z)/\\epsilon_{0}]f$ in the geometrical optics approximation. The nature of the variations of f with z has been discussed for some simple profiles of ∊2(z) in the geometrical optics approximation; diffraction has also been taken into account when the beam (F) is Gaussian."
"Atmospheric noise resulting from lightning discharges is modeled as a Poisson-related process that depends on two major physical factors; (a) the world distribution of thunderstorms and (b) the prevailing propagation conditions. In this work theoretical models of atmospheric noise have been developed by postulating physically motivated combinations of source distributions and propagation conditions. Then the noise statistics at the output of a narrow-band receiver for each combination are calculated. Particular noise statistics that are computed for several cases include the amplitude-probability distribution, the average envelope-level crossing rate, and the pulse-spacing distribution. The models postulated are found to be consistent with both experimental and prior theoretical results."
"Higher-order sine-cosine azimuth patterns for Adcock direction finding are investigated to determine spacing errors, reradiation errors, and pickup factor. The higher modes achieve wider apertures and reduced wave interference error; they exhibit comparable pickup factors but require an increase in the minimum number of antennas and different sensing methods. The 1.220λ spacing limit is appropriate only to the dipole mode, the corresponding limit for the quadrupole mode being 1.684λ and correspondingly greater for the higher modes. Reduced spacing error for the minimum number of antennas occurs at increasingly wider apertures which also tend to more closely approach the theoretical limits with increasing mode. The higher modes exhibit reduced response in the vicinity of the zenith. The resolution of the additional bearing ambiguities involves the use of one or more lower-order patterns. Predicted sense performance as a function of reradiated field amplitude is computed for a combination of quadrupole and dipole modes."
"A method is described to accomplish automatic data selection and profile inversion to obtain ionospheric electron-density profiles from digitized radio soundings. The profile inversion is based upon the well-established formulation of Paul [1960] by which the optimum radio-frequency sounding intervals can be specified from an approximate knowledge of the profile. The expected virtual height coordinates (h') at these frequencies (f) are likewise estimated, and procedures are then used to select h'(f) observations nearest the predicted coordinates from a subsequent digital ionogram. From these the next profile is obtained. The process adaptively follows the changing shape and detail of the profile. The procedure requires an average of 20 sec per profile on a standard data-processing computer and can be adapted, with benefit to on-line real-time use in our ‘dynasonde,’ digital ionosonde."
"The advent of the phase ionosonde, which gives more precise experimental data than the conventional instrument, has made it necessary to seek improvement in the technique of true-height reduction by reducing calculation errors. The method described here gives errors of approximately a few meters when the lowest observable frequency is 0.6 MHz and both magnetoionic modes are used."
"The technique of measuring ionosphere motion from the shift in the incoherent-scatter ion line has been known for some time. The underlying assumption in the adaptations of the technique applied so far is that there are no detectable current-induced asymmetries in the spectrum. In the auroral zone this assumption can be violated during magnetospheric storms. To cope with this possibility we use an estimate of the first moment of the spectrum together with a matched-filter-like estimate. The first moment is the sum of the first moment of the unshifted spectrum plus the Doppler shift. The matched-filter estimate, while not unaffected by asymmetries, tends to give an estimate closer to the Doppler shift. Hence, a difference between the two estimates is an indication of a current flowing in the range gate where the spectrum is measured. We assume that no other sources of asymmetry are present, although a large temperature gradient would have a similar effect. In principle the difference can be calibrated to give the magnitude of the current. This step is not yet completed owing to uncertainties in the composition of the ionosphere at low altitudes and a loss of frequency resolution due to the finite pulse length. The detectability of the currents by our method, however, is not affected by poor frequency resolution. Preliminary results from the Chatanika Auroral-Zone Incoherent-Scatter Radar are presented which show large velocities correlated in detail with simultaneous magnetometer data. Also an indication of a current flow has been observed in premidnight data taken on a very active night. An azimuth scan showed the sense of the current to be predominantly westward."
"A horizontal current-carrying wire near the surface of the earth will maintain a tangential electric field in the ionosphere overhead. The questions of how large this field must be to produce a given local increase in electron temperature in the D region and the corresponding required current (dipole moment) in the wire are addressed here. To achieve a 20 K modulation (about 10% of ambient temperature) of the local electron temperature at an altitude of 70 km under daytime conditions would require an rms current of 2730 amp at 45 Hz over a length of at least 300 km where the ground conductivity is 1.4 × 10−4 mho m−1. A parallel array of 23 wires spaced at 10-km intervals will produce the same temperature modulation with only 139 amp in each wire."

"Time- and frequency-domain statistics are presented for multipath propagation in a suburban mobile-radio environment for vehicle-travel distances on the order of 30 m. These statistics were obtained by measuring the quadrature components of the bandpass impulse response for the medium as a measuring vehicle was driven along the streets. For suburban residential and commercial areas on relatively flat terrain, the delay spread is generally less than 1/4μsec, and the correlation bandwidth at .9 correlation is greater than 250 kHz. Some extreme areas exhibit multiple-propagation paths with significant amplitudes at excess delays of 5 to 7 μsec (delay spreads of 2 μsec) and associated correlation bandwidths as low as 40 kHz."
"Numerical solutions of the continuity equation for electrons are obtained for the purpose of testing the vertical-drift effect on the plasma distributions in the equatorial F region of the earth's ionosphere. The results have shown that the altitude profile of electron density and the accompanied vertical-drift velocity measured at Jicamarca are consistent and confirmed that electromagnetic lifting is the major factor to cause the equatorial anomaly as suggested by Martyn [1955]. The calculated values are found to be in good agreement with the observations both in magnitudes and in distribution patterns."
"The day-to-day variability observed in the structure of the equatorial anomaly during a period of high solar activity is investigated. Using hourly values of f0F2 observed at a number of ionosonde locations in the American and Japanese longitude sectors during 1958, the structure of the equatorial F2 region has been obtained on an hourly basis for an entire year. It is observed that the equatorial anomaly shows considerable day-to-day fluctuations in both its structure and its diurnal development. The anomaly is generally best developed in the evening hours, and day-to-day changes in the time of best development are typically on the order of 2 to 4 hr. It is observed that the time when the anomaly attains its maximum development is not the same on both sides of the magnetic equator, although this time is closer to coincidence during the equinoctial months than during the solstices. Also during the equinoctial months, the anomaly crests tend to be more symmetric about the equator than during the solstices. The relative magnitudes of the crests display a noticeable changeover with time during the northern solstice in both longitude sectors. The crest on the winter side of the magnetic equator is larger during the day, and the summer crest is larger at night. The exact time that this changeover occurs varies on the order of 5 to 7 hr on a day-to-day basis. During the southern solstice this crest changeover is observed only in the Japanese sector."
"The fading characteristics of ionospheric amplitude scintillations can be described by a cumulative amplitude probability distribution function (cdf). The cdf expresses the probability (percentage of time) that the signal amplitude will equal or exceed a given amplitude. Distributions of amplitude variations are made with the use of ionospheric scintillations observed on beacon signals from synchronous satellites transmitting at 136 MHz. The resulting distributions are divided into six groups corresponding to ranges of the scintillation index, the predominant measure in scintillation studies. The model distributions are then combined with the occurrence of scintillations in various index ranges to produce cumulative amplitude probability distributions. These have been done for long-term observations made at Hamilton, Massachusetts, Narssarssuaq, Greenland, and Huancayo, Peru. The results allow engineers to determine margins necessary for communication and navigation systems. Individual 15-min distributions have been compared to the theoretical distributions obtained by Nakagami [1960] in his m-distribution method of characterizing amplitude scintillation and were found to be in good agreement. The m parameter is shown to be a measure of the frequency dependence of scintillations and can be used to determine a spectral index for interpolating the amplitude distributions to other frequencies of interest."
"This paper discusses the problem of remote probing and diagnostics of an inhomogeneous medium of which the properties vary only along a single dimension. The medium is described in terms of a set of unknowns that are determined via parameter optimization techniques such that the response of the trial medium agrees closely with that of the actual medium."
"We have derived tractable analytical results for a more complete understanding of the distortion of the amplitude, the pulse length, and the rate of frequency shift of an FM Gaussian pulse after it has undergone reflection from an ionospheric model with a linear electron-density profile and constant collision frequency."
"The input resistance of a short dipole antenna immersed in a warm magnetoplasma is calculated on the basis of the kinetic theory (Boltzmann equation). The plasma is uniaxial; i.e., the cyclotron frequency is much larger than the operating frequency of the antenna and the plasma frequency. The plasma is homogeneous, and collisions are included although the sheath is neglected. The dipole is assumed to be infinitesimally thin (producing an infinite input reactance) except for the case in which the dipole axis is parallel to the static magnetic field when we allow the dipole to have a nonzero radius and calculate the input impedance. It is found that at frequencies much less than the plasma frequency the input resistance differs markedly from the hydrodynamic and cold-plasma results because of collisionless absorption processes. The input resistance is generally smaller when the dipole axis is inside the resonance cone than when it is outside. The resonance cone anomaly in the input resistance is reduced in magnitude from that of the cold-plasma theory and is shifted to a higher frequency."
"The net-field polarization of a plane wave propagating in a magnetically biased cold plasma has been treated in a systematic fashion. Under quasi-longitudinal conditions the polarization transformations are particularly simple and as such have been treated in the literature. However, under more general conditions the polarization transformations are relatively complex. The axial ratio, tilt angle, rotation rate, and polarization sense all become functions of the initial conditions and the constants of the medium. Under quasi-longitudinal conditions the polarization ellipse rocks between two extremes, while the axial ratio also changes periodically between a minimum and a maximum value (Cotton-Mouton effect). The wide variety of polarization transformations available suggests the usefulness of slabs of magnetically biased plasma to synthesize microwave polarizers and depolarizers. The theory of net-field polarization when applied to data obtained during the 1968 solar occultation of Pioneer 6 verified that the usual quasi-longitudinal approximation (Faraday rotation) is adequate to describe S-band polarization in the solar corona."
"The linearized, continuum fluid-dynamical equations for a warm, collisional electron plasma with independent source terms are presented, and their applicability to boundary-value problems is discussed. Boundary conditions are developed for a perfectly conducting cylindrical antenna immersed in the warm collisional plasma and excited by a delta-function generator. An integral equation relating the antenna surface current and charge is derived based upon all the conventional boundary conditions and the requirement that proper continuity be maintained between the antenna and the plasma. The deficiency of other integral formulations, including the grid-type dipole, is discussed."
"The electric field at large distances from a moving test charge in a collisionless plasma is calculated. Significant differences from the well-known inverse fourth-power dependence of the electric field on the distance between the observer and the charged particle are obtained."
"Using WKB methods we have considered the propagation of electromagnetic waves in isotropic lossless media which vary slowly with both position and time. It is found that in such media the meaning of various quantities, such as the group velocity, must be reinterpreted. The theory is applied to study propagation in space-time, varying dielectrics, and plasmas."
"The solution of the inverse problem of electromagnetic scattering by smooth, convex-shaped and perfectly conducting scatterers is viewed and analysed following a system-synthesis approach. The formulation of the associated iterative averaging method is based on the fact that a knowledge of the variation of the scattered field's magnitude about the monostatic angle necessarily reflects some information on the curvature of the obstacle within the illuminated region. For the two-dimensional case this cognizance permits one to assume that for any smooth, slowly and uniformly varying, convex-shaped scatterer, an equivalent circular cylinder of identical curvature about the monostatic direction gives rise to an identical backscattered field magnitude. The method leads to the recovery of the equivalent electrical radii of curvature about the specular point which are in fair agreement with the exact values of elliptically cylindrical scatterers employed here for computational verification. This approach could be, therefore, useful in the portrayal of unknown scatterers, by curve fitting the various values of the electrical radii of curvature, obtained via the iterative averaging method as applied to data measured about the monostatic angle, for different directions of illumination with respect to the center of the scatterer. Although only the cases of circularly and elliptically cylindrical objects are examined here, it is anticipated that this technique is also applicable, in principle, for the portrayal of three-dimensional scatterers of convex, smooth shape, provided that high-frequency measurement data are available."

"The literature on the subject is reviewed under the headings: anisotropic (cold) electron plasma, isotropic (warm) electron plasma, loop antennas, resonance rectification, and ion effects. Though the gap between theory and experiment has narrowed for most of these topics, understanding is still unsatisfactory at lower frequencies where ion motion cannot be neglected."
"A feature of the session on the behavior of antennas in a plasma as a function of frequency of excitation was the variety of antenna configurations which was being investigated by various research groups."
"Ionograms recorded with ionospheric sounders aboard rockets and satellites show signals (resonances) which can persist from a fraction of a millisecond to many milliseconds after the termination of the transmitted pulse. Many of the characteristics of the resonances at the plasma frequency fN, the upper-hybrid frequency fT, the harmonic gyrofrequencies nfB, where n ≥ 2, and the maximum frequencies of the Bernstein modes fQn can be explained by propagating electrostatic waves. At frequencies near fN, fT, and nfB, electrostatic waves of slightly different frequencies generated by the transmitted pulse propagate in the ionospheric plasma, become reflected at distances up to several hundred meters away from the satellite, and return to the satellite, producing a continuous receiver response following the transmitted pulse. The resonance observed at the gyrofrequency fB is not yet understood. Nonlinear properties of the receiving system and/or the plasma can result in resonances observed at the sum and difference frequencies of the principal resonances. Other resoncance phenomena are also discussed."
"In summarizing the discussions, the following statements appeared well established: At the plasma frequency, fN. The waves responsible for resonance signals are electrostatic character. Their propagation vector k is directed nearly parallel to the magnetic field. These waves with frequency slightly greater than the plasma frequency do not exist in cold plasma theory, while in kinetic theory they appear inside the resonance cone."
"Three papers were presented in this session, two on plasma resonances and one about Bernstein-mode electrostatic waves."
"Although there is still only an incomplete understanding of plasma turbulence, knowledge has increased rapidly during the past few years. For weak turbulence, theory and experiment agree on the nature and strength of the interactions that occur. For strong turbulence, there is no general theory, but for some cases we have experimentally confirmed phenomenological laws which enable one to make quantitative estimates of the turbulent effects."
"R. J. Forrest (University College, London) examined the relation existing between various theories of helical propagation along a weakly ionized plasma column in an axial magnetic field. He showed that these particular theories are limiting cases of a general theory which includes both the effects of ion inertia and the influence of the magnetic field on the ions. The theory uses the first two fluid equations for the perturbed quantities of a warm plasma, i.e., the first two moments of the Boltzmann equation. For simplicity the model used is a planar one in which the perturbed densities and velocities for electrons and ions are introduced together with an electrostatic potential. This encompasses the gradient-driven ion acoustic and drift instabilities of an inhomogeneous plasma in a magnetic field. The model is extended by taking account of a harmonic perturbation in electron temperature and by including the third-moment equation; this leads to the instability associated with plasma-wave propogation."
"Recent observations of both naturally occurring and triggered VLF emissions (a few KHz) made on the ground, aboard rockets, and aboard satellites are discussed. Although reference is made to auroral-zone emissions, attention is concentrated on midlatitude discrete emissions such as chorus. Following Brice [1964] and Kennel and Petschek [1966], the signals are interpreted as arising from the transverse resonance (or cyclotron) instability of magnetospheric plasma in the equatorial plane in the vicinity of the plasmapause. The energy of the gyroresonant electrons is estimated; the precipitation of these energetic electrons from the radiation belts is a consequence of the interaction."
"In addition to a review on whistler mode propagation and VLF emissions, the introductory talk by M. J. Rycroft (University of Southampton, England) covered several recent topics, three of which were mostly discussed: (a) recent results of a ray tracing to be compared with Walter and Angerami's [1969] and Scarabucci's [1970] computations, (b) effect of thermal anisotropy on the real part of the refractive index, hence on raytracing, especially in plasmas with β = 1, (c) simultaneous rocket observation of electron flux (energies higher than 45 kev) and whistler-mode noise intensity."
"The excitation of plasma waves is reviewed, organized according to the mode of excitation: linear wave coupling, use of exciters (such as antennas and probes), particle-velocity anomalies (such as streams and loss cones) and wave-wave stimulation (such as three-wave and echoes)."
"Three short papers were read after the review paper by T. W. Johnston."
"A survey of wave-coupling phenomena is given. Different physical influences are discussed from a rather general plasma-wave equation displaying these influences. Nonlinear interaction is considered and some basic examples are given. Attention is called to certain physical points of view related to nonlinear analysis."
"W. R. Lorenz' review paper (printed in this issue) presented a systematic categorization of various linear and nonlinear coupling mechanisms encountered in the hydrodynamically approximated warm plasma. As on several occasions during this symposium, the range of validity of the fluid model was questioned; the discussion provided the usual answers of the adequacy of the model as long as the wave numbers of electron or ion waves involved in plasma processes are well below the Debye wave number kD. The utility of the fluid model, when adequate, was emphasized in connection with radiation and boundary value problems since the complexities introduced by kinetic theory tend to render much of the required analysis intractable. For better understanding of the influence of anisotropy, it was pointed out that substantial anisotropy in the particle velocity distribution may be accommodated by an anisotropic pressure tensor within the hydrodynamic description. In the special example of two-wave plasma interaction leading to radiation at 2ωp, as mentioned in the review, the effect of pressure anisotropy was shown to be negligible [Bessenrodt, 1969]. This aspect may be explained by noting that thermal quantities do not necessarily play a dominant role in wave coupling mechanisms; while perturbed velocity distributions are important with respect to the generation of primary plasma waves (e.g., in plasmas relevant to radio astronomy), certain interaction mechanisms among such waves may be explained approximately by assuming isotropic plasma conditions. Concerning reported observations of interaction and coupling in laboratory plasmas, attention was called to the need for distinguishing properly between coupling of different wave modes and intrinsic coupling of longitudinal and transverse constituents in a single mode, as noted at the beginning of the review paper."
"The instability of plane-parallel plasma streams with a nonuniform velocity profile, both in the absence and in the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field, has been investigated. The results for plasma streams are compared with those of ideal conductive liquid flows. Although for instability in a plane-parallel ideal-liquid flow the theorem of Rayleigh [1880] is valid, it is not so for plasma streams."
"Among the variety of problems arising from attenuating influences on the propagation of waves, three will be reviewed: (a) determination of the correct gas-kinetic description of collisions between the plasma particles and their relation to the conductivity tensor and the dispersion equation, (b) the generalization of the basic laws of geometric optics for moderate collisional absorption, and (c) the calculation of wave-mode attenuation arising from linearmode coupling in a full-wave theory for a cold, stratified, magnetized absorbing plasma."
"The last session with invited papers and contributions dealt with two topics: (a) attenuation and (b) two-stream instability. It also gave an occasion to include a few other contributions, which could not be presented during the preceding sessions."
"Some remaining contributions were read in a first part of this session. R. F. Benson (Goddard Space Flight Center, GSFC, Greenbelt, Md., USA) read two papers concerned with resonances observed in topside sounders. The first paper considered the small frequency shifts which are found for successive harmonics of the electron gyro frequency, fB. When the magnetic field is computed from observed frequencies, there is agreement with the result of the well-known computer programs (using Legendre development) for the sixth-order resonance. Higher orders give smaller values, and lower orders result in higher values of the effective field. Maximum deviation (up to 2%) has been found under the particular condition that the upper hybrid-resonance frequency fT = 2fB. There was another short contribution by M. Petit (Centre National d'Etude de Telecommunication, CNET, France) concerning the same subject."
"An analysis of the Mariner 6 and 7 occultation data has been completed. Final profiles of temperature, pressure, and electron density have been obtained for the Mariner 6 and 7 entry and exit cases, and results are presented for both the lower atmosphere and the ionosphere. The results of a detailed analysis of the systematic and formal errors introduced at each stage of the data reduction process are also included. At all four occultation points, the lapse rate of temperature was subadiabatic. up to altitudes in excess of 20 km. A pronounced temperature inversion was present above the surface at the Mariner 6 exit point. All four profiles exhibit a sharp, superadiabatic drop in temperature at high altitudes, with temperatures falling below the frost point of CO2. These results give a strong indication of frozen CO2 in the middle atmosphere of Mars. The analysis for the upper atmosphere indicates peak electron populations of 1.59 ± 0.2 × 105 cm−3 near 137 km and 1.73 ± 0.2 × 105 cm−3 near 138 km, at the Mariner 6 and 7 entry points, respectively. The plasma scale heights above these maxima were 43 ± 6 and 47 ± 4 km, corresponding to average topside temperatures of 388 ± 54 and 424 ± 35°K, for Mariner 6 and 7 entries, respectively."
"From simultaneous observations of vertical drift velocity and electron concentration near the dip equator, the photoionization and chemical loss rates for the electrons are deduced. At 300 km, q = 200 to 400 ion-pairs cm−3 sec−1, and β = 2 to 4 × 10−4 sec−1. The horizontal plasma transport term of the continuity equation is derived and compared with the corresponding vertical transport term. These terms dominate the electron concentration profiles above 500 km."
"Stable solutions of the ionospheric fields are derived by a modified matrix multiplication technique for a vertical geomagnetic field and large values of the local refractive index. In an alternate method one ignores the coupling between propagating and attenuated magnetoionic modes at large altitudes in the presence of a dipping geomagnetic field. These two methods are used to integrate fields above the F region and to compute propagation parameters of ELF and VLF waves. The propagation parameters of ELF fields are dependent on the altitude of the F region and on the geomagnetic field and may exhibit irregular frequency variations. In the VLF range the propagation parameters of terrestrial waves are adequately specified without including the effects of an F region. Application of the reciprocity theorem for a magnetoionic medium shows that an effective excitation of the terrestrial guide requires satellite sources of excessive dipole moments."
"In this paper, the amplitude distributions of the reflected radio waves, from various portions of the traveling ionospheric disturbances (TID) superimposed on small-scale irregularities, have been studied with the help of simultaneous records of amplitude and phase patterns of vertically reflected echoes. Amplitude distributions of reflected waves, related to different small portions of TID are found to exhibit different types of well-known distributions, like Rayleigh, Rice, and displaced Gaussian, while resultant distributions corresponding to two successive small portions of the TID may have different shapes, including the familiar M shape reported by many workers. Further, in some events, even three-peaked amplitude distributions are observed depending upon the ratio of steady component to random component present in the received echo and the nature of the reflecting surface."
"Linear relationships between daytime 30 MHz polar-cap absorption and the square root of integral and differential proton fluxes have been studied experimentally, using satellite and riometer measurements, and theoretically, by means of power-law model proton spectrums together with D-region ionization models developed previously by the author. Relationships of riometer absorption, A, to the 2π omnidirectional integral proton fluxes greater than the threshold energy E0 were found to be least sensitive to varying model proton spectrums for E0 = 7 Mev. In this case the following formula was computed: A = 0.083[J(>7 Mev)]1/2 db, where the flux units are cm−2sec−1. Using data collected from the 2π omnidirectional integral proton detectors on the polar-orbiting satellite 1963 38C with E0 = 2.2, 8.4, and 25 Mev on 93 passes and polar cap 30 MHz riometer data during three markedly different events, the best linear correlation was found to be A = 0.084[J(>8.4 Mev)]1/2 db with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.38 db. Daytime 30 MHz absorption during PCA's is affected most by 15 Mev protons, which produce their greatest ionization at a 65 km altitude in the D region."
"Rapid calculations of the dispersion relation can be made for a hot, Maxwellian electron magnetoplasma, with collisions and for any angle β between the wave normal and static magnetic field without using the low-temperature or the quasi-static approximations. The dispersion equations of Lewis and Keller [1962] are discussed and interpreted for the purpose of computer programming; these equations are valid for a Vlasov-Maxwellian plasma and contain a particle-preserving collision term. Examples of dispersion curves for homogeneous plane waves show: (1) protrusions from some refractive-index surfaces and (2) the usual multiplicity of solutions for a Maxwellian plasma when the real and imaginary components of the refractive index are of similar magnitude. For a wave frequency 1.11 times the plasma frequency and about 1.78 times the gyrofrequency, a minimum is found in the collisionless damping at β = 0° and a maximum is found at about β = 14°. Three alternatives for the gyroresonance observations on topside ionograms can be found from a study of the dispersion curves near the gyrofrequency: (1) an energy transfer between the highly damped whistler mode and electrons in the vicinity of the sounder, (2) the field resulting from the multiplicity of solutions mentioned above, and (3) an evanescent field."
"An approximate analytical method is presented for treating electromagnetic scattering from a slender cylindrical conductor buried in a homogeneous conducting half-space. The excitation is by a uniform line source of current located on the surface. The solution is achieved by an iterative method that accounts for the interaction of the induced current in the cylinder and the air-earth interface. It is shown that the cylindrical inhomogeneity will distort the profile of the subsurface magnetic field as the horizontal displacement is varied."
"A new method is described for determining the properties of arrays of parallel elements that are at least a wavelength long. This is a first step in a study of the behavior of arrays when the elements are driven by pulsed instead of steady-state voltages. The new solution for the distributions of current in and driving-point admittances of the coupled elements makes use of a method of successive approximations in which the boundary condition on the tangential electric field is satisfied separately for the induced and the driven current. The procedure begins with the known solution for an isolated, electrically long antenna and modifies this to take account of the mutual interaction. Graphs of the currents in electrically long two- and three-element arrays are shown, and driving-point admittances are given."
"A solution is developed to calculate the electric field intensity at one point in space due to an electric dipole at another point in space, subject to boundary conditions on a surface of revolution. The solution is valid both external and internal to the surface. Hence, it may be used to compute not only radiated and scattered fields, but also fields internal to resonant cavities. The current on the surface is obtained as an intermediary step. The solution is effected by the method of moments applied to the potential integral equation, and involves inversion of a generalized impedance matrix. The principal limitations to the solution are due to the matrix computation and inversion, which requires that the generating contour be at most several wavelengths long. Some examples of computations for spheres, disks, and conespheres are given."
"An earlier experimental result of potential importance to D-region chemistry and based on the effect of the earth's albedo is being reexamined and reconfirmed by presenting more detailed technical information on the airborne techniques employed. The interpretation of the observations, which consisted of radio soundings, suggests that the energy flux of viable light, distinct from the UV and X-ray range, has a profound effect on the electron density of the D layer."

"The photochemistry and transport of minor neutral constituents in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere are reviewed. The assumptions and inherent weaknesses of current theoretical models are discussed in detail. A better theoretical description of turbulent transport processes is needed for future models. The effects of planetary-scale circulation systems on minor constituents should be investigated. Quenching of N(2D) by O2 is the most likely source of the large NO concentrations present in the mesosphere, though laboratory studies are needed to determine the actual sources of N(2D) under thermospheric conditions. Recent mass spectrometric measurements of the ratio [O]/[O2] at 120 km calls for considerable rethinking on the oxygen problem. A critical review of theoretical models of a hydrogen/oxygen atmosphere is given and problems associated with boundary conditions are pointed out in various models. The need for more measurements of hydrogen constituents is emphasized."
"Calculations have been made of the diurnal variations in minor neutral constituents in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere for the condition of 60° latitude, summer and winter, using the method developed by the authors [Shimazaki and Laird, 1970]. The excited molecular oxygen O2(1Δg) has been added and the effects of absorption of Schumann-Runge bands have been taken into account. The results show significant seasonal differences, which may be interpreted mainly in terms of the difference of penetration of solar radiation and the duration of sunlit hours. However, the comparison of the observed seasonal and diurnal variations in the airglow emissions from hydroxyl, atomic oxygen (5577 Å), and O2(1Δg) with those calculated from models suggests that effects of large-scale meridional circulation (horizontal and vertical transports) may be important in explaining these observations. It is shown that the concentration of the constituents whose main loss mechanism is recombination with atomic oxygen decreases sharply above ∼80 km. These constituents include OH, HO2, H2O2, and NO2 (nighttime) and the extension of this general theory may explain the sudden decrease observed by rockets in the water-cluster ion concentration above ∼80 km. Ion-neutral chemistry should be important in explaining an observed increase in [NO] above ∼85 km."
"Measurements of ozone from rocket observations of the 1.27μ band are reviewed. The technique of using ground-based measurements to infer altitude profiles of the 1.27μ emission at twilight is illustrated. A comparison of altitude distributions derived from ground-based twilight observations with direct rocket measurements of the distributions demonstrates that ground-based observations provide a practical method to monitor the twilight altitude distribution of O2(1Δg). These O2(1Δg) altitude distributions can be easily converted into ozone distributions. A two-layer structure is present in the altitude distribution during most months of the year, but may be absent in midsummer. An observation on January 16, 1971, indicated that midsummer conditions may occur during a stratospheric warming. Preliminary observations indicate a strong seasonal variation of the upper ozone layer at 85 km with peak concentrations in excess of 1.3 × 108/cm3 in midwinter and less than 0.3 × 108/cm3 in midsummer."
"The recent discovery of relatively large concentrations of O2(1Δg) in the upper atmosphere had led to consideration of photoionization of this metastable molecule as a major source of O2+ in the D region. Our initial calculations indicated that this process was less important than previously believed, primarily because of CO2 absorption. In this paper we consider further the effect of various reasonable O2, CO2, and O2(1Δg) density profiles on the ion-production rates by this process. Within the limits described herein the ion-production rate (ion cm−3 sec−1) is approximated by the following function of NO2, the O2 column density in molecules per square-centimeter column, and n1Δ, the O2(1Δg) density in molecules per cubic centimeter:$P(O_{2})=n_{1\\Delta}[0.549\\times10^{-9}\\exp(-2.406\\times10^{-20}No_{2})+2.614\\times10^{-9}\\exp(-8.508\\times10^{-20}No_{2})]$"
"Electron production rates due to photoionization, qs(χ, h), and particle precipitation, qP(h), have been calculated for the midlatitude ionosphere from 70 to 140 km for conditions typical of solar minimum and maximum years. A simple model in which E and D regions are defined by Lyman β, EUV (30–120 A), Lyman α, and X rays (2–10 A) is used. An atmospheric model having annual variations for the major constituents and a seasonally constant profile of nitric oxide is also incorporated in the calculations. Electron density profiles have been derived using recent estimates of αeff. Results of calculations are shown for solar zenith angles χ = 37° and 72°, typical of noon values for summer and winter seasons. Fluxes of precipitated electrons typical of geomagnetic midlatitudes (L = 2.5–3.5) are used. For both solar minimum and maximum years, the seasonal variations in qt(h) and Nt(h) differ significantly from those of a Chapman layer, partly because production rates from 80 to 100 km due to particle precipitation are from 25 to 90% of the total. One aspect of the ‘heavily ionized’ winter lower ionosphere is discussed. Calculated diurnal variations in ionization for conditions typical of solar maximum years at higher latitudes (L = 3.5–4.0) also reveal irregular variations with x due to the particle precipitation contribution."
"The intensity range of precipitating electrons with E > 40 kev determined from a previous review of satellite and rocket data by the authors is used to compute the latitude variation of the 3914-A and 4278-A intensities of the first negative system of N2+. The range of computed airglow intensities encompasses the values observed at Saskatoon, Silver Spring, and Kitt Peak located at geomagnetic latitudes of 60°, 50°, and 40°, respectively. Therefore, these >40 kev electrons, which are a potentially significant source of ionization in the nighttime D region, also provide a sufficient energy input to the ionosphere to account for these nightglow observations."
"The contribution of cosmic X rays in the production of ionization in the nighttime D region is discussed in the light of observed X-ray flux emissions from the various celestial X-ray sources and from the galactic background. The cumulative effect of several sources when they are in transit at close time intervals can amount to a sizable fraction of all nighttime sources, which consist principally of scattered Ly α and Ly β. Above 95 km, the Ly β contribution is generally far in excess of the production due to cosmic X rays, but, at and around 90 km, the relative importances of cosmic X rays and scattered Ly α depend on the variation of the scattered Ly α flux, its variations with time, the nighttime concentrations of nitric oxide, and on the variations in the flux from the sources. Since some of these are uncertain, exact contributions are difficult to establish, but a marginal ionospheric effect around 90 km levels from cosmic X-ray sources seems possible at low latitudes."
"A comparison of ion-molecule reaction rates implied by E- and F-region chemistry and measured in the laboratory shows on the whole good agreement except that the ionospheric analysis demands stronger temperature dependences. In the daytime D region, it is claimed that the reconciliation of positive ion densities with production rates and laboratory rate constants would best be achieved if (1) ionization of O2(1Δg) and hydration of O4+ in competition with the reduction of O4+ to O4+ by O2+ were the dominant source of hydrates between 85 and 77 km, (2) ionization of NO by solar Lyman α followed by hydration was the dominant source of hydrates below 77 km, and (3) for some reason, Lyman α did not ionize NO effectively at pressures below those prevailing at 75 km. A discussion of large auroral NO densities will emphasize difficulties in accepting them but will offer no explanation for their observation."
"The results of two experiments designed to measure the concentration (and, in one case, the relevant mobilities) of charged particles of both signs in the mesosphere region are presented. In the mobility experiments two groups of positively charged particles were found in the height region 58 to 72 km. The heavy group was about four times less, the light group about eight times more mobile than the extrapolated mobility of light ions measured on the ground. The mobility of the negative particles was about equal to the mobility of the light group of positive carriers. It was therefore concluded that the negative ions and the ‘light’ positive carriers were molecule ions, whereas the heavy, positively charged group belonged to heavier, aerosol particles. The second experiment, a modified Langmuir probe arrangement, was designed to determine the critical height above which the probe current is predominantly caused by free electrons. This height was found to be around 62–63 km. In both experiments a considerable increase of ionization was found below 50 km, whereas two other flights with the modified Langmuir probe did not show this additional layer. It was found that both the mobility experiment and the Langmuir experiment were flown about half an hour after an SID, whereas the other two Langmuir experiments were flown under normal conditions. It is suspected that the observed additional ionization was generated in connection with the SID events by either wave or particle radiation."
"An Areas rocket-parachute system was used at night to compare supersonic and subsonic ionization measurements below 75 km. A hemispherical nose-tip probe was used on ascent and a parachute-borne blunt probe on descent to measure polar conductivities, which were due entirely to positive and negative ions. The velocity of the supersonic probe was ∼Mach 2.5 at 50 km and 1.75 at 70 km; the blunt probe was subsonic below 71 km. Between 65 and 75 km the ratio of negative to positive conductivities (and thus of mobilities) determined by the blunt probe was about 1.2, and it approached 1 below this altitude range. The ratio obtained by the nose-tip probe varied from 1.5 at 75 km to 6 at 65 km, thus indicating a rapid variation of the effects of the shock wave on the sampled ions. The absolute values of positive conductivity measured subsonically and supersonically were essentially identical from 60 to 75 km, indicating that the sampled ions were unchanged by the shock. However, below 60 km the shock apparently ‘broke up’ the positive ions, as indicated by higher measured conductivities. The negative ion conductivities for the supersonic case indicated that the sampling was badly disturbed by the shock. The negative ions were apparently lighter (higher mobility) than those sampled subsonically above 72 km and below 50 km. However, they appeared heavier (lower mobility) at the intervening altitudes."
"The results of four positive-ion mass-spectrometer experiments in the lower ionosphere are reported. The data were obtained at high latitudes under different ionospheric conditions. The presentation is concentrated on the C2+, NO+, and water-cluster ions. Possible effects of different primary-ion production and of low temperatures on the ion population are discussed in terms of current reaction schemes."
"Positive ion mass spectrometer observations of the auroral zone ionosphere above Fort Churchill and the midlatitude ionosphere above White Sands are reviewed. The auroral zone ionosphere, either day or night, resembles the midlatitude daytime ionosphere. Decay of the ionosphere at sunset and into the night is seen from measurements made above White Sands. The midlatitude nighttime ionosphere in the E region is sustained at an ion density of about 103 ions/cm3 by resonantly scattered ionizing solar radiation. Sporadic-E events are seen as concentration of metallic atomic ions, primarily of Mg+ and Fe+."
"This paper reviews the use of the incoherent scatter radar technique for studies of the E-region ion concentration and composition. A number of existing incoherent scatter radars are capable of securing profiles of ion concentration in the E region with a height resolution of 1 or 2 km by integrating the signals for several minutes. The advantage of these measurements is the ease with which a continuous time history may be secured. The height resolution is probably open to improvement by using coded pulses, but this remains to be attempted. The technique is of less value in studying the ion composition; and to date, only the relative abundance of atomic (O+) to molecular (principally NO+ and O2+) ions has been deduced from incoherent-scatter measurements. Even here it has usually been necessary to adopt a model for the ion temperature as a function of altitude. Nevertheless, these composition measurements clearly show a seasonal variation of the O/N2 ratio in the thermosphere which is believed to be responsible for the seasonal anomaly in F-region density. Recently, the accuracy of the measurements and the data reduction procedures have been improved to the point where the relative ion abundance can be determined over the altitude interval 120–200 km, given only that this be a continuous smooth function."
"Results are presented for recent measurements of reaction rates using the NOAA flowing afterglow systems. These include the O2+−H2O reaction sequence, the hydration of NO+, and new measurements of charge exchange and ion-atom interchange for E-region ions."
"Rate constants for room-temperature reactions involving atmospheric cluster ions have been measured using two laboratory facilities: (1) a stationary afterglow facility employing photoionization and separate mass analysis for ions and neutrals, and (2) a drift tube facility employing thermionic emission of alkali ions and mass analysis of ions. In the afterglow facility, the sequence of reactions initiated by NO+ ions reacting in a gaseous mixture of nitric oxide and water vapor and terminated by H3O+·4H2O has been studied at 296°K with each rate constant measured independently. Likewise the sequence of reactions initiated by NO+ ions reacting in a gaseous mixture of nitric oxide and ammonia and terminated by NH4·3NH3 has been studied at 296°K. In the drift tube facility, the clustering of atmospheric gases to the alkali ions Li+, Na+, and K+ has been studied. From laboratory studies of the clustering of atmospheric gases to alkali ions, a map of the minimum values for initial clustering reaction rate constants and equilibrium constants has been drawn. The importance of the formation of a weakly bound cluster ion followed by a switching reaction to form a strongly bound cluster ion to the ion chemistry of the D region has been shown."
"We present experimental results from a partial simulation of the disturbed nighttime ionosphere at 300°K. N2:O2 mixtures at pressures from 0.1 to 30 torr are contained in a 700-liter chamber and irradiated by a diffuse beam of megavolt electrons. In dry gas, only the ions O2–, O2+, and NO+ are seen with the mass spectrometer at the onset of irradiation. As the electron bombardment continues, these ions interact with beam-generated neutral species to produce a spectrum eventually dominated by NO+, NO2−, and NO3–. From measurements of O2+ production and loss rates as a function of irradiation time, the dominant NO production mechanism is shown to be O2+ + N2 → NO+ + NO with a rate constant ≤1 × 10−16 cm3/sec, followed by ionic recombination to neutralize the NO+. We measure the following thermal-energy two-body ionic recombination coefficients, in units of 10−8 cm3/sec: α(NO+, NO−3) = (3.4 ± 1.2); α(NO+, NO−2) = (17.5 ± 6.0); and α(O2+, O2−) ≤ (14 ± 5). With water added to the gas, the sequence H3O+(H2O)n (n — 0, 1, 2, 3) becomes important in the positive-ion spectrum."
"The ionization changes that occur during solar X-ray (SXR) flares have been used to study electron loss rates at low altitudes in the D region. The electron production from SXR radiation was calculated from fluxes obtained by SOLRAD 9, and the changes in the ionization densities were measured by the partial-reflection technique. Effective loss rates were determined at various heights during the SXR flare effect and for several sizes of flares at different times of the year. The rate values obtained were lower than those reported by Reid [1970], and are interpreted as resulting from a destruction of large water cluster ions during the initial stages of the SXR flare effect. These cluster ions have fairly large effective loss rates, and their disappearance would result in a reduced effective loss rate."
"The paper surveys the available information on the D- and E-region electron density profile. The behavior of the E-layer peak in time and space is fairly well mapped from ionosonde measurements. Our knowledge of the ionization distribution below the maximum of the E layer comes from a limited number of rocket flights through the lower ionosphere and from extended time series of observations by ground-based radio methods from a few stations. From such measurements a very sketchy and imperfect picture emerges of the electron density profile in the quiet and disturbed lower ionosphere and its geographical, diurnal, seasonal, and sunspot cycle variation."
"At Millstone Hill it is difficult to make incoherent scatter measurements of the electron density in the ionosphere at altitudes below 160 km because of the presence of interfering ground-clutter echoes. Modifications have been made to the zenith-pointing 220-foot antenna to reduce the energy radiated at low angles, and as a result the ground-clutter echoes now do not normally exceed the dynamic range of the receiver. Accordingly, it is possible to filter the clutter echoes from the ionospheric echoes on the basis of their narrow spectrum. Employing this approach, we have been able to measure electron densities in the E and D regions down to an altitude of 75 to 80 km. In the measurements made so far, a 3-km-height resolution has been employed and the results clearly indicate the presence of sporadic E layers and other features regularly seen on rocket flights. Echoes appear to be obtained at altitudes below 80 km that are too strong to be caused by free electrons, and it may be that these echoes result from imperfect cancellation of clutter returns or from turbulent irregularities in the neutral atmosphere."
"Synoptic studies of the D-region electron densities using the differential-absorption partial-reflection experiment at 2.66 and 6.275 MHz are in progress at Ottawa (45°N, 76°W). The measurements are made from about one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset throughout the winter and for 10 consecutive days each month during the other seasons. The methods employed to analyze data obtained over long periods are outlined in this paper and average electron densities showing diurnal behavior under quiet conditions are presented. Over the greater part of the day (i.e., for solar zenith angles less than about 75°) the electron number densities show regular solar control with values increasing toward local noon. However, there is an asymmetry about local noon of up to 6° in solar zenith angle, the morning electron densities being lower than those at the corresponding time in the afternoon. The diurnal changes for solar zenith angles greater than 75° are more complicated. The formation over dawn of a C layer at heights below 75 km can be observed, and there is evidence that this layer decays after a solar zenith angle of about 90°. This decay continues until arrested by photoionization processes."
"A coordinated rocket program to study winter variability in D-region ionization was conducted at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, during the winter of 1970–1971. Parachute-borne blunt probes that measure positive-ion and electron conductivities were flown, in conjunction with other experiments, on January 22 and 26 and February 1, 1971. Both A1 and A3 radiowave absorption techniques were used to indicate anomalous winter days. The two rocket shots in January occurred on such days of high absorption. The first of these was one of quiet solar activity, whereas the second was preceded by a major solar proton event on January 24. The third flight occurred on a normal winter day. Unusual meteorological conditions preceded January 22, but not January 26 and February 1. Although the enhancement in electron densities was about the same on the two anomalous days (the radiowave absorption relating primarily to electron densities above 80 km and the blunt probe showing an enhancement of about 2 to 3 over the control day below 80 km), the positive-ion measurements showed that they were in fact quite different in character. The positive ions in the range 50–60 km on January 26 were almost precisely the same as those on the control day. This indicates that there was no change in the ion production or loss processes and implies that the enhanced electron density was due to a chemical change (but possibly related to the preceding solar event) in the attachment-detachment balance. By contrast, on January 22 the positive ions showed a factor of 1.5 or more increase in the altitude range 50–60 km. The fact that this enhancement occurred at an altitude where the ionization is cosmic ray rather than solar controlled indicates that the enhancement was due to a decrease in the loss rate rather than an increase in production. We tentatively conclude that we have observed two days of ‘anomalous’ winter absorption of very different character, one possibly related to a solar disturbance, and one probably entirely induced by meteorological effects. The former day was probably characterized by inhibition of the formation of negative ions due to increased detachment and the latter by decreased ionization loss rate."
"Between December 1969 and March 1970, a total of 26 Skua 2 rockets were successfully launched close to local noon at Arenosillo, Spain. Using an ultralight chaff, the winds and chaff fall rates were determined at heights between 75 and 95 km. At the same time, A 3 absorption measurements were carried out on 2.83 MHz between Aranjuez (Madrid) and Arenosillo. From the wind and fall-rate measurements, a quantity has been derived for each kilometer height range, being roughly proportional to the air mass flow, that is wind vector over fall rate at the corresponding height levels. These flow vectors, which were obtained on different days at the different height levels, have been correlated with the noon absorption values L ∼ ∫N·v·dh taken from the short-wave propagation path between Arenosillo and Aranjuez. A significant, but not very high, correlation was found between the mass flow at 90 to 93 km and the absorption L, which increased with increasing flow from the NNE. At 85 km, L increased with increasing flow from the SSW. For the other heights between 75 and 95 km, a significant correlation could not be found, although there is some indication of a relationship at 77 km."
"Examination of meteorological synoptic analyses in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere and ƒmin values observed over North America reveals a significant correlation between the passage of a deep planetary wave and increased electron densities in the lower ionosphere. As evidence of this correlation, a series of synoptic analyses concentrated in the upper stratosphere, along with longitudinal cross section of zonal winds and temperatures, and profiles of fmin are illustrated. Correlation coefficients were calculated between mean daytime values of ƒmin and the zonal, meridional, and vertical components of the wind at 40 and 50 km. These calculations show, in general, that the correlation increases with altitude, decreases with an increase in latitude, and that the zonal wind in midlatitudes exhibits the highest correlation. Correlation coefficients between ƒmin in and planetary magnetic indices, solar sunspot number, and solar flux would point to exclusion of extraterrestrial parameters as a source of the observed electron increase."
"A transportable, 16-GHz solar telescope is now being used to investigate the atmospheric transmission of solar radiation, with special emphasis on the effects of precipitation. An equatorial mount and digital-clock drive direct the pointing angle of the antenna to follow the sun's path to within 0.05° of arc. A 40-inch offset paraboloid antenna with twin prime focus feeds is used. The dual feeds alternately sample (at a 1-KHz rate) the transmitted solar energy and the atmospheric emission, so that the detected difference signal is a direct measure of the atmospheric transmissivity. The superheterodyne, double-sideband receiver has an approximate overall noise temperature of 740°K and IF bandwidth of 225 MHz. Attenuations up to 35 db can be measured. The fast switching rate along with a high-speed data-acquisition system allow measurements with a time constant less than 0.1 sec. The transportability of the instrument permits studies of attenuation in various climatic regions."
"A procedure is given for deriving elevation-error and range-error correction equations in a form suitable for use in the rapid processing of satellite tracking data. The refractivity of the troposphere is assumed to have spherical symmetry, but may have any given profile that does not depart greatly from standard. When the procedure was tested for numerical accuracy by application to an exponential profile, the corrections calculated agreed with those obtained by ray tracing to 0.3% or better over a range of surface refractivity from 200 to 450 and a range of radiowave arrival angles from horizontal to vertical."
"Recordings of the relative phase and amplitude of the signal from GBR, Rugby, U.K., have been made for several years at Byrd Station, Antarctica. Diurnal variations and the behavior of the signal received on a loop and a vertical antenna are consistent with the hypothesis that the dominant signal arrives at Byrd over the short great circle path when it is in maximum darkness and over the long great circle path when it is in maximum darkness. This is to be expected for a path of this length (short path, 16,248 km; long path, 23,759 km) because the attenuation of VLF signals is very much less for dark than for sunlit conditions. The short and long paths from GBR to Byrd contain portions of the Antarctic ice cap about 1250 and 725 km long, respectively. Using reasonable assumptions about the attenuation over the non-ice-cap portions of the path, calculations were made of the excess attenuation introduced by the ice cap on the two paths when the ice cap is completely dark or illuminated, assuming that the inconsistencies in the signal level over the two paths were due to the additional attenuation over the ice cap. The results indicate that the excess attenuation rate over the sunlit ice cap is between 17 and 31 db/1000 km, which corresponds to a range of conductivities between 0.01 and 0.05 mmho/m for 16 kHz. The nighttime data indicated an attenuation rate of 17 to 22 db/1000 km, which is outside the range of calculated attenuation rate versus conductivity."
"The amplitude of ground backscatter at high frequency (HF) recorded with oblique sounding equipment that utilizes azimuthal antenna beamwidths of about 6° and effective pulse lengths of about 50 μsec is characterized by sharp spikes that rise 10 to 20 db above the diffuse background clutter and have a range extent as short as the pulse length. These spikes suggest that the backscattering efficiency of the ground is highly nonuniform as a result of the occasional presence of a localized surface feature with a backscatter cross section one or two orders of magnitude larger than any object in the surrounding countryside. When short-pulse ground backscatter echoes are displayed as intensity modulated range versus azimuth records, these sharp spikes produce discrete echoes with an azimuthal extent approximately equal to the effective beamwidth of the antenna. The sources of many of these discrete echoes have been identified with specific topographic and geographic features, including cities and mountains in the western United States and islands in the Caribbean Sea."
"The measurement of the vertical angle of arrival of HF skywave, multimode signals generally requires either highly complicated mathematical manipulations or observing techniques that necessitate a waiting period until the relative phases among the modes either reach a desired condition or pass through a desired range of variations. This paper utilizes an extenson of a very old method (the Prony method, c. 1795) for approximating sums of exponential functions. The technique uses relatively simple calculations that are based on an instantaneous (or nearly so) set of samples from a uniformly spaced, vertically disposed array of antenna elements. Unlike many other methods, this technique requires neither time variations of phase nor a perfectly reflecting ground plane, and is valid for arbitrary polarization of the (similar) antenna elements and for any general wave polarization. Experimental results from some field tests of the process for vertical angle estimation are presented."
"DF interferometry on an FM/CW sounder has been successfully performed using a three-element crossed baseline array and twin channel receiver modified for linear FM synthesis. Measured baseline phase differences obtained from a sum-and-difference CRT phase display were used to compute incident azimuth and elevation. Phase ambiguities were resolved by prior knowledge of the sounder location. Measurements in San Antonio, Texas, on cooperative FM/CW targets in Pueblo and Boulder, Colorado, showed essentially constant azimuth within ±2°, commensurate with ionospheric lateral deviation effects. Corresponding elevation data showed increasing elevation angle with frequency indicative of increasing ray penetration. The azimuth/elevation measurements were made without benefit of IF spectral analysis for time-delay-mode resolution. Consequently, measurements were successful over those frequency ranges at which the sounder signal dominated interfering stations. This limitation would be eliminated by the use of cross-spectrum analysis at the receiver output."
"Numerical and analytic solutions in the ray-optics region have been obtained for the scattering of HF radio waves by a spherical electron cloud with a Gaussian distribution of electron density in the radial direction. The results show that a highly overdense or hard cloud has a wide range of backscatter angles for which the cross section is almost constant with a value close to that of an equivalent conducting sphere (critical radius size). A slightly overdense or soft sphere has a much narrower range of almost constant cross section whose value is proportional to the fourth power of the critical radius and considerably below that of an equivalent conducting sphere. In the region of forward scatter, all spheres have essentially the same cross section, independent of hardness. For underdense spheres, the cross section is generally the same as that characteristic of forward scattering except in the region of maximum deflection where the cross section increases very sharply. It is found that when an underdense sphere becomes critical, the maximum deflection is 90°, whereas an overdense sphere retains its maximum deflection of 180° at the critical density. For overdense spheres, the analytic results are in good agreement with those obtained numerically; but for underdense spheres, they are not in good agreement at the higher electron densities."
"The field-strength dependence of the damping coefficient of whistlers is studied in the geometrical optics approximation in the two limiting cases: (1) weak collisions where (ω — ω2)2 » v2 (ω, ω2)2 and v being the wave, electron cyclotron, and electron-neutral collision frequencies, respectively) but with no restriction on the nonlinearity parameter; (2) strong collisions where v2 » (ω — ω2)2 and the nonlinearity parameter is very high. The nonlinear effects are found to be very important at low frequencies as well as at frequencies near the electron cyclotron frequency."
"Orthogonality conditions satisfied by the height gain functions governing VLF fields in the vertically inhomogeneous, anisotropic earth ionosphere waveguide are discussed. It is pointed out that these orthogonality conditions which in general involve both the height gains for the given waveguide and those of an appropriate ‘adjoint’ waveguide can serve as a sensitive test for numerical consistency in full wave calculations of waveguide parameters."
"Continuous measurements of electron temperatures, electron concentrations, and vertical plasma drift were made at Jicamarca during the September 11, 1969, solar eclipse. Control measurements were made on September 13, 1969. Synthesis of the observed electron concentrations was made, using a model that solved the time-dependent electron-ion continuity equations. Ions O+, NO+, O2+, and N2+ were treated. Physical and chemical processes pertinent to the F region were considered in a realistic way. At noon, 300 km above Jicamarca, we obtained the values q = 290 cm−3 sec−1 for the O+ production rate, β = 1.94 × 10−4 sec−1 for the loss coefficient, and H = 59 km for the atomic oxygen scale height. All large-scale features observed in the F2 region were synthesized by the model. This synthesis was not sensitive to a simultaneous 30% reduction of q and β"
"A theory is developed to describe scattering from irregularities in a magneto-ionic medium. The theory makes use of the asymptotic Green's dyadic. Since the medium is anisotropic, cross-mode scattering in addition to self-mode scattering is possible. Several examples are given."
"A radio-frequency sheath model for a spherical probe in a collisionless plasma is presented. The method of solution is based on the quasi-static approximation and the electrostatic probe theory of Bernstein and Rabinowitz. The resistive part of the admittance is ascribed to the sheath transit-time collisionless dissipation mechanism suggested by Mayer and developed by Gould. Expressions are obtained for the effective sheath thickness and the equivalent resistance of the transit-time dissipation. The sheath model and, hence, the admittance are completely determined in terms of the bias potential, the probe radius, the plasma frequency, and the Debye length; i.e., there are no adjustable parameters in our theory which are to be determined by experiment. Our results agree favorably with Cohen and Bekefi's experimental data on the conductance resonant frequency and the width of the conductance peak."
"A theory is given describing the conversion of obliquely incident fast waves to slow waves when propagation is perpendicular to a static magnetic field in a warm inhomogeneous plasma for frequencies near and below the second electron cyclotron harmonic. The half-space and thin slab are treated with collisional effects included. The results are compared with those of a previously considered normally incident wave case. In particular, the analysis points out that wave conversion is proportional to the scale length of the density gradient at a hybrid resonance point provided the scale length is small compared to a free space wavelength. Both analytical and numerical solutions for the reflection and transmission coefficients and fields within the slab are presented. Between the hybrid resonances the electric field is found to consist of a longitudinal Bernstein mode contribution with rapid spatial variation and a slow variation extraordinary mode contribution. With appreciable losses, a pure standing wave is predicted at the center of the plasma whereas near the hybrid resonance points the longitudinal field is predominantly a traveling wave with an outwardly directed phase velocity. Although the coupling is small, the longitudinal field attains a large amplitude producing strong reflection of the incident wave when resonances occur with even symmetry about the center of the slab. Furthermore, the numerical computations indicate a perturbation in the position of the resonances from those of the normally incident case. This shift is analogous to the azimuthally asymmetric modes of a plasma column. Finally, for a large angle of incidence, the formulation leads to the impedance of a nonuniform plasma capacitor in a magnetic field."
"The electromagnetic energy transmitted over a path in which a thin, dispersive, dielectric medium is introduced is studied from the viewpoint of maximizing the transmitted energy. Two cases are treated in detail: a dispersionless dielectric and a plasma dielectric, including the effects of collisions. It is shown that the form of the solution that maximizes the energy transmitted through a dispersionless dielectric minimizes the energy transmitted through a plasma dielectric. Expressions specifying the energy transferred in each case are presented. The cases treated illustrate the importance of dispersion in choosing a suitable pulse shape for maximum energy transmission."
"Scattering of electromagnetic waves by arbitrary objects moving in free space is discussed. The objects move at constant velocities. The formalism is relativistically exact and applies to arbitrary distances from the scatterer. The results are recast in terms of the dominant (far-field) frequency; this is useful for low velocities and near-field frequencies. Numerical results are given for scattering by two-dimensional moving monopoles and dipoles."
"The analysis for the radiation pattern of an infinitesimal dipole mounted on the tip of a perfectly conducting, finite length cone is presented. The pattern is constructed from the superposition of a wave radiated directly from the linear element (in the presence of an infinite cone) and a wave diffracted from the edge of the cone. The method is verified by comparing computed values with experimental data."
"Most theoretical treatments of single-surface scatter indicate negligible depolarized scatter into the plane of incidence. However, experimental measurements show that this scatter component is present. Several investigators have attempted to develop an explanation for the contradiction by attributing the depolarization to multiple scatter on the surface, but there is also evidence that the depolarization arises from volume scatter beneath the surface. In the Reneau et al. [1967, p. 463] measurements of laser scatter from inhomogeneous dielectrics they found, “… strong evidence that the depolarization process occurs primarily within the volume.” In similar studies Leader [1970, p. 11] also found, “The depolarized component is many orders of magnitude less than the polarized component when there is little contribution from the volume of the sample.” This paper presents a development for backscatter from rough surfaces, based on the single-surface Kirchhoff method as employed by Fung [1967], which incorporates components due to volume scatter from the subsurface. The resulting expression contains a depolarized backscatter component due exclusively to the volume scatter. Calculation of polarized and depolarized backscatter and depolarization ratios are shown for several values of dielectric constants and volume reflection coefficients."
"An attempt has been made in this work to perform an appraisal of the degree to which fixed-frequency amplitude versus time-delay simulations can be made to agree in detail with actual HF-radar ground-back-scatter observations taken with azimuthally broad beam antennas. The physical constraints and effects of propagation phenomena such as the spatial distribution of the ionospheric electron density, D-layer absorption, the antenna pattern, rough-surface scattering of the surface of the earth, and cross-polarization losses are discussed. A composite backscatter-simulation method, based upon a weighted sum of individual simulations (separate raytraces and backscatter simulations) from different electron density distributions, is used to account for downrange geographical variation in electron density profiles, and the multiplicity of propagation modes which may occur during conditions of nonblanketing sporadic-E or spread-F ionization. Tabular descriptions of electron density versus height, from actual ionospheric soundings, are used instead of ionospheric models. Both isotropic and anisotropic scattering models are used. Order of magnitude estimates are given for the radar cross section per unit area ($\\tilde{\\sigma}^{0}$) of land illuminated by one-hop 16-MHz radiation westward from Washington, D. C."
"A mode-conversion program has been developed which allows for the vertical inhomogeneity of the ionosphere as well as its anisotropy. As an illustration of the potential use of the program for diagnostic studies at VLF, the sunrise amplitude study of Walker [1965] is numerically modelled with allowance for four modes. Exponential profiles of varying reference height and scale height are used to simulate the terminator. Of the models studied, best agreement is obtained with a terminator thickness of 1000 km. Despite the multimode nature of the models, Crombie's [1964] model is found to be valid for the path studied. This is because of weak conversion from the third and fourth nighttime modes to the first daytime mode."
"A high-resolution, frequency-modulated, continuous-wave (FMCW), oblique-incidence sounder was used to measure the minimum equivalent pulse widths that could be transmitted over two different oblique paths. One path, 1880 km long, was substantially an east-west path from Lubbock, Texas, to Stanford, California. The second path, 1300 km long, from Bozeman, Montana, to Stanford had characteristics representative of north-south propagation. The data from each path indicated that for 50% of the daylight hours, pulse widths as small as 3 to 5 μsec could be transmitted without significant ionospheric broadening if the minimum dispersion frequency was used."
"Starting with the plane-wave solution for scattering from a two-layer sphere, the quasistatic response of a thin conducting shell is recovered analytically. Responses are also computed for shells of arbitrary thickness, and the range of validity of the thin-shell approximation is determined. These results are extended to the time domain by a numerical inverse Fourier transform which yields the response to a step-function incident field (magnetic or electric). It is found that under the thin-shell approximation, the transient response has a simple single-exponential form. This is modified to some extent when the arbitrary thickness of the shell is allowed for."
"The significance of the electric and magnetic polarizability tensors in low frequency scattering is emphasized. In the particular case of perfectly conducting, rotationally symmetric bodies with plane-wave illumination, it is shown how the entire Rayleigh-scattered field can be expressed in terms of just three tensor elements, functions only of the geometry of the body. Inequalities satisfied by these elements are used to establish optimum lower bounds on the scattering cross sections, and, in addition, the elements themselves are examined analytically and computationally for a variety of shapes. Some of the implications of these results are discussed."
"In a recent paper, Senior and Uslenghi [1971] further developed the radar cross section of a finite cone. For the axial radar cross section, they evaluated the fields on the axial caustic using the first- and second-order solution of Keller [I960]. It is the intent of this paper to show that the equivalent-current method of Ryan and Peters [1969, 1970] yields the same results as those of Senior and Uslenghi. The equivalent-current technique is, however, a more straightforward procedure to implement for the treatment of the scattered fields in the vicinity of the caustic and should be included in the collection of diffraction solutions. The equivalent-current technique is required only in the vicinity of the axial caustic. The results merge with the more conventional procedures as the observation point moves away from the axial caustic region. Thus, the numerical results discussed in this paper are concerned with the axial backscattered fields. In our development, the second-order diffracted ray across the base of the cone includes a factor of one-half not included in the Senior-Uslenghi solution. The reason for this factor is discussed in detail. The solution to a simpler wedge problem with and without this factor is compared to an integral equation solution in the Appendix. The experimental and theoretical results for the cone differ consistently by approximately 2 db for a wide range of cone-base radii and indicate that an additional mechanism contributes significantly to the scattered fields. One is suggested and indeed is required in the similar wedge solution of the Appendix. The equivalent-current technique is seen to be applicable to cones which have base radii as small as 0.3λ."
"A relativistically exact formulation is presented for multiple scattering of electromagnetic waves by arbitrary, uniformly moving objects. The formulation is based both on spectral representations which are easily transformed from one frame of reference into another and on a successive scattering scheme which iteratively satisfies the boundary conditions on the surface of the obstacles. Explicit expressions and computational results are given for scattering by two thin dielectric cylinders."
"Radiation from a flanged parallel-plate waveguide is studied analytically using the Weber-Schafheitlin discontinuity integral when the waveguide is excited by TE-mode waves, TM-mode waves, or an electromagnetic line source. Electromagnetic fields are represented by the discontinuity integral in the exterior space, and in the waveguide region they are expanded by normal modes of the waveguide. Imposing the boundary conditions in the aperture gives a set of simultaneous equations for the expansion coefficients. Once the solutions of these equations are determined, quantities of interest, such as reflection coefficients, modal coefficients of higher-order modes excited at the aperture, and radiation patterns, are readily obtained without knowing the field distribution in the aperture. Numerical calculations for the radiation patterns, reflection coefficients, and modal coefficients of higher order modes are carried out, and a part of the results is compared with the asymptotic solution by Lee [1970]. The effect of truncation in solving the equations numerically is also studied, and this method is found to exhibit rapid numerical convergence."
"The relative contributions of leaky, surface, and space waves are studied for an open-ended dielectric-loaded waveguide structure using Wiener-Hopf technique with the key step in factorizing the kernel being carried out numerically. The relative field contributions are evaluated by both ordinary saddle-point and modified saddle-point integration methods, and the accuracy of each method in different spatial regions is examined."
"This paper describes the rigorous solution of the problem of reflection and transmission of a plane E wave incident from a homogeneous medium upon a lossless inhomogeneous medium moving uniformly parallel both to the interface and to the plane of incidence by using Maxwell's equations and the constitutive relations for a moving medium. The inhomogeneous medium is assumed to have a linear transition profile of specific permittivity. To describe the influence of the moving inhomogeneous medium in detail, some numerical illustrations of the reflection coefficient and the reflection point of geometrical optics in the inhomogeneous medium are shown. It is found that the reflection point is shifted and the dependence of the reflection coefficient on the width of the inhomogeneous medium is modified in an interesting manner by the motion of the medium."
"A spherical antenna covered by a layer of lossy, hot plasma is considered. The radiated electromagnetic wave and the pseudosonic and electroacoustic waves excited in the plasma layer are determined. The effects due to the pseudosonic and electroacoustic waves on the radiated power, the input conductance, and the input susceptance of the antenna are obtained. Resonance phenomena due to the pseudosonic and electroacoustic waves and the enhancement in radiated power due to the electromagnetic and pseudosonic waves are discussed."

"More than twenty European vertical-sounding stations participated in an intensive period of observation of E3 on June 15, 16, and 17, 1971. Results show that, using values of ƒ0E3 from this network, useful information can be obtained about the structure and movement of E3 clouds."
"Using amateur signals in the 50-MHz band to indicate the presence of oblique-incidence E, paths, the diurnal, seasonal, and magnetic relationships of the phenomena for the years 1964–1970 were examined. Summer double diurnal peaks were found along with ‘off-season’ meteor shower influences."
"An ionosonde has been used to measure the ordinary and extraordinary critical and blanketing frequencies separately. While the results support the idea that transparent sporadic-E reflections occur from small volumes within the E region, it is likely that the plasma density even in these volumes is often less than that required to cause total reflection. The structure of sporadic E is probably as follows: The peak plasma frequency varies by roughly equal amounts above and below a mean value often by a megahertz or so, within a few kilometers. Some intense blobs cause total reflection; other small volumes of increased plasma frequency strongly scatter radio waves of somewhat greater frequency."
"A comparison is made between observation and theory of simultaneously observed wind shear and electron density in the lower ionosphere. The observation was done by K–8–16 rocket flown from Kagoshima Space Center, Japan. The method of characteristics for time-dependent solution of the equation of continuity, which is a partial differential equation of the first order, was used. The calculation shows a remarkable consistency between the observation and the theory even in details. The result strongly supports the wind-shear theory for sporadic-E formation. The solution suggests that the effective recombination rate is 10−8 cm3 sec−1 as found from other ionospheric observations."
"Principal qualitative and semiquantitative expectations of the wind-shear theory of sporadic-E are stated, with special emphasis on the significance of observed time variations in deciding whether the theory is operative and whether the vertical-shear mechanism is dominant. Nine wind profiles and twenty-two sporadic-E observations made in Hawaii are examined in the light of these expectations and are judged to behave consistently with the wind-shear theory."
"The characteristics of midlatitude sporadic-£ layers are observed using rocket payloads incorporating a probe and a propagation experiment. Layers below 120 km show evidence of preferred altitudes. The slopes of layers are within 1° of horizontal. The horizontal dimensions are deduced to be several hundred kilometers. Individual profiles of daytime layers show a range of shapes ranging from triangular to rectangular. The plasma frequency derived from the peak electron density in the layer is found to agree with the blanketing frequency given by the local ionosphere sounder."
"Analysis of frequency distribution of vertical shear of horizontal winds is reported for 2000 samples obtained between 90 and 136 km. The distribution is independent of altitude when shears are normalized by dividing by limiting shears of .075 sec−1 below 110 km, decreasing to .035 sec−1 at 128 km. Associated vertical wavelengths are also altitude independent when normalized, with shortest wavelengths increasing from 3 km at 90 km to 10 km at 136 km. The Richardson number, as a criterion of turbulence, shows that 7% of space/time samples below 110 km will permit turbulence to initiate, while no samples above 115 km will permit onset of turbulence. Viscosities (computed by Hines equation relating viscosity and limiting wavelength) are 30-fold greater than molecular at 90 km, approaching molecular above 115 km. The rate of deposition through viscous shear is 2000–4000 erg g−1 sec−1, but 10% of the samples have a five-fold higher rate, which will significantly affect temperature profiles. The shears found are capable of increasing molecular ion and electron density to about 4 × 103 cm−8 from background ionization levels below 103 cm−8, and to 2 × 104 cm−3 from backgrounds of 104 cm−3. They cannot significantly enhance 105 cm−3 backgrounds."
"Recent developments in wind-shear theory and other midlatitude E2 theory, with a discussion of relevant experimental work, is given. The role of metallic ions and especially their production and loss is not understood. The gradient instability is specifically excluded from this discussion though it is likely to be important"
"A discussion of the observed properties of midlatitude sporadic E leads to the conclusion that vertical redistribution of neutral ionization is the only mechanism by which long-lived metal ions can be concentrated into thin sheets extending over horizontal distances of several hundred kilometers. However, vertical ion transport occasioned by observed wind shears with vertical scales of a few kilometers fails to account for the vertical structure of E, layers and their diurnal and seasonal variations. Experimental evidence indicates that, below 120 km, narrow layers of enhanced ionization coincide with abrupt changes in the magnitude and direction of the wind shear. These changes, marked by corners in the horizontal-wind hodograph, occur over vertical intervals of 100 meters or less. Two alternative physical interpretations of these quasi-discontinuities are discussed (I now regard my earlier suggestion that they represent gravity shocks as unlikely): stable contact discontinuities, across which the temperature and density (but not the vertical component of velocity and not the pressure) change abruptly; very narrow (Δz $\\simeq$ 10 meters) sheets of very high shear (dV/dz $\\simeq$ 0.1 sec−1). It is shown that in either case the layer could function as an effective ion trap. Strong and variable electric polarization fields, however, would interfere with the action of such a trap. Considerations related to the variable component of the polarization field provide a simple and straightforward qualitative explanation for the double-peaked diurnal variation of intense summertime sporadic E, its seasonal variation, and its negative correlation with magnetic activity."
"The role of metal ion chemistry in the atmosphere is briefly reviewed. The available relevant thermal energy binary and three-body reaction rate data are tabulated. The importance of a two-step hydration of metal ions is pointed out, first three-body association of metal ions to CO2 (or possibly O2 or N2) followed by a fast binary ‘switching’ reaction, M+-CO2 + H2O → M+-H2O + CO2 which should be particularly effective for metal ion loss in the D region."
"It is important to determine whether regular tidal winds or irregular gravity waves dominate the transport processes in the E region. This depends on their relative amplitudes. The question became prominent when Chimonas [1971] claimed that ‘the dominant winds in the E region are the solar tidal winds.’ This was a misquotation from another source. The best estimates seem to be that gravity wave amplitudes are rather greater than either of the major solar tidal wind amplitudes at E-region heights. Consequences of assuming otherwise are discussed."
"Sporadic-E (E2) data from Japan were presented to show the temporal variations in sporadic-E blanketing frequency (ƒbE2), virtual height (h'E2), and frequency of occurrence. Tidal winds were substituted into the wind-shear theory of E, to calculate electron density profiles and determine the influence of the tidal winds in the asymmetry of the E8 occurrence variation. Results showed that the tidal wind model used was not strong enough to significantly influence the formation of molecular ion E8 layers, but that the winds did have the proper orientation to accumulate and layer metallic ions in the late afternoon. The role of metallic ions in afternoon E8 will have to be established."
"Studies of sporadic-E data have shown that both the altitude and density of E8 layers vary in lunar time. Possible sources of the lunar effect are motions of the E8 layer produced by the electrostatic field associated with the lunar ionospheric current system, and wind shears in the lunar atmospheric tide. From studies of lunar atmospheric tides and the lunar ionospheric dynamo, values of the electrostatic field and wind shear may be estimated. Simple models are used to determine the effects of these electric-field and wind distributions on £, layers, and the results are compared with the observed lunar variations in E8."
"The cross-field instability is an important process in the explanation of small-scale sporadic E. Differences in the theories presented by different authors are apparent. It is true that there is no one-to-one correspondence of each Fourier component of perturbation between the electric field and the electron density about the direction of the ambient density gradient. The question arises as to how to choose properly the perturbation in the ambient charge gradient; but the difficulty does not seem serious. Computer experiments using realistic perturbations are desirable for the final answer on this question. The short-circuiting effect along the geomagnetic field does not damp the electrical polarization with small transverse size, i.e., small east-west wavelength. The upper limit of this size is a few hundred meters."
"A common test of the wind-shear theory of sporadic E is to compare wind profiles with corresponding electron density profiles. The relationship between the two measurements is not always obvious. The presence of electric fields and vertical movement of the wind profile has been suggested to account for this. However, it is shown that the position of electron density maxima relative to the horizontal winds must lie in certain height ranges irrespective of electric fields or wind profile movements, provided these are steady. If the winds were suddenly to change, it would take time for the electron density profile to change. The time constants involved are estimated. Thus it should be possible to say whether the experimental results are consistent with the idea that the elecron density profile is produced by the wind profile."
"A three-dimensional linear analysis is made of the cross-field instability for a geometry in which the magnetic field lines make an arbitrary angle with the direction of density gradient. A general formula of the growth rate is obtained for a perturbation over whose scale the background quantities do not change appreciably. Applying the formula to the lower ionosphere, we find that the results of an earlier analysis [Tsuda et al., 1966] are recovered as a special case; that is, the present instability is a potential source of small-scale irregularities in temperate latitude E region, as well as in the equatorial E region."

"The multiple error performance of a phase-shift-keyed (PSK) communications system, when both cochannel interference (due possibly to other cochannel angle-modulated systems) and Gaussian noise additively perturb the transmitted signals, is considered. The results are fairly general: the main requirement is that the interference be circularly symmetric. All of our findings are also applicable to the case when only noise is present. The results indicate that one cannot approximate well the effect of interference on the performance of a PSK system by treating it as additional Gaussian noise. First, we derive the probability density function ƒA of the phase angle of a cosinusoid plus interference and Gaussian noise. We then obtain readily computable expressions (in terms of ƒA) for the probability of any number of consecutive errors in an m-phase system when either coherent or differential detection is utilized. For numerical results, the interference is assumed to be due to other cochannel angle-modulated communications systems, and the double error probability and conditional probability of error are given for 2- and 4-phase systems."
