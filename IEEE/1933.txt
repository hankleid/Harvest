"The Institute of Radio Engineers was formed in 1912 through the amalgamation of the Society of Wireless Telegraph Engineers and the Wireless Institute. Its headquarters were established in New York City and the membership has grown from less than fifty members at the start to almost six thousand by the end of 1932. The Institute functions solely to advance the theory and practice of radio and allied branches of engineering and of the related arts and sciences, their application to human needs, and the maintenance of a high professional standing among its members. Among the methods of accomplishing this need is the publication of papers, discussions, and communications of interest to the membership. The PROCEEDINGS is the official publication of the Institute and in it are published all of the papers, discussions, and communications received from the membership which are accepted for publication by the Board of Editors. Copies are sent without additional charge to all members of the Institute."

"The output characteristics of triode and pentode valves have been investigated in the past by many workers, using either the static method of plotting a whole family of curves, or the dynamic method of measurement with a harmonic analyzer: these have not, however, led to many simplifying generalizations, and are cumbersome and difficult methods if they are to be applied to each individual valve. In this paper, the form of the triode curves is first investigated experimentally, and the allowable limits of dynamic swing thus determined for any given per cent harmonic: on this basis, a series of expressions are mathematically developed giving the required output characteristics in terms of an easily obtained valve constant (i.e., the valve alternating-current resistance at Va= 100, Vg= 0; this is the standard figure quoted by English manufacturers). Curves are given for output and correct plate current with various values of resistive load and of per cent harmonic limit, with or without conditions of limited anode dissipation. The case of the practical load with low direct-current resistance is examined, and the results are checked with a harmonic analyzer; the paper concludes with a few practical rules. It is hoped in a future paper to extend the analysis to cover push-pull circuits, the pentode valve, and the practical inductive load."
"This paper gives the current and output relations for the linear and square-law diode detector in terms of the detection efficiency and the detector and load resistances. The square-law case is shown to yield results similar to the linear for large input potentials and reasonable values of load. Employing the rectification-current-input-voltage characteristic, the graphical method is used to show that serious distortion is developed for deep modulation whenever an appreciable audio load is shunted across the diode resistor. It is found that M = 1 + D(A-1), where M is the modulation ratio at which cut-off begins, D the detection efficiency, and A the ratio of the audio impedance to the direct-current value of the diode load. The value of M is shown for various load conditions in both the linear and square-law cases. The paper shows that the use of a small condenser across the load decreases the detection efficiency but increases the input impedance. The connection to the driving circuit of a second diode for the development of automatic volume control potential is shown to cause distortion when such a tube is used with a delay bias. Mention is made of the importance of considering the impedance of the driving circuit, and attention is called to the failure of any of the methods of analysis to consider all of the factors involved."
"A brief résumé of Heising's modulator theory is presented together with a discussion of the class B operation of tubes in a push-pull audio-frequency circuit. Several cases of commercial applications of class B audio amplifiers are mentioned. Several general problems involved in the use of a class B audio amplifier are discussed with the conclusion that such an amplifier will produce more audio power for a given tube complement, at higher efficiency, and with less distortion than amplifiers previously used in commercial applications."
"The investigations of the frequency variations in oscillating systems with negative nonlinear resistance were based until now on the fundamental differential equation of the simple oscillatory circuit. This method, although very exact, is not always sufficiently simple and even not always possible, especially if it concerns more complicated schemes. The symbolic calculus, although very simple in use, if applied to the nonlinear systems, gives only approximate results. The following paper represents the operation of nonlinear systems from a different point of view. Here the symbolic calculus has been used throughout in a complete and exact manner, by employing it for the fundamental frequency as well as for all harmonic frequencies which appear in the system. This could be done owing to the investigation of the negative resistance operation from the energy point of view. It was taken into consideration, that in the negative resistance characteristics i = f(v), i must be the univocal function of v, and therefore the area described by the instantaneous point of work during one cycle of the fundamental oscillation must be zero or, ⨖ idv = 0. On the other hand i and v can be considered, with regard to the external circuit connected to the negative resistance, as the sum of harmonic currents and voltages. In this way we obtain the formulas which allow the interdependence of the frequency variation and the content of harmonics to be determined."
"A circuit is described in which a type 57, three-grid tube functions as two triodes in two separate oscillator circuits. One of the circuits is a crystal oscillator, and the other is a self-excited circuit which is controlled by the crystal so that it oscillates at a subharmonic of the crystal frequency."
"The reasons for overloading of detectors as output devices is discussed. It is shown that in grid circuit rectification replacing the grid leak with a high impedance choke extends the overload point considerably. Using a 247 type pentode 800 milliwatts are obtained at the output circuit with seven per cent maximum distortion."
"(a) A crystal is made to oscillate by subjecting it to the action of an air wave produced at a considerable distance from the crystal by a jet of air escaping from a small tube. The piezo-electric charge developed on the surface of the crystal as a result of the oscillation is mapped out by means of a tuned amplifier, and the vibration is analyzed into a fundamental and many overtones. For crystals that are long in one dimension, the overtones are nearly exact harmonics. (b) Exciting the crystal electrically by means of two tubes and especially designed electrodes, any harmonic up to the tenth can be produced. The crystal usually has only one mode of vibration for each pair of electrodes."
"The theory on the transmission of high-frequency radio waves developed by one of the authors in a previous paper is applied to practical problems, and a systematic method of calculating the field strengths of high-frequency waves is established. The property of the ionization chart is explained and the method of construction of the chart is given. Practical examples of calculations are shown with respect to Tokio-Cape Town and Tokio-Melbourne circuits. The present method is most useful not only for the projection of a new high-frequency communication route, but also for the investigations of high-frequency transmission phenomena. From a number of measurements made on high-frequency transmission, it is shown that the coefficient of recombination in the F layer is about 1.5 × 10-10[sec-1] this value being in fairly good coincidence with the theoretical value."
"The characteristic of a nonlinear transducer can usually be expanded in a power series, when it is not simply a single term raised to some power. For those cases where the characteristic may be so expressed, a general law or equation is derived for the characteristic of a compensating transducer, that is, a transducer which in combination with the first transducer will produce over-all linearity. It is shown, moreover, that when the series for the distorting transducer is not sufficiently rapid in its convergence, it becomes impractical to realize the necessary compensating transducer. A simple case of an actual compensating transducer used to correct a square-law characteristic is briefly described."
"Absolute formulas for the calculation of the mutual inductance of coaxial solenoids, although they are required for work of the great precision necessary in absolute measurements, are not convenient for routine calculations. Series formulas, although simpler, are limited in the range of their convergence, thus requiring the choice of the proper formula for any given problem. The tables and formulas here presented enable the mutual conductance of any two coaxial solenoids whatever to be calculated from a single formula. Examples make clear that a five-figure accuracy may be attained with concentric coils and even with poorly coupled coils the error does not exceed a few parts in ten thousand."
"It is shown that the maximum possible current which can be obtained through an impedance joining two points of a linear network is in general greater than the short-circuit current between those points; the maximum possible voltage is in general greater than the open-circuit voltage; the ratio of open-circuit voltage to short-circuit current is equal to the ratio of the maximum possible voltage to the maximum possible current, and both are equal to the magnitude of the input impedance of the network, etc. The condition for maximum voltage across a branch of a linear network is derived. As a preliminary, a form of Thevenin's theorem different from the usual one and of greater usefulness in the analytical solution of some circuit problems is obtained."

"Graphite has been found to possess a number of advantages over materials which have heretofore been used in the construction of anodes for high vacuum transmitting tubes of the radiation-cooled type. Graphite has a higher radiation emissivity, resulting in lower glass temperatures and therefore less danger of glass electrolysis and strain cracking. Its use avoids anode warping and therefore results in tubes of much greater electrical uniformity. With proper manufacturing methods, there is no sacrifice in tube life when graphite is substituted for molybdenum."
"A method of determining \"complete\" plate and grid characteristics of vacuum tubes in the positive grid region by means of oscillographic recording has been developed. A condenser of high capacity furnishes a single pulse of grid excita tion which can be made to cover the entire region from any desired positive grid voltage to zero. Due to the rapidity of this excitation instantaneous power input to the tube of twenty to thirty times nominal rating has been recorded without danger to the tubes. Several typical complete charts of plate and grid characteristics obtained by this method for an experimental tube of the so-called \"50-watt\" type are given. The experimental procedure in obtaining these characteristics is discussed in detail. Also the circuit for obtaining oscillographically the highly important \"composite diode line,\" with Ep= Eg, is described. The inadequacy of the usual logarithmic extrapolation of zero-grid characteristics into the positive grid region is discussed. The complete plate and grid current charts, which can be obtained accurately only by an oscillographic method, are practically indispensable in precalculation of class B and class C performance. The method has been successfully used in studying the characteristics of the smallest and the largest existing tubes in this country."
"Thyratron rectifiers for supplying high voltage direct current to radio transmitting tube life test racks are superior to motor-generator sets where quietness, flexibility, low operating cost, and safe operation over long intervals of time are desirable. An installation for supplying typical voltages, in conjunction with usual forms of electric power supplies is described. This consists of two high power rectifiers for 425 and 1000 volts direct current plate supplies and a low power 125-volt direct current rectifier for bias voltage. A control circuit provides complete protection against faults detrimental to tube operating conditions such as low filament voltage, low bias, and resumption of power after failure, insuring a maximum of life testing hours available consistent with safe operation."
"The paper is a theoretical discussion of the limiting polarization of downcoming electromagnetic waves propagated at oblique angles to the earth's magnetic field. The main conclusions arrived at are: (a). The polarization of the downcoming wave tends to a definite limit on leaving the Kennelly-Heaviside layer. The limiting polarization has been shown to be very nearly independent, for conditions that are likely to hold in practice, of the presence of large numbers of heavy negative ions in addition to the electrons, and of the occurrence of collisions between electrons and gas molecules. (b). The shape of the ellipse of polarization is determined by the frequency of the wave relative to the critical frequency, and by the angle between the direction of propagation and the lines of force of the earth's magnetic field. (c). The orientation of the ellipse is such that the principal axes are perpendicular to the direction of propagation, the major axis being in the plane containing the direction of the earth's magnetic field and the direction of propagation. (d). The sense of rotation of the electric vector contained by the ellipse is left-handed when the direction of propagation of the \"ordinary\" downcoming ray makes an acute angle with the earth's field; the rotation is right-handed when the angle is obtuse."
"An approximate method of determining the power required to drive the grid circuit of a vacuum tube power amplifier of the class C type when operating at radio frequencies is developed, and a comparison given between the results obtained by this method, and more exact measurements made at sixty cycles. The only quantities which need to be known for the method described are the grid excitation voltage and the direct grid current, the driving power being given by the formula Wd= √2EgIc."
"A general solution for the amplitude characteristics (resonance curves) for bridge-coupled circuits having distributed line constants is obtained and applied to typical circuit arrangements including those encountered in wavelength measurement using parallel wires. The physical conditions under which the theory may be applied are analyzed; theoretical curves are computed for a typical selection of constants, and are shown to be in excellent agreement with corresponding experimental ones. A new precision method for measuring ultra-short waves is described; the maximum deflection and the minimum deflection methods are shown to be exact. A method is devised for experimentally determining the characteristics of short-wave detectors, and for measuring their input impedance at ultra-high frequencies. The screen-grid resonance indicator is shown to have a linear resonance current-deflection characteristic, and its input impedance is measured at 434 centimeters wavelength."
"Certain fundamental characteristics of the theory of frequency modulation for arbitrarily large degrees of modulation and unrestricted modulation frequencies are developed from the differential equation for a dissipationless circuit with fixed inductance and variable capacitance. The several modes of modulating the frequency are discussed and classified; it is shown that they give the same results only when the amount of modulation is very small. The case of \"inverse capacity modulation\" is then treated in detail. This treatment discloses the possibility of unstable oscillations occurring with certain values of the parameters; the nature and physical significance of these unstable oscillations are determined, and it is explained why they are not ordinarily observable in radio-frequency modulation or in the warble tone generator. The frequency spectrum of the stable oscillations is found, and a means of calculating the amplitude given. For certain adjustments of the circuit the oscillations may be represented by a true Fourier series, while in general this is not the case. Frequency modulation in radiotelephony, the warble tone, and the special case where the natural period of the unmodulated circuit and the frequency of modulation are of comparable magnitude, represent successively more complicated cases of the same general phenomena; the latter is of special interest. The nature of the phenomena accompanying other than a sinusoidal inverse capacity variation is mentioned."
"Expansion of the current as a function of the voltage in a multiple Fourier series is used to solve the problem of determining the amplitude of the various frequency components produced when a voltage is applied across a resistance, the current in which varies as a power of the voltage across it. Recurrence formulas are developed by which the higher order products can be computed from those of lower order. Certain of the integral coefficients in the Fourier series expansion are evaluated in the form of double summations. The method is applied to a specific case, and sample calculations carried through in detail. While the method is not as well adapted to obtaining qualitative results as are the usual forms of analysis, it does appear to have some advantages when numerical results are required, or when the effects of the contributions of higher order products are to be studied."
"The solution of certain electrical networks can be made to depend on the solution of a much-studied mathematical problem in difference equations. This fact, while recognized for some time, has not received as much attention as it deserves. On the following pages we have worked out several relatively simple electrical networks by the method of difference equations. Our aim was not to obtain the solutions of the particular cases considered, but rather to illustrate the procedure involved."

"The author has brought to the attention of the editors errors to various equations that occurred in his paper, \"Transmission Curves of High-Frequency Networks,\" which was published in the January, 1933, issue of the Proceedings. The pages affected are 122, 123, 130, 138 and 139."
"The application of radiotelephony to municipal police work in New York City is described from the organization viewpoint. Brief references are made to historical backgrounds and description of apparatus, and the steps taken to select a receiver suitable for local conditions are outlined. The method of controlling the patrolforce by radio is described at some length with examples, and a summary of results during the first year is given to show the value of this means of communication to police work."
"The action of a highly selective simple tuned circuit located between a source of radio-frequency energy and the terminals of a detector is discussed. Next, the effect of linear and of square-law detection together with an audio-frequency tone correction system is described. Various interference conditions are analyzed with the aid of graphical construction."
"The present paper gives the practical results of an extensive analysis of the detection of two modulated waves of identical carrier frequency. It is shown that the total effects of time delay in the program distribution circuits, differences in circuit elements in the two transmitters, and differences in path lengths of the two signals in traveling from their respective transmitters to the receiving point, may all be expressed in terms of two fundamental angles, γ and β. γ is the phase angle between the two carriers at the receiving point, and β is an angle determining the relation between the side frequencies received from the two stations. At any given point there will be a different value of β for each modulation frequency. Analyses in terms of β and γ yield quantitative descriptions of the distortions present in the rectified wave. From these results it is possible to determine how the distortions vary from point to point in space and upon what significant quantities they are dependent. Experimental work has been carried out in the laboratory which confirms the results of the theoretical analysis and which shows in a striking manner the effects of small time delays on the quality of the received signal. This work agrees with theory in showing that time delays, of the order of 200 microseconds, may be responsible for serious distortion, and that a delay as small as 50 microseconds requires a 2:1 carrier ratio to prevent distortion."
"A receiving equipment and calibration method is described for the measurement in absolute units of 5.1-meter (58.8-megacycle) field strengths. A transmitter of low power is used. The attenuation of the waves is discussed, and a field strength contour map of Ann Arbor, Michigan, and vicinity is presented. The attenuation constant is found to be 0.36. Experiments on receiving antenna lengths show the importance of a properly resonant receiving antenna. The field distribution around the transmitting antenna is investigated by rotations of the antenna with the receiver at a fixed location. The polarization of the waves is studied, and results indicate that horizontally polarized radiation is more rapidly attenuated than is the vertically polarized."
"This paper describes a qualitative study of the degrees of television definition required for the adequate portrayal of various scenes under various conditions. Still photographs transmitted by telephoto are examined. It is found that 60-line, 120-line and higher orders of television definition may be suitable for certain missions conditioned by general factors such as the comprehensiveness of the scene to be portrayed."
"A rod of monel metal supported at its mid-point and fitted with two coils, one on each end, shielded from each other, and supplied with a polarizing magnetic field, resonates sharply at its natural longitudinal frequency to a voltage impressed on one coil, and induces a voltage in the other only while vibrating. It is thus a very selective band-pass filter. The attenuation is more than sixty decibels off resonance and about twenty at resonance. The band is about seventy cycles wide, thirty decibels up from the minimum, when the resonant frequency is 20,000 cycles. The effect of heat treatment and the design of the coils and shields are discussed. Actually two rods in series, coupled by a vacuum tube are used. This gives a curve only seventy cycles wide, as much as sixty decibels up from the minimum. The attentuation is found to be low at frequencies below about 8,000 cycles and there is a rather sharp minimum at 16,000 cycles due to some mode of vibration other than the longitudinal one. These defects, however, may easily be remedied by the use of a high-pass filter of conventional design."
"This paper presents data recently obtained on physical and electrical properties of Mycalex, a material having extensive and growing applications in the design of radio apparatus. The electrical data relate to the frequency range to 100,000 kilocycles."
"An expression for the radiation resistance of a cylinder is derived, following the \"tangential field\" or \"induced electromotive force\" method as adapted by Pistolkors. The result is used to determine the radiation resistance of a segment of a concentric cylinder transmission line, as used in ultra-high-frequency oscillator circuits. A comparision is made with the more conventional parallel wire line segment. Numerical computations are made for the case of a line one-half wavelength long, with a radius (for the concentric line) and a spacing (for the open line) of one-twentieth of a wavelength. These are believed to be the largest dimensions to be encountered in practice. The resistances are, respectively, 0.086 ohm and 3.02 ohms, showing the concentric line to be definitely superior as far as radiation losses are concerned."
"This report gives the monthly and annual averages of field intensities of ten European and three American low-frequency transatlantic radio stations, between frequencies of 16 and 24 kilocycles, and the field intensity averages of atmospherics on 15 and 23 kilocycles, observed at the Bureau of Standards, for the years 1931 and 1932. Measurements were made by the telephone current comparison method. Annual average curves of daylight field intensities of European signals and afternoon atmospherics on 23 kilocycles are shown with the corresponding yearly averages of sun spot numbers. A monthly average field intensity curve of Tuckerton WCI, 18.4 kilocycles, shows a return from the high values obtained in 1930 and 1931 to the average value of previous years. Some correlations between polarization of the reflected wave and sun spot numbers derived from a year of continuous recording of Tuckerton WCI, on loop antennas, are shown. The possibility of obtaining an independent value for the ground wave from such a series of observations is suggested."

"In an analysis of electric power costs there are two elements that make up the load; first, the power or kilowatts, and second, the energy or kilowatt hours. It is, of course, impossible to have one without the other and the relation between the two is expressed by the load factor. In the analysis, either the power is assumed to be constant and the energy will vary with the load factor or the energy is assumed to be constant and the power or kilowatts will vary with the load factor. In the analysis of hydroelectric power costs, the energy output of the generating station per year is fixed by the stream flow so that the kilowatts are assumed to vary inversely with the load factor. The units of cost, in the above analysis of hydroelectric power costs, are so arranged that if the system load factor changed from what it had been when the plant was designed, the annual cost would change to correspond to that of a plant designed and built for the new load factor. If the revenue from all the different loads supplied by the plant is based on the demand and energy costs as derived for the plant, the total revenue received will correspond to the annual expenses of the station as if designed for the plant load factor. Diversity losses, reserve capacity and customer costs must of course be considered in arriving at the annual costs and plant load."
"When a three-wire d-c. generator with a two-phase static balancer operates with an unbalanced load it is possible that cumulative saturation effects may exist in the balancer core whose magnitude is out of all proportion to the small magnetic unbalance which usually results from the design of the balancer phases. By obtaining an expression for the e.m.f. induced in the balancer winding by the alternating flux the conditions under which these phenomena may be present are studied. It is shown that they are affected by any difference in the resistance of the phases, and that in general their magnitudes vary inversely as the sum of the resistances of the armature winding and the balancer. These conclusions are confirmed by test results and oscillograms taken on an actual machine which show that the maximum flux density in the balancer core may rise to as much as twice the value for which it was designed. The large peaks which occur in the magnetizing current affect the heating of the balancer and also, to a less extent, that of the generator. They also cause considerable pulsations in the terminal voltages of the system."
"Corona loss measurements were obtained on conductors of three different diameters; namely, 1.125 in., 1.49 in. and 2.0 in. Voltages up to 600-kv. line voltage were used in these measurements. Various surface conditions of the 1.125-in. cable were studied. These measurements include tests on the new cable as received, the cable as washed, scratch brushed, buffed and dragged. The aging of the dragged cable was observed for seven months. Data were obtained on the daily variation of loss. The effects of configuration and transposition were studied on No. 22 wire. A description of the modifications in the high-voltage wattmeter for these high-voltage measurements is reported."
"The importance of triple-harmonic voltages and currents in electrical power systems is generally recognized by engineers associated with the power and telephone industries. It is desirable to have some convenient method of representation and calculation of the triple-frequency effects in three-phase power systems. The path of the third-harmonic current is different fromn that of the fundamental current and for this reason the circuit can be considered as separate and, distinct. The characteristics of the triplefrequency circuit as determined by laboratory experiment are given in this paper. Methods of measurement of the required quantities for accurate solution of the triple-frequency circuit are described. The results of an experimental investigation of the equivalent triple-frequency circuit as proposed by H. S. Osborne in 1915 are set forth. A typical simple three-phase power network has been set up and the measured currents compared with computed values. Oscillograms are presented of voltages and currents with typical transformer connections demonstrating the principles of operation of the circuit both for normal and abnormal excitation conditions. The effects of various types of connected loads are discussed, with particular attention given to the condition of triple-frequency resonance. It is shown that triple-frequency resonance occurs when the external capacitive reactance of the circuit is equal to the triple-frequency no-load impedance of the transformer. Resonance produces large triple-frequency currents and serious distortion of the line-to-neutral voltage of the system."
"This paper describes the radio plant of R.C.A. Communications, Inc. Charts are given showing the growth of the services handled through this plant. Some of the technical requirements of the service are discussed and the means for meeting these requirements disclosed. In describing the facilities in use, they are divided into three general divisions, namely, central offices, transmitting stations, and receiving stations. Most of the recent development of this plant lies in the field of short wave operations, i. e., frequencies between 3,000 and 30,000 kc."
"The paper describes radiotelephone experiments that have been carried out over comparativelly short distances on the North Pacific Coast during the last three years, employing equipment that has primarily been developed for Air Transport Communication. Commercial operation extending over a year has proved the feasibility of such a service where physical plant is economically impossible."
"A simple method is given for the precise calculation of temperature variations in underground power cables due to sudden changes in loading. It is shown how the same method is employed for finding the oil demands of oil-filled cables under similar circumstances. A generalization is introduced which permits the temperature variations and oil demands of cables to be readily calculated for load variations of any sort whatever. A method of finding the pressure at any point in the cable insulation at any time is also outlined. The simplified methods eliminate the necessity for a knowledge of higher mathematics and Bessel functions, which would be required in using the fundamental equations. Calculating charts and other devices permit complete solutions to be obtained in less than 290 per cent of the time formerly required."
"The problem of lightning protection of cables is more active at the present time than it has been in the past. This is du-e largely to the fact that cables of higher voltage connected directly to overhead lines are becoming very common; cables in the form of short sections are especially liable to need protection. The cost of the cable, the importance of the line from the operating standpoint, and the cost of protective equipment all enter into the picture. In the present paper the factors which determine whether or not a cable will require protective equipment are discussed, and new and simplified formulas, representing with considerable precision any of the standard coordinating waves are developed. These formulas can be used for open-ended cable lines, or cable sections in transmission lines. Where cables terminate in station apparatus, the assumption of an open-circuited cable end may be safely used, since it always gives a calculated value of voltage that is somewhat above the true value. The effect of cable length and surge impedance and of line surge impedance are illustrated in detail. Tentative data on the impulse strength of cable insulation are also included."
"A new type of insulation has been developed by the Bell System engineers and put into use for exchange area cables. This insulation consists of a continuous pulp or paper sleeve formed directly on the conductor by a modified paper making process. The manufacture and use of pulp-insulated wire cables involves unique changes in manufacturing equipment, materials and methods, in cable design and installation practises. The development has covered a period of some ten years and is the result of combined manufacturing, engineering, and field studies."
"The paper outlines the uses of telephone cable for distributiotn. purposes in typical metropolitan areas, susch as Baltimore add Washington. It includes some historical background as to the development of cable and the part it takes in the present overall plant investment. The division of metropolitan areas into central office areas and the various types of distribution are discussed. The engineering procedure followed in the design of cable distributing plant to provide economically a metallic circuit of satisfactory transmission quality to connect each subscriber's telephone with the central office involves the consideration of many factors."
"This paper gives a brief survey on the economic relationship of hydro and steam power during the past decade, followed by an analysis of typical hydro power costs, divided into the four components; base cost, incremental capacity, transmission, and tie-in facilities. The value of hydro power is analyzed by comparison with the two main components of steam cost, capacity and energy. The possibilities of increasing installed hydro capacity at low incremental cost are emphasized and a method is described of making such low cost capacity furnish firm peak service on the combined hydro-steam load system."
"The Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation has recently completed the dam and initial section of the power house to develop the fall of the Susquehanna river between the Holtwood project backwater and Columbia, Pennsylvania. This development, when completed, will be one of the largest hydroelectric developments in the United States. In the initial project there will be installed 255,000 turbine horse-power, and in the completed project 510,000 turbine horsepower. One of the most notable features is the 42,500-hp. Kaplan turbines, the most powerful ever built and the largest in physical dimensions so far installed on this continent. In the average year, with full utilization, the initial project will generate over 800,000,000 kw-hr. for distribution through the transmission system of the Pennsylvania Water and Power Company to Baltimore, Maryland, and Pennsylvania customers. Transmission to Baltimore will be at 230 kv. and to Pennsylvania customers at 69 kv. and 132 kv. The power house and dam have a combined length of 5,000 ft.; the length of the dam is 4,084 ft., and the ultimate length of the power house is 916 ft. The spillway length is 1,810 ft.; the spillway is equipped for its entire length with crest gates, of which there are thirty-two 48 ft. long and 35 ft. high. The discharge capacity of the spillway at normal elevation 225.0, is 970,000 c.f.s., and at forebay elevation 227.0 (ultimate) 1,150,000 c.f.s. The lake created by the dam impounds a useful storage of 3 billion cu. ft."
"This paper describes how the energy from the new Safe Harbor line is received in Baltimore and how it fits into the total energy supply of steam and hydro. Safe Harbor energy being 60 cycles required a change in frequency from 62½ cycles and is tied in to the 25-cycle system by a 30,000-kw. frequency changer, the characteristics and control of which are described. A bank of surge-proof transformers of 126,000-kva. capacity steps down Safe Harbor energy to 33 kv., handled in a new outdoor substation. This 33-kv. system ties in to both Westport and Gould St. generating stations and through them to the transmission system to Baltimore substations and surrounding territory."
"In the last few years very rapid progress has been made abroad in developing the theory of low-head developments and this has resulted in a wider use of Kaplan turbines. Every engineer interested in the design of low-head developments should familiarize himself with at least the principles of this theoretical work and its practical application. The paper gives a general outline of the present situation which seems to have been somewhat neglected in the United States. Starting with general ideas about Francis, propeller, and Kaplan tarbines in low-head developments, the important points are discussed with respect to cavitation and pitting, modern design theories, design of propeller and Kaplan turbines and the research requirements and practise. Next the practical application of the theories are demonstrated by a table of designs executed or projected, and finally, some of the tendencies in extending the use of Kaplan turbines for higher and much lower heads are discussed."
"The Safe Harbor plant is the first large development in this country to use the Kaplan type of turbine. This paper describes the problems of design and operation which were comprehensively studied by means of model and field tests, with particular regard to the power limits of the turbines as established from a study of cavitation."
"The paper describes the principle of a resistor coupled condenser discharge circuit as a means for indicating the rate of change of an electrical potential. The application of this circuit to an impulse relay which may be used in connection with quick response excitation regulating equipment is outlined. The principle of operation of an electronic voltage regulator is referred to, and an oscillogram is given indicating the definite anti-hunting action which can be obtained with the condenser discharge circuit as an anti-hunting means. A thermionic type automatic synchronizer, which requires only 5 voltamperes per potential transformer, is described in detail. The paper treats the method by which, for any frequency difference within limits of present operating practise, the synchronizer will cause the closing coil of the circuit breaker to be energized in advance of synchronism by a time equal to that required to close the breaker, so that, assuming the frequency difference between the two systems remains constant during the short time required to close the breaker, the breaker contacts will always be closed at the instant of zero voltage phase displacement. A formula has been derived whereby the synchronizer ``advance'' may be calculated for various frequency differences when the constants of the thermionic circuits are known, and the results obtained with the thermionic type automatic synchronizer in a generating station with propeller type water wheels are described."
"The discovery and importance of a high-velocity vapor stream issuing from the cathode region of a vacuum arc led to a summary of the experiments showing the existence of a vapor stream and a review of the theories proposed to account for it. The velocities were determined from: (1) force on the cathode and loss weight by the cathode; (2) force on a vane in front of the cathode, and mass of cathode material deposited on the vane; and (3) energy imparted to vane, and mass of material deposited. Methods (1), (2) and (3) on the copper arc gave vapor velocities from 1 to 2.5 × 106 cm/sec, while method (1) on a mercury arc gave an average of 2.24 × 106 cm/sec. Sources of error would not change the above values greatly. Several proposed theories are shown to be inadequate; the one possible theory (Risch and Lüdi) is based upon the presence of multiply-charged ions which leave the cathode after neutralization with a high velocity."
"The equation V = A + B/In which correctly represents all normal arc characteristics is used as the starting point for a general discussion of arc phenomena and industrial applications. Tests of this equation are applied to iron arcs in various gas atmospheres to obtain a series of values for A and B, making possible certain deductions about arc voltage variations and significance of the characteristics. In limiting the current exponent n, the anode temperature must exert considerable influence on the discharge as a whole. Suggestions are given why this may be so. A value of n is predicted from the arc stream geometry, and is compared with actual values of n for various arcs. From energy considerations of this equation new concepts of the ``minimum energy'' and the ``excess energy'' requirements in the arc conduction process are gained. Some applications to arc problems prove these concepts valuable. On this basis high temperature arcs are shown to be the most efficient. Light intensity and probe measurements on the arc stream suggest a new physical picture of high current arcs. Some difficulties are removed in accounting for energy equilibrium at the welding arc cathode."
"This paper gives a mathematical analysis of armature and field transients in d-c generators of the type used in arc welding. The analysis is reduced to the simplest form, and is exact, under the premises given. Armature and field currents only are treated, and comparisons between calculated and experimental graphs are shown."
"Extensive tests have demonstrated important advantages favoring the use of high frequency current for electric arc welding and have led to the development of a 900-cycle double induction generator of attractive characteristics and capable of supplying several different arcs at once. Some test results and a description of the high frequency generator are given."
"Large railroad systems are complex organizations requiring extensive communication services to handle their special operating problems and to enable them adequately to reach and serve the public. Brief descriptions of the major requirements for circuits, switchboards, radio, carrier, plant and apparatus are given."
"The paper gives a description of the communication services required for operation of the Pennsylvania Railroad and for the convenience of its patrons, also a description of the company-owned outside plant required to provide the service, together with tabulations showing the magnitude of some classes of business handled and plant involved."
"A description of one railroad's signal system limits most of the detail to the type of signals and interlockings standard on that particular road, however, there are many features of inter-locking and signal control that are common to most modern signal systems. These features are described briefly in the paper. Following a brief description of the earliest forms of signaling employed on The Reading Railroad, this paper describes the Reading's most recent installation of 100 cycle alternating current color light signaling. The 100 cycle frequency was first used in the continuous coded train control territory, where a distinctive frequency was required to eliminate any possibility of foreign inductive interference, and was later adopted for use in electrified territory, as the range between the 100-cycle signal frequency and the 25-cycle electrification frequency permitted the use of frequency selective track relays. The main features of the Reading's loop and code systems of continuous automatic train control and those of the automatic signaling and power interlockings are described in this paper."
"This paper describes the facilities provided for centralized traffic control and gives detailed information with respect to two installations on the B. & O. Railroad. The operation of an intermittent inductive auto-manual train stop system on the B. & O. Railroad is also discussed."

"The Differential Analyzer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has made possible the rapid and accurate solution of the idealized non-linear differential equations of motion of synchronous motors which describe the pulling-into-step transients. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of these solutions in a useable form. These results give a rather complete analysis of the phenomena, and thus enable the determination of the performance of practically any machine. One of the factors which is considered in this paper is the time constant of the field circuit with the armature short-circuited. Curves are given showing the additional load which may be synchronized when the field switching is angularly controlled to the best angle. The influence of salient poles has been considered as well as non-uniformity of the amortisseur winding. The practical application of the study is indicated by a numerical example."
"The analysis presented in a previous paper is extended to include a consideration of synchronizing and damping torque during continuous and transient oscillations, the description of an equivalent circuit which has been found useful in calculating the decrement of the short circuit current of interconnected machines, and the derivation of simple approximate formulas for the roots of the equation determining the wave shape of the current on three-phase short circuit."
"This paper describes a simple method of plotting acceleration curves by resolving the reactance and resistance of the transformer, reactive coil, and wiring into a single effective reactance and effective resistance for each open-circuit transformer secondary voltage. By the use of these factors and the motor characteristics simple calculations can be made to determine with any given motor voltage and load the required open-circuit voltage of the transformer. Any errors introduced by the use of the approximate values of effective reactance and resistance are of very minor value and do not appreciably affect the final results."
"The operation of the 3,000-volt direct-current passenger locomotives on the Cleveland Union Terminals electrification has been studied after an initial period of service of more than two years. Twenty-two locomotives weighing 210 tons each are in service, normally handling passenger trains weighing 1,275 tons trailing over grades as high as 1.56 per cent. During the two years over 1,000,000 miles of operation have been recorded, divided between about 410,000 miles per year for passenger service and 90,000 miles for switching. These figures indicate that the average performance in switching service is about two miles per hour, whereas the customary method of accounting credits switching locomotives with six miles per hour. An analysis of the average time used for inspection and repairs shows an availability of 92 per cent. For the same period the utilization factor of 54 per cent is observed. The utilization factor will doubtless be improved with a resumption of normal traffic. Data is given on energy consumption, both in road and in switching service, and curves are plotted showing the variation in energy consumption with different train weights. The all-day average in coach-yard switching is found to be about 85 kwhr per hour per locomotive, including auxiliaries, or a net average of about 55 kwhr per hour. Interesting records of brush wear, data on replacement of hub liners, wear on pantograph strips and condition of commutator and motor bearings are produced."
"The general system problem encountered in the supply of power for electric traction is dealt with through a study of the performance of the principal available systems. The paper is confined to the electrical characteristics and consequent capacity and spacing requirements. The first part describes the performance of systems in electrical terms and requires no assumptions as to the magnitude of train loads. Index figures are developed for specifying concisely the characteristics considered, and curves are given for determining substation loads and catenary rms current and regulation. The second part provides a perspective of power system requirements with various systems through a general study of distribution and transmission based on a number of assumed train loads. Fleets of trains of equal size and uniform spacings are made the basis for the generalized solution of the distribution and transmission problems as well as for the study based on specific load conditions. The essential electrical dimensions of most of the heavy traction electrifications of the world are tabulated."
"Particular reference is made in this paper, to a recently developed, greatly simplified control system for high-voltage, single-phase locomotives, where the entire heavy and bulky switch-gear is replaced by a simple high-voltage tap changer. A short description is also given of various other control systems which are today used on electric single-phase locomotives, and the strong and weak features of such systems are discussed. No reference is made to control systems for split-phase or motor-generator locomotives."
"A single-unit mercury arc rectifier of 3,000-kw rating at 600 volts is discussed as regards design and operation. A typical installation, that of the 8th Avenue subway of the New York Board of Transportation, is described where units of this size have been advantageously applied to the sub-surface substations. An important characteristic of the rectifier unit is its operating temperature which is materially higher than heretofore used in general practise. Tests show that up to a certain temperature the arc drop is reduced as the temperature is raised. This indicates that the maximum efficiency is obtained by operating at a high temperature. Among other advantages of a high operating temperature is the increased cooling efficiency. The rectifier is of the thyratron type with insulated grids surrounding the anodes. In addition to straight rectification, it is expected that it will find many applications in the future where thyratron control is desired."
"The transformer subcommittee of the A.I.E.E. electrical machinery committee presents herewith a progress report covering its work to date on the impulse voltage testing of commercial electric power transformers. A tentative test procedure has been agreed upon, although complete agreement has not yet been reached on all details. It is hoped that this report will stimulate among members of the Institute discussion that will be helpful to the committee in completing a formal test code during the coming year."
"The following conclusions have been reached: 1. The time lag characteristics of major insulation are practically the same for both positive and negative waves. 2. The impulse ratio of major insulation is practically 2.2. 3. The present standard A.I.E.E. tests for the 34.5-kv class and above provide coordination with the proposed coordinating gaps. 4. A.I.E.E. tests below 34.5-kv class are too low and should be increased. 5. Greatest security is obtained if the surge flashover of the bushing is only slightly greater than that of the coordinating gap. A margin of 10 per cent is suggested as the most desirable bushing level."
"The general scheme of coordination is discussed. Average circuit insulation used in 1930 is shown. The relation that switching surges and arcing ground overvoltages bear on coordination is discussed giving the number and magnitude of such waves found in service. Levels of insulation in and around the station for outdoor and indoor apparatus are suggested. It is pointed out why a point gap offers the most reliable method of establishing the level for impulse testing of transformers. Also, reasons are given why bushings as made at present should not be used as the sole level for impulse testing. It is shown that on account of the similarity of the volt-time curves for insulations and sphere gaps for short impulse waves, the use of a sphere gap in parallel with a rod gap will give an added protection against direct strokes on or near the apparatus terminals. Also, various proposed schemes are shown to give protection to the transformer and against outages for both fast and slow waves. For potential and current transformers having voltage ratings differing from standard it is suggested that the coordination gaps be selected from the curve of gaps vs. rated circuit voltages. It is shown how an air gap of standardized construction can be used to advantage in expressing the impulse flashover of insulators and bushings. Curves are given showing the gap spacings that are the equivalent in flashover to suspension and pedestal insulators for the ½/5, 1/10 and 1 ½/40 positive and negative waves."
"The problem of providing protection for rotating a-c machines against lightning overvoltages has two parts: 1. The protection of insulation to ground, which is mainly a question of the magnitude of the overvoltage, and 2. The protection of turn insulation, which is primarily a matter of wave front. To meet the first requirement, the overvoltage to ground must be limited to a safe value. This is assumed to be approximately equal to the crest value of the 60-cycle high potential test. To fulfill the second requirement, the turn voltage gradient must be limited to conform to the turn insulation. To secure these results, a protective scheme is proposed, which includes arresters 2,000 feet and 500 feet out on the line, or other means, to limit the incoming voltage to 2.5 times the crest value of the terminal arrester rating, a special arrester at the machine terminal to limit the voltage to the crest value of the machine high potential test, and a capacitor at the machine terminal to slope the wave front, thus limiting the turn-to-turn stresses. The capacitor also serves to limit internal overvoltages due to reflection at the neutral. For neutral grounded solidly or through resistance equal to or less than the combined surge impedance of the machine windings 0.1, μf capacitance is sufficient; while for isolated neutral, capacitance up to 0.5 μf may be necessary. Ground wires over the line for the initial 2,000 feet are recommended to protect against direct strokes."
"Much of the data on impulse voltage testing of insulators and insulation which has been given out in the past has been obtained on a basis that renders it of little value for purposes of comparison and coordination. To clarify this situation the lightning and insulator subcommittee of the A.I.E.E. power transmission and distribution committee has conducted a study, the results of which are reported in this article. In this report the committee: outlines the present status of impulse voltage characteristic data for insulation; recommends a set of preferred test waves for laboratory use, discussing the use of these waves and test procedure with a view to obtaining comparable and coordinated characteristics of insulation; points out some of the limitations in securing impulse voltage characteristic data, and in the effective use of this data; and indicates the necessity for obtaining impulse data on a logical, accurate, and common basis, pointing out the benefits to be derived therefrom."
"The field data for 1931 and 1932 are reviewed, with especial reference to lightning stroke currents. When direct strokes take place to towers or ground wires, flashover occurs if the product of current and tower footing resistance is higher than the fiashover strength of the insulators. Flashover seldom occurs if ground wires are present and the towers have low footing resistance. Three years' records on four systems indicate tower currents varying from 1,000 to 150,000 amperes. Tripouts correlate almost exclusively with high tower leg currents of negative polarity, that is, the tower top is negative with respect to the base. This indicates that the severe lightning strokes come from negatively charged clouds. A great amount of experimental data, relating to flashover between electrodes of dissimilar shapes, are shown to be in accord with these field observations."
"This paper, which is a continuation of a four-year operating record of an extensive 132-kv transmission system under lightning conditions, presents and discusses the record for 1930 and 1931. Operating experience is given on: 1. Yearly line outages due to lightning for all lines. 2. Severity and frequency of lightning storms over the system for a three-year period. 3. Frequency of double circuit outages. 4. Extent of line and station apparatus damage. 5. Effect of tower footing resistance in reducing lightning outages. 6. Reduction in tower footing resistances by the use of driven ground rods and counterpoises. 7. Effect on lightning outages by overinsulation. 8. Relative frequency of single-phase, two-phase and three-phase line faults. 9. Location of lightning flashovers on the line in reference to top, middle and bottom conductors. Conclusions are drawn from the results of the operating experience on these lines."
"This paper presents the results of a series of laboratory tests made with a million volt surge generator and 60-cycle high-voltage testing equipment on unit pole transmission construction now in standard usage on a large 26-kv transmission system. Actual impulse curves are given for several types of straight span pole top construction. Basic values of impulse flashovers are presented which should facilitate coordination of impulse insulation between poles of any similar transmission lines, aid in applying protective gaps, and furnish a guide to the comparative impulse strength of both present and new types of construction. Defects in present design standards and possible improvements are discussed. An analysis of the factors governing the development of a power arc following impulse sparkover and corresponding experimental data showing the extent of occurrence of such arcs are presented. The paper concludes that reliance upon air or wood separations within the usual physical limits to prevent lightning outages will be unsatisfactory, and discusses the application of protective measures."
"Operating experience with a large number of lines of various types, utilizing wood as lightning insulation, has demonstrated that ordinary woods have considerable insulation strength for lightning voltages, and that wood can be used to advantage in combination with other measures for improving the lightning performance of lines. The analyses have contributed materially to the present general conclusion that lightning strokes terminating on conductors and structures are responsible for the majority of lightning flashovers, at least on the higher-voltage lines; also that direct strokes must and can be coped with. The methods offering the greatest promise at present are; (1) diverting the lightning strokes from the conductors and conducting the lightning currents to earth without permitting flashover to the power conductors; (2) draining the lightning from the power conductors through fast operating dynamic follow current interrupting devices, thus avoiding insulator flashovers; and (3), a combination of these two methods. High lightning insulations alone are not generally effective in reducing the number of lightning tripouts of lines, though in the lower-voltage ranges, some decrease in the probability of dynamic current following the lightning arcs may be realized."
"A brief description is given of impulse generators and the discharge circuit constants involved in obtaining impulse voltages of the desired wave shapes. The relative influences of these constants are recognized and simplified discharge circuits are given. The variations in the wave shape and the reasons for the differences in sparkover values obtained with the three test waves, ½/5, 1/10 and 1½/40, are discussed. The degree of accuracy of the sphere gap for use in measuring impulse voltages is outlined. The resistance-capacitance and the resistance-cable voltage dividers for the connection of the cathode ray oscillograph are described and their operation analyzed in detail. Both dividers are shown to be satisfactory when properly arranged. Data are given showing that the same kilovolts per millimeter on the oscillogram for widely different wave shapes can be obtained. A specimen table for recording of complete test data is suggested which, it is thought, will tend to eliminate a lack of uniformity and completeness in data previously reported."
"With the application of surge tests to high voltage electrical apparatus, the question of the measurement of high-surge voltages has become a subject of prime importance. It is accordingly desired in Part I to show the practical work done in the laboratory at Sharon to calibrate the measuring devices, and in Part II to study the more interesting fundamental relationships that affect the operation and accuracy of these measuring devices. The methods of voltage measurement used are the resistance potentiometer, capacity potentiometer, and sphere gap. The potentiometers serve as dividers of the high-surge voltages for measurement at the cathode-ray oscillograph. The resistance potentiometer is a fundamental standard but requires consideration of its limitations for very rapid phenomena. In cases where these can be compensated for or are negligible, the resistance potentiometer method is very desirable. The capacity potentiometer is a secondary standard which can be calibrated. If corona and oscillations can be eliminated, it is a very desirable method of measurement, inasmuch as it is less subject to distorting the wave shape of the surge. The sphere gap is useful as a secondary standard for occasional check measurements, and it is of interest that formulas derived from smaller gaps still hold, as indicated by the check between the calculated curve for the 200-cm sphere gap and the calibration points with the resistance potentiometer."
"The demand for continuity of service to customers, together with the need to reduce maintenance costs, and increase the safety to operators and property, has made it necessary to improve the protective devices used in the distribution circuit. In the past, this protection has been provided by knife switches and fuses. Limited interrupting capacity of knife switches, together with the possibility of abuse of the fuse, has made it impossible to obtain these desirable characteristics. Increase in design knowledge, the development of new materials, together with an increase in knowledge of arc phenomena, and of arc interrupters has made possible the construction of circuit breakers occupying small space. These same devices are capable of rendering performance superior to that given by older apparatus. At the same time, low cost to the user is obtained, together with safer and more satisfactory service. Safety construction of apparatus, together with tests of unusual severity, assure a product capable of providing a degree of protection to property and life which is considerably more than that obtained from knife switches and fuses, which in many cases can be tampered with and handled while the circuit is alive. The new circuit breakers are suitable for very broad application in all varieties of distribution circuits within the scope of their rating. Standardization of dimensions provides for economical application."
"In the past, there have been many operating data taken and used in the comparison of the characteristics of various types of prime movers. However, there has never been a method established for the comparison of these equipments on a common basis. In this paper, such a method has been proposed. Although it deals only with internal combustion engine direct-current electric drives, with varying electrical characteristics, this method may be advantageously used for the comparison of other types of prime movers."
"This paper outlines the fundamentals of a method of obtaining overall protection of transmission lines by a comparison of the relative direction of fault current flow at the line ends by means of a communication system. The results obtained are equivalent to differential protection. The carrier-current pilot or d-c pilot wire schemes which have been introduced during the past few years are applications of this method. The optional use of a communication system to link the trip circuits at the ends of a transmission line provided with any conventional form of relay protection is described. This insures the simultaneous tripping of both line ends for all fault positions. The various types of communication systems adaptable for relay purposes are described and discussed in regard to coordination with the telephonic communication, telemetering or supervisory control systems employed as adjuncts of the power system."
"The Relay Subcommittee of the Protective Devices Committee herewith submits its recommendations for the protection of electrical apparatus. These recommendations are based upon a questionnaire and the thirty-seven replies thereto from specialists in this line. The answers were interpreted and codified by a group of twenty experienced engineers particularly interested in the protection of electrical apparatus and circuits. It is hoped that this consensus of the present-day opinion will be the beginning of a series that will be augmented and improved with each periodic analysis and reissue."
"The authors present an improved network relaying system utilizing a conventional single-phase relaying element and contactor type overcurrent elements excited by symmetrical phase sequence components to represent completely power flow conditions and control protector operation on a threephase four-wire secondary network system. The low-voltage alternating-current network was conceived and developed to meet the need for an alternating-current system of distribution that would provide high quality service and compete with the direct- current system in reliability and economy. In its present form, it consists of a distribution network, served by a plurality of feeders, with intermediate voltage transformation and network protectors. The use of the present arrangement dates from the development of the network protector which fulfilled several functions and may be described as a means to connect and disconnect each of the feeders to the network under proper conditions. The protector consists of a circuit breaker and necessary operating relays located in each of the feeds to the network. Each main feeder provides a multiplicity of feeds to the network through low-capacity transformers, (50 to 1,000 kva) and it is the function of the protector to connect to or disconnect from the feed to the network under proper conditions. For discussion of this paper see page 626."
"Protectors on many of today's low-voltage distribution networks operate needlessly several thousands of times each year due to current reversals caused by regenerative loads and difference in loading at various points in the network. Such reversals can be permitted without tripping the protectors and yet maintain a desirable selective tripping characteristic by use of a phase sequence scheme of relaying devised by Messrs. H.R. Searing and R.E. Powers (\"Application of Phase Sequence Principles\"). It employs the fact that practically all power reversals, other than fault conditions, are inherently balanced and that operation of a directional relay can be easily initiated by simple switching operations which draw negative phase sequence currents from the network. The sequence relay which has been designed in accordance with their theory, and described in this paper, performs the dual function of phasing and tripping. Its operating characteristics are suited to application on low-voltage distribution systems in general."

"The optimum steam pressure and temperature for steam-electric generating stations has not been determined. Because of the importance of the subject to the electrical industry, it has been considered worth while to present a resume of what has been accomplished with comments of such a nature as to provoke helpful discussion."

"In reference to the C.G.S. magnetic units, a brief historical outline is presented of the actions taken by international electrical congresses from 1893 to 1904, and by international technical and scientific unions from 1904 to 1932. Emphasis is laid on the results of the S.U.N. Committee meeting of July, 1932, as the latest development. The present status of international agreement on C.G.S. magnetic units is unofficially presented, in the light of the historical background. Turning to future possible developments, certain questions are pending for consideration, by either or both committees, in order to clear up any outstanding differences of international opinion over magnetic units in the classical C.G.S. system. In order to convert the existing series of practical electromagnetic units (ohm, volt, ampere, coulomb, farad, joule, watt, henry and pramaxwell) into a complete system, international agreement must first be reached upon the two outstanding questions: (a) Subrationalising (4π NI or NI for mmf). (b) The unit of length to be adopted (meter or cm). Suggestions are offered along both these lines."
"An empirical equation is derived expressing the permeability in terms of the flux density over an approximate range of 100 to 6,000 gausses. The equation is of the form; μ = Pßa and is shown to apply to a variety of magnetic materials including certain alloys. Its greatest range appears to be for silicon content electrical sheet steels. A table is given listing the values of the coefficient and exponent for magnetic materials of various grades. Several curves and tables explain the salient features of the method. An extension of the method of derivation to other parts of the magnetization curve indicates their expression by similar laws or equations. Theoretical considerations lead to an hypothesis of four phases of magnetization coupled by three transitional phases for the entire magnetization curve."
"Accurate measurements have been made of the electrical and other physical properties of 10 insulating oils, of a single grade of wood pulp paper, and of the paper when impregnated with each of the oils. Short time charge and discharge curves under continuous potential have thrown further light on the anomalous conduction as found in oils, and permit the separation of the total dielectric loss into two components. Of the total increase of the loss found in impregnated paper, over the separate losses in oil and in dry paper, one component is proportional to the effective conductivity of the oil. The other component, due to reversible absorption, is, for a given paper, a definite function of the free ion content of the oil as indicated by the product of the conductivity by the viscosity. These relations hold over the entire ranges of type of oil and temperature under study. The product of conductivity by viscosity is proposed as a measure of the ``electrical purity'' of an oil used for impregnation. The simplicity of the relations shown suggests that an extension of these studies to other grades of paper should make it possible to predict accurately, from the separate properties of paper and oil, the electrical behavior of any grade as impregnated with any type of oil."
"Variations in electrical properties of composite insulation with changes in temperature and frequency are important because they lead to concepts of physical causes of such variations and, therefore, indicate how to obtain improved electrical properties in commercial materials. Typical experimental data are presented showing the capacitance and loss characteristics of synthetic resin laminated materials and of imperfect composite dielectrics made from combinations of fused quartz or glass and semi-conducting liquids. An example is given showing agreement between calculated and observed characteristics of such a glass-liquid combination. Theoretical analyses are given, showing that the general form of the capacitance and loss characteristics could be caused by any one of several physical mechanisms. As a result of these studies it seems probable that in synthetic resin laminated products semi-conducting materials in small insulated pockets or fibers can account for observed characteristics and can be represented mathematically by the Maxwell-Wagner theory. It is also shown that capacitance and loss measurements at one frequency and temperature cannot generally be used to predict corresponding values under different conditions."
"The problem of commutation in thyratron rectifiers and inverters is discussed and a method of using a harmonic circuit of reduced kva to force commutation is described. By the aid of harmonic commutation, inverters can be operated to supply lagging loads and rectifiers can be phase controlled in the leading quadrant. A rectifier which is phase controlled 90 degrees leading becomes equivalent to a synchronous condenser and may be used for power factor correction. A duplex type of circuit is described which enables a polyphase inverter to produce a sinusoidal voltage and current, and permits a rectifier to draw a sinusoidal current from the a-c system. The inverter is shown to differ from a synchronous converter only in that the sum of the a-c and d-c armature reactions of the inverter must always be zero. By providing two sets of tubes in the inverter, one on the unity power factor axis and the other on the zero power factor axis, a crossed axis inverter is developed which will furnish a sinusoidal current and voltage for all conditions of load."

"Generators for producing essentially constant voltage when operating from a variable speed source have been developed. Two types of variable speed constant potential generators are described that obtain regulation without the use of regulators having moving parts. One type makes use of a thyrite regulator to obtain the desired characteristics. The other type is inherently self-regulating and, therefore, requires no external regulation. These generators are sufficiently flexible to allow a wide variation in their design and operating characteristics."
"Due to increased production demands, the speed at which resitance welders operate has been stepped up as much as four to five times during the last few years. This has been made possible in a large degree, by the development of new switching mechanisms that will allow a current dwell of a fraction of a cycle on a 60-cycle circuit. This increased speed of welding has made it necessary to study very carefully the design of the transformer and the shape and spacing of the secondary circuits, especially the cooling and protection of these parts. It has been necessary also to pay more attention to multi-transformer welders, where several transformers are used either for the purpose of distributing the secondary current to better advantage, or for the purpose of balancing the welder load on multi-phase circuits."
"Presents three different comments on the aboved-named work with a reply by one of the original authors (C.F. Green)."
"To assist in clarifying the present concepts of reactive power, the following introduction to the subject has been prepared. An analysis of the reactive conventions made by Doctor Silsbee, a member of the subcommittee, is included."
"In this paper the single-phase and polyphase definitions of reactive power are considered. The single-phase definition is unsatisfactory when the current and voltage wave forms are complex. The polyphase definition is the better but requires the independent recognition of the effects of distortion and, in the case of four or more wires, mesh distribution. The geometric difference between the apparent power and the power may be called the fictitious power to distinguish it from the reactive power which is only part of the fictitious power."
"This paper is written to present the point of view of the practical operating engineer to whom ``reactive power'' is something that he has to generate and deliver to his customers much as he does ordinary or real power. It happens that this kind of reactive power is the kind which causes the current to lag behind the voltage when it happens to be flowing in the same direction in the circuit as the ``active'' power. However, when it happens to be flowing in the direction opposite to that of the active power (which, in a transmission system is just about as likely to happen), it makes the total current in the circuit appear to lead the voltage and deceives the technician who observes this phenomenon into thinking that a different kind of reactive power (viz., leading reactive power) is flowing in the same direction as the active power. The paper presents an interpretation of such observations in terms of the one kind of reactive power with which the practical operation and control of power systems has to deal and points out the parallelism between active and reactive power in their operating aspects. It also presents an unorthodox metering technique for keeping track of the flow of reactive power in a complicated power transmission network which greatly clarifies and simplifies the problem of dispatching reactive power in such a system; such dispatching being necessary to obtain maximum transmission system capacity and efficiency as well as for system voltage control."
"The relation between power, reactive volt-amperes, and power factor is discussed for sinusoidal electromotive forces and currents. Reactive volt-amperes is defined as the flow of stored energy into the circuit and is deduced from the stored energy cycle. It is shown to be a cyclic flow of power which is 90 deg in advance of the cyclic part of the dissipation or power input cycle which with the stored energy cycles is positive at all instants. This leads to the vector equation ĚIĚ + ĚǏ derived for the equation of total inflow of energy given by Ri2 + d/dt (1/2Li2)or (Ri2 + L di/di i) for an inductive system or Ri2 + d/dt (1/2 q2/C) or (Ri + q/C) i for a capacitor system. Non-sinusoidal electromotive forces and currents are discussed and it is shown that there is no simple relation between the volt-amperes as obtained by voltmeters and ammeters and power as obtained by wattmeters and reactive power. The inflow of stored energy for double frequency fundamental can be obtained but it appears to bear little relation to the product of mean square volts and amperes and true average power. It is concluded that the ratio of power to mean square volt-amperes is a useful practical factor with non-sinusoidal waves encountered in practice but should not be used to define reactive volt-amperes. Polyphase power and reactive volt-amperes are defined. In a balanced system power is continuous and the instantaneous reactive volt-amperes are zero."
"In the following paper, the character of the quantity known as reactive volt-amperes is first discussed and its dependence on the assumption of a definite type of periodicity is brought out, this in contrast to certain other a-c quantities. It is pointed out that on account of the rather complicated relation that it bears to the flow of energy in an electric circuit serious difficulties are met in its measurement except in the simpler conditions of balanced voltages, in a polyphase circuit, and sinusoidal waves. Two procedures are outlined which though they are not premised on balanced voltages have frequency and wave form limitations. In the latter part of the paper, the relation of the quantity of energy that surges in an a-c circuit in which there is energy storage, to the average flow of energy is considered, and advantages of this conception as a basis for rates are indicated. Finally, it is pointed out that reactive volt-amperes is of the nature of a complementary quantity rather than a specific activity of the electric circuit which when suitably combined with power gives volt-amperes."
"This paper describes the various test methods which have been evolved during three years by The Tennessee Electric Power Company, which pioneered the use of reactance type distance relays in this country. Specific examples with diagrams are given. New considerations brought about by the use of high speed distance relays are discussed, including their adaptability to being tested by means of short circuit tests. General notes and recommendations covering short circuit tests arising from eight years' experience in making them are given together with typical examples."
"This paper presents an operating engineer's point of view of the practical and theoretical problems presented in applying relays for the protection of high voltage open wire interconnection transmission lines. It points out that the relaying of such lines involves problems which are not ordinarily present in the relaying of intra-system lines. These problems are enumerated and the extent to which modern relaying meets them is discussed. It is shown that the most satisfactory schemes are very expensive and the cheaper schemes are not entirely effective. The limitations of available schemes are discussed and their economics compared. A theoretical solution is proposed."
"A medium-speed cathode-ray oscillograph with a rotating film has been built for the study of circuit breaker transients. The film is wrapped around a drum and rotated in the vacuum at high speed. Each film shows in a continuous trace a complete story of the formation of arc, subsequent reignitions, and final extinction. More than 15 complete cycles may be recorded without excessive blurring. Each film is self-calibrated. A stutdy of several types of circuit breakers with this instrument shows that the nature of the transients at time of arc extinction varies with the type of breaker on test. Different types of breakers tested on the same circuit have different rates of rise of recovery voltage. The deionizing efficiency of a breaker influences not only the arcing time, but the transient oscillation at current zero. The influence of the deionizing efficiency of the breaker upon the stability of the decreasing arc current near current zero is studied and interesting conclusions made."
"An analysis is made of the requirements for satisfactory operation of the simple four-arm bridge when used for impedance measurements. The various forms of bridge are classified into two major types called the ratio-arm type and the product-arm type, based on the location of the fixed impedance arms in the bridge. These two types were subdivided further, based on the phase relation which exists between the fixed arm impedances. Eight practical forms of bridges are given, three of them being duplicate forms from the standpoint of the method of measuring impedance. These bridges together allow the measurement of any type of impedance in terms of practically any type of adjustable standard. The use of partial substitution methods and of resonance methods with these bridges is discussed and several methods of operation are described which show their flexibility in the measurement of impedance."
"Electrical measuring instruments play an important part in the generation, distribution, and sale of electrical power, and in the development and testing of electrical machinery. The accuracy of electrical measuring instruments depends as much on the quality of the control springs as on the design of the torque producing elements. Unstable effects found in the application of spiral springs to electrical instruments arise from aging in service and hereditary hysteresis in the spring material. There is little available information in the technical literature on these effects. In order to produce the most satisfactory spring controlled instruments for the electrical industry, there should be recorded in the technical literature a considerable body of detailed information on springs. Information is needed on such subjects as the effect of composition, condition of material, forming methods, stabilizing treatments, design details, residual stresses, service conditions, and temperature on the performance of spiral instrument springs. The information presented in this paper resulted from torsional pendulum tests, hardness tests, spring uncoiling tests, Various forming and stabilizing treatments, and measurements of hereditary hysteresis with the grid glow micrometer. The results of these tests are presented graphically, showing that moderate temperature heat treatment has an important effect on hereditary hysteresis, that the softening range of cold worked spring ribbon is very critical, that the forming temperature and forming time have a controlling effect on residual stresses, that a stress relief anneal reduces aging and hereditary hysteresis. The nature of the action of hereditary hysteresis is defined."
"This paper describes a simplified portable oscillograph having a number of new optical and electrical features. The optical system, which consists of a combination of cylindrical lenses with axes at right angles, is designed to permit simultaneous viewing and photographing. A continuous time axis for both the viewing screen and film is secured by means of a small, variable speed, revolving mirror. New galvanometers have been developed which have electromagnetic damping instead of the usual oil damping. These galvanometers are very rugged and have been built for recording frequencies as high as 14,000 cycles per sec. The oscillograph is entirely self-contained and may be operated from a 110-volt 80-cycle lighting circuit without auxiliary attachments. The compactness and portability of the instrument can be seen from its over-all dimensions which are 8 × 11½ × 11 in. and from its total weight, which is approximately 18 lb."
"The deion flashover protector is a device intended for the protection of insulation such as used on transmission lines. In operation the lightning discharge passes through the device and the resulting power arc is extinguished without causing a system disturbance. Applications must be based on the surge flashover of the insulation to be protected, the system fault current, and the voltage at which that current must be interrupted."
"This paper presents an analytical discussion of some of the important decisions reached in the design of the new Port Washington power plant. The initial section of the station will have a capacity of 80,000 kw and will utilize 1,230 lb steam pressure and 825 deg F steam temperature at the throttle and 825 deg F steam temperature at the reheat point. Summaries of certain economic studies, which formed the bases for decisions, are included, but no statistical information on the various pieces of equipment."
"The paper presents the results of a photographic study of successive steps in the kindling process of impulse sparkover in unsymmetrical dielectric fields. The photographs confirm the theory, established by the bending of the electric figure streamers when formed under stress of the magnetic field, that electrons primarily are the active elements in the kindling mechanism. The figures also indicate that in a field of ionizing potential gradient the bridging of the spark-gap (10.5 cm) is due largely to extension of the streamers or channels from the positive electrode; and that space charges affect the impulse-sparkover process."
"A previous paper on a-c arcs in air between copper electrodes showed the influence of circuit constants in determining the rise of voltage across the electrodes during the reignition period of cyclic current zero. This paper gives the distribution of potential throughout the arc space between the electrodes during the reignition period, and shows that during that time the potential drop is concentrated largely in the space adjacent to the cathode, the major portion of the arc space is free from potential gradient, and the potential distribution is measurable with fidelity by means of inserted probes."
"This paper presents solutions of practical operating problems of primary networks under normal and abnormal conditions. The general principles involved in network design are established. Charts are given which show in terms of elementary network data the load distribution in the network under various emergency conditions. Three simple equations involving only well known system constants are given which will enable the distribution engineer to determine the proper setting of the compensator and contact-making voltmeter to insure (1) that circulating currents shall be reduced to a minimum, (2) that overcompounding to secure proper voltage regulation shall be adequate, and (3) that any normal unbalance in load shall be reduced to a minimum. Other practical problems are discussed and answered. An exact mathematical analysis of the general regulated network is given in the Appendix. This analysis is broad in scope and has evident applications other than the particular one with respect to primary networks as considered here. The paper has been written to meet the requirements of operating engineers responsible for system networks. The results given here are substantiated by theoretical calculations, calculating board analyses and test data on actual systems in operation, and cover all practical conditions of steady state operation. A subsequent paper will consider the primary network problems involved in short-circuit and relay studies."

"The calculation of the alternating torque developed on single-phase short circuit has been discussed by previous authors.1,7 This paper extends the analysis of the electrical torque on short circuit to cover the transient torques due to losses, which although not so large as the alternating torques may be the most serious factor in the effects of short-circuit torques. The resulting mechanical torques in the various parts of the machine are analyzed, and some important conclusions reached: (1) That a rigid stator transmits all the electrical torque developed; while the shaft and coupling of a coupled set, or the springs in a spring-mounted stator in general need transmit only a fraction of the alternating components. The greater part of the alternating components of the electrical torque are absorbed by the inertias involved, when the natural frequency of torsional oscillation is below the rated frequency. This is the case always for spring-mounted stators, and almost always the case for coupled rotors. (2) That the sudden increase in torque on short-circuit conditions determined by losses in the negative sequence resistance (mainly the rotor losses) or in the resistance of the external circuit, may produce higher mechanical torques in shafts and couplings than the alternating components of the electrical torque. (3) That there are other transient conditions which may produce more serious mechanical torques than sudden short circuit."
"This paper gives data on the voltage and current wave shape of mercury arc rectifiers on both the d-c and a-c side. The values of the harmonics at light load are considered first and the modifications of the harmonics under load due to impedance then are studied. The results of tests on rectifiers are given and are in reasonable agreement with the theoretical values which, for convenience in use, are plotted in the form of curves. The relation between the harmonics in rectifiers with different transformer connections is shown and consideration also is given to modifications introduced when the a-c voltage contains harmonics or has a phase unbalance. A brief discussion is given of some methods of modifying the harmonic voltages in this type of apparatus."
"Although the design of so-called standard resistance welders is more or less fixed, the construction of a special resistance welding machine involves a series of design factors which are only approximate and for which one allows large limits. An attempt is made to outline the elementary features of construction for successful operation by enumerating the factors which must be known. A method of obtaining the proper transformer capacity, types of switches for changing the amount of welding current, and means for regulating the time of application of the current are indicated. Important mechanical conditions to be considered are also touched upon. This is followed by a description of the construction features of a few outstanding resistance welding machines of special design used at the Hawthorne Plant of the Western Electric Company. Although most of these machines are of relatively small total current capacities, the current densities used are quite high. The machines described are used for welding precious metal contacts, permalloy wire, bronze brushes, switchboard plug parts and copper rod."
"Long time overvoltage tests on oil treated cable samples and short time and impulse tests on oil treated paper sheet samples indicate that an increase in the hydrostatic pressure of the oil will result in an increase in the breakdown voltage. The magnitude of this increase depends on the time duration of the test. A doubling of breakdown voltage was secured by a pressure increase from 1 to 6 atmospheres in the case of the long time (several weeks) while no improvement at all was secured in the case of the impulse tests (several microseconds duration) by a pressure increase up to 11 atmospheres."
"Experience in recent years with underground cable for the higher operating voltages has developed the fact that specifications for the insulation were incomplete and inadequate, because some of its properties which were of slight importance for the lower operating voltages became of vital importance in cable for the higher voltages. Tests on impregnated paper insulation of the ordinary type as made at the factory heretofore have determined the quality of the insulation at the time of making the tests, but gave little indication of the rate or extent of the deterioration that might occur in service. When the Commonwealth Edison Company, Chicago, Ill., adopted 66-kv cable for tie lines between generating stations so that the cable practically formed a high voltage bus, it became very important that the cable should be reasonably free from failures in service. Unfortunately the cable included in thefirst installation in 1926 fell below this requirement, and some of it had to be replaced within a few years. A careful comparison of test and service records of the four makes of cable installed in 1926 showed that the cable had a wide range in quality. A marked difference was noted in the behavior of practically identical cable on a line heavily loaded and on a line moderately loaded. Accordingly, a series of tests was undertaken with the object of developing in a short time the deterioration which had been found in the several cables in service."
"Investigation of the radial variation in electrical and chemical characteristics of cable insulation between conductor and sheath is suggested as a valuable means for throwing new light on cable'deterioration in service. An apparatus is described for the rapid accurate measurement of power factor of individual paper tapes taken from cable. A method is given for determining the total oxidation products in the oil from the paper tapes, layer by layer, from sheath to conductor. The results obtained by applying these methods to several types of service aged cable are reported, together with the indications which they give of the relative importance of ionization and oxidation as aging factors."
"In order to meet future demands for high grade and economical circuits in cables, considerable carrier development work has been done which has included an extensive experimental installation on a 25-mile loop of underground cable. Sufficient pairs were provided in the cable and repeaters were installed to set up nine carrier telephone circuits 850 miles long. Tests on these circuits showed the quality of transmission to be satisfactory, while the methods and devices adopted to prevent interference between them were found to be adequate. The trial therefore has demonstrated that the obtaining of large numbers of carrier telephone circuits from cable is a practicable proposition. This paper is devoted largely to a description of the trial installation and an account of the experimental work which has been done in this connection. Due to present business conditions, it is expected that this method will not have immediate commercial application. This work is part of a general investigation of transmission systems which are characterized by the fact that each electrical path transmits a broad band of frequencies. Such systems offer important possibilities of economy particularly for routes carrying heavy traffic. The conducting circuit is non-loaded so that the velocity of transmission is much higher than present voice-frequency loaded cable circuits. This is particularly important for very long circuits where transmission delays tend to introduce serious difficulties."
"Development of the power resources of that portion of the St. Lawrence River which forms part of the boundary between the United States and Canada, for many years has been studied by engineers and talked by politicians; and neither the end of the discussion nor the start of construction is yet in sight. Equal in magnitude of power output, but not of expenditure, is the Beauharnois development of the Soulanges section of this same river, a wholly Canadian enterprise, the initial installation of which is now in operation. The power canal of this development will form an integral part of the proposed St. Lawrence waterway. This paper describes the project as a whole in a general way and presents in more detail the principal features of the electrical installation."
"At sedentary occupations under normal indoor winter conditions the human body loses heat at the rate of 400 Btu per hour, of which approximately 46 per cent is radiated, 30 per cent is convected, and 24 per cent is lost by the evaporation of moisture from skin and lungs. The skin and clothing surface temperatures average about 80 deg F. With solid surroundings at 80 deg F, therefore, no heat would be lost by radiation. Any intermediate temperature between the normally prevailing inside wall temperature and 80 deg F would mean a corresponding modification in the amount of heat radiated. Compensation for this decrease in radiated heat may be effected by lowering the air temperature. The effect on human comfort of thus controlling the amount of heat radiated from the body is discussed in this paper. The possibility of using electric energy for this application, together with equipment and operating costs, also is discussed."
"An improved design of section for the sectional mercury arc rectifier is described, together with the manner of assembling into the sectional unit.

Performance characteristics, which incluide arc voltage curves, determined from both laboratory tests and operating service are given. Factors determining design features are discussed."

"The engineer who aspires to solve modern economic problems by applying his well tried scientific methods, should take thought of the limitations of those methods; he must expect to do an unusual amount of studying before he can hope to replace old economic theories with others better suited to present conditions; and because of the capricious nature of the many variables involved, he should not attempt to predict future trends on the basis of past experience."
"The results of a year's survey of transmission conditions between New York and Buenos Aires in the short-wave radio spectrum show that frequencies between 19 and 23 megacycles were best for daytime transmission, and those between 8 and 10 megacycles for nighttime transmission. A transition frequency was required in the early morning, but the useful periods of the day and night frequencies overlapped in the evening. No variations that could definitely be traced to a seasonal effect was found."

"Methods of metering the positive and negative sequence power and energy in 3-phase 3-wire systems, and positive, negative, and zero sequence power and energy in 3-phase 4-wire systems, are discussed in this article. It is presented not because it contains a wealth of new material, but because it deals comprehensively with the problem, in a way different from that which has prevailed in earlier published material, and because it is clear, specific, and readily understandable, confining itself strictly to the problem of metering of symmetrical components."

"Distribution of alternating current at low voltages requires careful consideration of the various factors influencing voltage regulation. In order to keep the regulation as nearly constant as possible over a range of currents and power factors, certain optimum ratios of circuit resistance to reactance are desirable. Studies presented in this article have been made to facilitate the selection of these ratios. Cost data for various circuit arrangements also are given."
"Cables connected directly to overhead transmission lines may require protection against lightning. The factors which determine whether or not protective equipment is necessary are discussed in this article and new and simplified formulas for determining the maximum voltage are presented.

"Energy from the Safe Harbor Hydroelectric Plant is received at Baltimore at a new substation near the Westport steam generating station. At this substation the 230-kv energy is stepped down to 33 kv at which voltage it is transmitted to the 13-kv Westport substation and to the Gould Street steam generating station. The 230-kv energy is stepped down at Westport through a bank of 126,000-kva surge-proof transformers."
"This article presents a practicable and comparatively simple means of determining the ability of an electric power transmission system to withstand any type of short circuit at any single point of the system without losing synchronism. The method is one that enables an engineer without much special training in handling stability problems to obtain quite accurate solutions with a reasonable expenditure of time."
"CHICAGO during Engineers' Week, June 26–30,1933, at the Century of Progress International Exposition, was marked by a predominance of technologists, particularly around the leading hotels where congregated the several thousand individuals attempting to attend one or more of the several technical and scientific conclaves. The many delegates and visitors present from various nations throughout the world created also a distinctly international atmosphere, and brought into the sessions some points of view not usually available."
"Wednesday, June 28, 1933, was designated officially by the Century of Progress International Exposition as its Engineers' Day. Hundreds of those attending the many engineering and scientific conclaves held in Chicago that week gathered Wednesday morning in the south end of the stadium at Soldiers Field, where one of the 2 joint engineering events of the day was held."

"Signs seem unmistakably to indicate that the present upheaval in the social, political, and economic life of the United States will be as far-reaching as those following the Revolution and the Civil War.

"Electric power transmission lines employing ordinary pin type insulators may cause radio interference although otherwise in good operating condition. With more than 13/000/000 radio receiving sets in the United States the seriousness of this problem is at once apparent. Accordingly, several manufacturers have developed insulators that are claimed to be free from interference at their rated operating voltages. In this article comparative tests on some of these insulators are described and the relative merits of the different designs are pointed out."

It is expected to issue the revised editions in the near future."
"In a 457-page book entitled “The Alloys of Iron and Silicon,” a comprehensive review and a critical appraisal of the known facts on the alloys of iron and silicon, and on the effects of silicon on steel and special cast iron, are given. This monograph has been prepared by Alloys of Iron Research, which was organized late in 1929 by The Engineering Foundation, research organization of the 4 national societies of civil, mining and metallurgical, mechanical, and electrical engineers. Alloys of Iron Research was organized after 3 years of preliminary activities, to review and appraise critically all of the research on iron and its alloys reported in the technical literature of the world. The work has progressed to the stage where most of the important journals in English, German, French, and Swedish, from 1892 to date, have been gone over thoroughly, and all data of importance abstracted and classified. The files now contain more than 12,000 critical abstracts, from nearly 5,000 technical papers. These are being reviewed primarily to use as a basis for a series of monographs on alloys of the element iron with 38 of the 92 chemical elements. The first monograph, “The Alloys of Iron and Molybdenum,” was published in December 1932. The second volume of this series, “The Alloys of Iron and Silicon,” now is available. A critical résumé of all data on steel and cast iron containing silicon as an important alloy is included in this book. A summary of the types of alloys discussed in the book follows."

"Many years ago the need for public regulation of public utilities was recognized. As these natural monopolies increased in number and in scope, regulatory powers, which at first were exercised by legislative bodies, gradually were delegated to specially appointed commissions until now there are about 50 such bodies in the United States. Engineers employed by these commissions should have not only a technical education, but also a knowledge of construction, operating, accounting, and commercial problems and procedures."
"What is said to be the first commercial application of radiotelephone communication on ultra short wave lengths is to be placed in operation between Lympne, England, and St. Inglevert, France. Some facts concerning the methods of producing these oscillations are presented herewith."
"In the following 2 articles, recent progress in noise measurement and its standardization is outlined. In the first, P. L. Alger, chairman of the A.I.E.E. committee on sound, points out the practical significance of preliminary standards for noise measurements approved June 26, 1933, by the American Standards Association, and indicates the lines of further progress required to bring noise measurements into general use. In the second article, Harvey Fletcher, chairman of the A.S.A. sectional committee on acoustical measurements, presents the formal report of that committee which contains the proposed standards and a résumé of pertinent discussion thereon. These standards provide a universal language for sound measurements in general, and a foundation for future standards of noise meter calibration and apparatus noise measurements. Members of the Institute are urged to review these new possibilities in sound measurement and to put them into practical use. Comments and criticisms of the proposed standards are solicited by the committees."
"THE INITIAL STANDARDS of acoustic measurements, presented by Doctor Fletcher in the article following this one, form a milestone of progress which deserves attention. They create a universal language in which distant observers can communicate and preserve the results of their investigations. They permit engineers to evaluate numerically the noise performance of machines of varied designs. Ultimately they will give to the public a means for translating its now vague desire for quiet into concrete legal and commercial terms."
"THE PROPOSED STANDARDS and definitions given in this article were approved on June 26, 1933 by the sectional committee on acoustical measurements of the American Standards Association. They now are being circulated widely to secure criticism and suggestion and will be reconsidered in light of the comments received. It is for this reason that they were presented before the A.I.E.E. at the 1933 summer convention held in Chicago, Ill., and are being published now in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING."
"Although the expansion of electric power transmission and distribution systems has been curtailed greatly during the past year, some unusual cable installations have been made. These and other advances are outlined briefly in this report by the Institute's committee on power transmission and distribution."
"Steam turbines must be judged not only upon their original characteristics, but also upon the permanence of these characteristics and the reliability of operation over a period of years. Some of the factors affecting reliability and permanence of performance of modern steam turbines are discussed in this article, and several recently developed methods of maintaining efficiencies are given."
"Theory of probability has found many applications, some of a practical nature, others less elementary such as in the development of statistical theories of matter. There is a mathematical theory of probability, the rules of operation of which are generally acceptable and lead to results of increasing scientific and economic significance; however, the theory still is considered to rest upon an unsatisfactory philosophical basis. This article presents a brief outline of the history of probability theory and more detailed discussions of present concepts."

Tests under practical operating conditions now are being made on a 210-mile electrified portion of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific Railroad. This paper discusses briefly the general problem of trolley wire lubrication, and presents results of tests on both graphite-grease and solid lubricant."
"A “short-circuit current solution” for calculating the currents and voltages in an electrical network has recently been discovered. It is applicable to both d-c and a-c circuits, and reduces the labor of calculations considerably."
"THE navigation of airplanes in fog or under conditions of low visibility is becoming more and more dependent upon the use of directional radio devices. As used in the United States, directional radio equipment takes 2 forms: (a) the directive range beacon used on the established airways, requiring no directional radio equipment on the airplanes using the service, and (b) the direction finder, used on airplanes engaged in cross-country flying independent of the airways. The use of the direction finder on airplanes has not been extensive. There has, however, been increasing demand for a direction finder designed specifically for airplane use. The U.S. Bureau of Standards, in its capacity as the research division of the aeronautics branch of the department of commerce, has developed a simple direction finder for this purpose. The following description is quoted in full from U.S. Bureau of Standards Technical News Bulletin for August 1933. p. 83–4."
"This paper presents methods for determining steady state power limits of electric power systems composed of shunt impedance loads and any number of ideal cylindrical-rotor synchronous machines. In order to apply these methods to practical systems, the actual machines are represented by equivalent ideal machines corresponding to a given operating condition. The methods are said to be simpler and easier to apply than previous methods."
"Composite loads and induction machines are included in the study of steady state stability characteristics of power systems reported in this paper. Reactive power characteristics must be considered when induction machines are involved, in addition to the real power characteristics which are considered for synchronous machine groups. A determination of the synchronizing power coefficients under various operating conditions, as described herein, provides a comparatively simple method of determining the safe and dangerous regions of steady state operation."
"THE PURPOSE of this article is to explain some of the details of procedure involved in the handling of technical papers and special manuscripts under the new unified and enlarged publication program sponsored by the publication committee and adopted by the Institute's board of directors August 8, 1933.

"To test the ability of the “total noise” meter to give proper relative ratings for complex sounds of about the same level, but of materially different quality, a series of tests has been made wherein the noise measurements were compared directly with observers' judgments of loudness. The results showed surprisingly close agreement between the meter readings and the average judgments of a group of observers. The results show also the superiority of noise meter readings over the judgment of any single observer."
"Electric filters are used to prevent only currents which are in a desired frequency range from passing through a circuit. Changes in magnitudes and phase relations of the currents passing through a filter occur, and these changes are different for different frequencies. By means of the mechanical analogy described in this article, the action of currents in a filter may be observed and clearly understood."
"The characteristics and design of the relaxation inverter, which requires only one tube for obtaining alternating current from a d-c supply, are described in this article. This inverter is simple and reliable and can be made to provide alternating voltage having a good wave form."
"Important features that should be considered in designing transformers for supplying power to electric furnaces, are pointed out in this paper. The extremely high secondary currents and low secondary voltages, together with the wide variation in voltage required by many furnaces, demand special design considerations in both the transformer and its associated equipment."
"A study of the connections and methods of operation of the Long Beach steam plant No. 3, part of the system of the Southern California Edison Company Ltd. gives considerable information on desirable methods of switching at modern large generating plants. This paper, part of a symposium on switching at modern large generating plants, presents the problems for one plant."
"Fundamental economic factors involved in the design of systems for delivering electric energy to typical urban load areas are discussed and analyzed in this paper. The fundamental principles presented already have been applied in a practical way in the design of a radial system recently built in Buffalo, N. Y. Engineering studies upon which the selection of that system was based led to the conclusion that for areas of load densities too low to justify a low voltage network, a properly designed radial system is likely to be the most economical and satisfactory system."
"The 3-phase electric arc furnace has established itself definitely as an important industrial unit in the production of ferrous materials. With the efficiency of the arc furnace being increased, and with the overall cost of installation and operation now being comparable with that of an equivalent open hearth, an even more extensive application is indicated for the future. This paper discusses in a general way the classification, rating, and methods of operation of 3-phase arc furnaces, outlines some of the modern developments in design, and points out the relative advantages of these units in specific applications."
"Carbon and graphite electrodes play an important part in many industries; the number of uses of these electrodes is increasing year by year, and the field of application is widening. In spite of these facts, however, published information regarding them appears to be quite meager. In this paper the history of carbon and graphite electrodes is outlined briefly, and the methods of manufacture and industrial applications are described."
"The power Selsyn unit, an adaptation of the wound rotor induction motor, provides accurate remote control of angular motion, using only an electrical connection. The characteristics of these units are described briefly in this paper, and methods of calculating their performance are offered. Typical applications of Selsyn drives also are given."
"A sequel to an earlier paper by Carroll and Cozzens concerning corona loss measurements for the design of transmission lines, this paper presents data resulting from comparative tests on 6 different designs of 1.4-in. conductor, the size selected for a 275-kv transmission line from Boulder Dam to Los Angeles. Data covers 3-phase, single-phase, and rain tests, and adds materially to the corona loss data previously reported."
"This paper treats the loci of potential difference across the midpoints of a 4-arm network with constant coefficients and constant applied voltage. When the network is operated at constant frequency and any one of its arms varies along one of its components or at constant phase angle, the locus of potential difference is a circle. When the network arms remain fixed and the frequency is varied, the locus may or may not be a single circle and in many instances may be expressed as the sum of 2 circles or a circle and a bicircular quartic. To illustrate the practical application of this work, the analytical treatment and numerical results are given for typical networks."
"Part of a symposium on switching at modern large generating plants, this paper includes a description of the switching facilities at the Hudson Avenue station of the Brooklyn (N. Y.) Edison Company. Operating experience obtained with the connections and equipment used also is given."
"The conventional theory explaining the attenuation and distortion of traveling waves is not adequate to explain many peculiarities found to exist in such waves. In this paper there is developed a multi-conductor multi-velocity theory of traveling waves which more completely explains wave behavior. The conventional traveling wave theory is shown to be a special case of this more general theory."
"A method of maintaining constant voltage at the load center of a transmission system, utilizing load ratio control equipment in combination with fixed capacitors, is described in this paper. This method combines the desirable performance characteristics of both the synchronous condenser and load ratio control methods, and in some cases results in appreciable savings in overall system losses."
"A plan has been developed for joint occupancy of poles by power and telephone circuits in the Staten Island, N. Y., area, involving 6,900-volt distribution. The aim of this plan is to secure to the public and to the power and telephone companies overall safety, convenience, and economy. Results of this cooperative study of joint use are presented in this paper."
"Measurements of impedance made on 5 sizes of rails and on 2 types of bonds are reported in this paper; the investigation covered a range of current per rail of 20 to 900 amp, and frequencies of 15 to 60 cycles per second. Results are given in a form convenient for engineering use, and include information for applying corrections for bond impedance and for temperature."
"Counterpoises are recommended for protecting electric power transmission lines against damage from lightning surges where other methods do not reduce the tower footing surge impedance to the desired level. In this paper a physical explanation of the theory of counterpoises is given together with an analytical solution of parallel counterpoise problems. Of the 2 types studied, the parallel counterpoise is shown to be the more effective."
"This brief survey of the work done during 1932 and 1933 in the field of liquid dielectric research indicates the scope and importance of that work and reflects some of the high lights from recent literature."
"A brief survey of improvements in impregnated paper cable insulation as revealed by operating records of the Commonwealth Edison Company, Chicago, covering a period of 14 years is given here. Tangible savings resulting from improved insulation are shown to appear importantly in the dollars-and-cents columns of the operating records."
"This brief survey of some of the important work done during the past year in the field of solid dielectrics, touches upon the evolution of the pyroelectric theory of breakdown and recounts some of the significant developments in modern rubbers. Other high lights are reflected from recent literature."
"THE technical program for the forthcoming winter convention of the A.I.E.E. to be held in the Engineering Societies Building, 33 West 39th Street, New York, N. Y., during the 4 days of January 23–26, 1934, is being prepared as usual to present to the engineering profession the most recent developments in electrical engineering, and to lay the groundwork for future trends. The technical program tentatively arranged for this convention is presented herein."
"THE question of whether the Institute should or should not accept for formal presentation and publication technical papers prepared by and bearing the signature of nonmembers of the Institute has been seriously considered by the Institute's technical program and other committees, as well as by its board of directors. Inasmuch as the Institute's policy with regard to nonmember authors has been tightened materially during the past year, and inasmuch as this policy is scheduled for rigorous enforcement toward the general exclusion of papers by non-member authors, a brief review and explanation of the whole situation is presented herewith in order that this important matter may be generally and clearly understood throughout the membership of the Institute."
"IN view of the fact that the 50th anniversary of the founding of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers occurs May 13, 1934, the Institute's board of directors at its meeting October 20, 1933, considered recommendations made by the publication committee and by the committee on coordination of Institute activities for a fitting observance of that anniversary. Accordingly, the board authorized and provided for the issuance of a special anniversary issue of ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING for May 1934, and authorized the president to appoint a special 50th anniversary committee to plan the celebration and to cooperate with the publication committee."
"INTEREST at the meeting of the Middle Atlantic States Section of the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education held at Cooper Union in New York, N. Y., November 11, 1933, centered on the Engineers' Council for Professional Development, which, as announced in the last 2 issues of ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, is now being actively brought before the engineers of the United States."
"AUTHORS who plan to present papers before the Institute during the calendar year 1934, those who have presented papers during 1933, and others who may wish to submit papers for prizes, would do well to bear in mind that such papers are eligible for consideration for Institute prizes. These awards are made each spring for the preceding calendar year, and fall into 2 main classes, national and District prizes."
"UNEMPLOYMENT relief being carried on in the metropolitan area of New York, N. Y., by the Professional Engineers Committee on Unemployment, known locally as the P.E.C.U., is worthy of national attention as it affords a guide to similar work which has been and may be carried on in other sections of the country. A summary of this work for the year ending October 1, 1933, therefore is presented herewith, similar to that for the previous year given in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING for November 1932, p. 809–13. At the end of the present report, a proposed plan for extending employment of engineers is given."
"CONTRIBUTIONS to these columns are invited from Institute members and subscribers. They should be concise and may deal with technical papers, articles published in previous issues, or other subjects of some general interest and professional importance. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING will endeavor to publish as many letters as possible, but of necessity reserves the right to publish them in whole or in part, or to reject them entirely."
"The board of examiners, at its recent meeting recommended the members listed for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objection to these transfers should be filed at once with the national secretary."
"This index covers all technical items that appeared in this periodical during the year."
"Presents the front cover for this issue of the publication."
"Presents the front inside cover for this issue of the publication."
"Presents the table of contents for this issue of the periodical."
"Here is given a résumé of the accomplishments to date in the long-continued efforts toward ever-improved operating economy in steam-electric generating stations. Facts seem to indicate that the engineers of the future will meet the challenge of past accomplishments by building stations of still higher fuel economy and still lower cost per unit of capacity."
"The transformer subcommittee of the A.I.E.E. electrical machinery committee presents herewith a progress report covering its work to date on the impulse voltage testing of commercial electric power transformers. A tentative test procedure has been agreed upon, although complete agreement has not yet been reached on all details. It is hoped that this report will stimulate among members of the Institute discussion that will be helpful to the committee in completing a formal test code during the coming year."
"Typical communication requirements of a large American steam railroad system are outlined briefly in this article. Large railroad systems are complex organizations requiring extensive communication services to handle their special operating problems and to enable them to reach and serve the public adequately. Brief descriptions of the major requirements for circuits, switchboards, radio, carrier, plant, and apparatus are given."
"Extensive tests have demonstrated important advantages favoring the use of high frequency current for electric arc welding and have led to the development of a 900-cycle double induction generator of attractive characteristics and capable of supplying several different arcs at once. Some test results and a description of the high frequency generator are given."
"Much of the data on impulse voltage testing of insulators and insulation which has been given out in the past has been obtained on a basis that renders it of little value for purposes of comparison and coordination. To clarify this situation the lightning and insulator subcommittee of the A.I.E.E. power transmission and distribution committee has conducted a study, the results of which are reported in this article. In this report the committee: outlines the present status of impulse voltage characteristic data for insulation; recommends a set of preferred test waves for laboratory use, discussing the use of these waves and test procedure with a view to obtaining comparable and coordinated characteristics of insulation; points out some of the limitations in securing impulse voltage characteristic data, and in the effective use of this data; and indicates the necessity for obtaining impulse data on a logical, accurate, and common basis, pointing out the benefits to be derived therefrom."
"This is a distinctly “different” type of discussion of a study of the economic and social results of a 4 years' use of automatic and supervisory control on the power supply system of the Cincinnati Street Railway. It is written from the viewpoint of an executive or an operating engineer, accurately reflects operating experience, and is designed to be of assistance to those who may be contemplating similar developments. It touches upon several extensive topics of which space prohibits development, but the recognition should be thought-provoking."
"Discovery within recent years of large oil-producing areas has greatly stimulated the development of the pipe line industry, making it an important customer of the electric utility and manufacturing companies. The application of electric motors and control equipment to pipe line pumping stations is described in this article. The fundamentals of pipe line pumping are emphasized for the benefit of electrical engineers not familiar with this industry."
"CONSIDERABLE reduction in cost has been secured through the use of arc welded steel roofs for 4 huge grain elevators built by the Port of New York Authority at Albany, N. Y. It is possible for similar construction methods to be used in other types of structures."
"Operating experience with many electric power lines of various types utilizing wood as lightning insulation, has demonstrated that ordinary wood can be used to advantage in combination with other measures for improving the lightning performance of lines. In this article are outlined the results of a careful analysis of this operating data and the pertinent conclusions drawn therefrom. Methods of construction offering the greatest promise at present are: diverting the lightning strokes so as to prevent flashovers to the power conductors; draining the lightning from the power conductors through fast operating dynamic follow current interrupting devices; and a combination of these 2 methods."
"INTERPRETIVE abstracts of all papers which at the time of this issue are definitely scheduled for presentation at the technical sessions of the winter convention of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (January 23–27, 1933) are published herewith, excepting only those papers published in this issue of ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING. Abstracts of the remainder of winter convention papers are scheduled for publication in the February issue. In addition to the papers, 4 addresses are scheduled for presentation at the technical sessions."
"APPLICATION of a resistor connected in series with a condenser as a means for indicating the rate of change of a d-c potential is described in this paper. When the potential is varied the condenser will charge or discharge through the resistor, and the charging current will produce a voltage drop across the resistor. This voltage drop is approximately proportional to the rate of change of the applied potential."
"SUPERVISORY control schemes of various types have been used for a number of years in controlling the operation of circuit breakers and similar equipment at a distant unattended substation. Supervisory control permits the selection of a large number of operations with only a few line wires."
"Blasts of vapor have been discovered in the last few years to issue at high velocity from the cathode region of a vacuum arc. The consideration of this subject is important in the study of the arc. Previous theories of the cathode of an arc which have not taken account of the vapor stream must be extended, for the vapor blast, as it now appears, is a part of the cathode phenomena and as such must be included in any satisfactory theory of the cathode of an arc. The energy carried away in the high velocity vapor stream, which is not an inconsiderable part of the total energy loss at the cathode, must be included in the heat balance at the cathode. This paper reviews the experimental evidence for the existence of the vapor blast, and discusses the theories proposed to explain its origin."
"COMMUNICATION services required for operation of the Pennsylvania Railroad and for the convenience of its patrons are described in this paper, including a description of the company-owned outside plant required to provide these services, as well as tabulations showing the magnitude of some classes of business handled and plant involved. The Pennsylvania Railroad owns, maintains, and operates its pole lines, conduit lines, and cable system, and where wires or cables of commercial telegraph or telephone companies are on the railroad right-of-way, they are on a rental basis"
"EFFICIENCY of train operation depends largely upon a system of directing train movements that will insure the maximum utilization of track and equipment capacity and the maximum output of train miles in a unit of time. In the earlier days the time interval method of railway signaling was favored, movements being directed by timetables and train orders. The space interval method is now universally recognized as most satisfactory, train movements being directed by block signals in addition to timetables and train orders. Block signals may be operated manually or automatically by means of a track circuit, the shunting of which by the trains operating upon the rails actuates the apparatus."
"MOST modern signal systems have many features of interlocking and signal control that are common to each other. A description of the signal system on one railroad, therefore, may be of interest to others. Following a brief outline of the earliest forms of signaling employed on the Reading Railroad, this paper describes the Reading's most recent installation of 100-cycle a-c color light signaling. The 100-cycle frequency was first used in the continuous coded train control territory, where a distinctive frequency was required to eliminate any possibility of foreign inductive interference, and was later adopted for use in electrified territory, as the range between the 100-cycle signal frequency and the 25-cycle electrification frequency permitted the use of frequency selective track relays."
"CENTRALIZED traffic control systems concentrate at one point under the direction of one operator the control of train movements over a long section of track, and expedite the movement of traffic in that section. This is accomplished by bringing within view of the operator, indications as to the location of trains and the position of all switches and controlled signals, and also by bringing within his reach means whereby he is enabled to change, when safe to do so, the position of switches and signals affecting the movement of trains."
"SELF-EXCITING a-c commutator generators have for some time been considered as sources of electrical power. However, what is probably the first commercial use of this type of generator as the prime source of energy for a power machine has recently been made. It is a 6-pole 1,200-rpm 3-phase machine rated 40 kva, 235 volts, 2.5 cycles, and is driven by a squirrel cage induction motor. The set supplies power to one or more 200 hp super-calender induction motors in order to secure threading operation at very low stable speeds. The generator is compounded for approximately flat voltage and frequency. Commutation has been found to be excellent and the voltage wave form is satisfactory."
"TREATMENT is given in this paper to the temperature rise in the armatures of electrical machines after the machines have been run for such lengths of time that the temperatures have ceased to rise. However, it is stated that the method given for calculating these temperatures for the steady state condition can be extended so as to apply to the transient state as well."
"SATISFACTORY parallel operation of a-c generators is dependent primarily upon the proper load-speed characteristics of the generators. When driven by reciprocating type prime movers it has been thoroughly investigated and recognized that none of the major torque harmonics of the prime mover should coincide with any of the natural periods of oscillation of the several generators operating in parallel. This paper describes an investigation of the further question of stability of parallel operation when load is suddenly thrown off or on the system, troubles of this sort having been experiences in actual operation."
"INVESTIGATIONS of synchronous motor phenomena during transient conditions have been made, using a mechanical calculating machine called the “differential analyzer” to solve the non-linear differential equations involved. Previous investigations have been made on a preliminary calculating machine called the “product integraph.” The extent and accuracy of the solutions, however, were limited on this preliminary machine, and the work was confined principally to determining whether or not a synchronous motor would synchronize for the worst switching conditions. The curves presented in the present paper and obtained by use of the differential analyzer make it possible to calculate quantitatively the additional load that may be synchronized if the field switch is closed at the most favorable switching angle."
"RESULTS of certain mathematical investigations which have been found to be of practical use in the analysis of problems involving the transient behavior of interconnected machines are presented in this paper."
"APPLICATION of air conditioning to passenger cars has required development of considerable equipment, including axle generators of larger capacity, a suitable generator drive, a light weight compressor for operation with Freon, and a system which would stand the severe service met in railway operation. The exacting requirements of weight and space added greatly to the difficulty."
"THE GENERAL system problem encountered in the supply of power for electric traction is dealt with through a study of the electrical characteristics of the principal available systems, namely:"
"OPERATION of the 3,000-volt d-c passenger locomotives on the Cleveland Union Terminals electrification has been studied after an initial period of service of more than 2 years. Twenty-two locomotives weighing 210 tons each are in service, normally handling passenger trains weighing 1,275 tons trailing over grades as high as 1.56 per cent."
"CALCULATION of the characteristics of a-c equipments as applied to locomotives and cars presents difficulties not found when dealing with d-c equipments due to the additional variables involved. Characteristics of the motors are usually presented on the basis of constant voltages at the motor terminals. However, the motors operate in service from an assumed constant voltage power source with a certain amount of impedance such as transformer, preventive coil, and bus bar or cable resistance and reactance in series with the motors. Not only does the vector relation of the impedance drop to the motor voltage vary with motor power factor, but the impedance itself varies depending upon the combination of contactors and transformer taps being used."
"A GREAT number of locomotives have up to this time been equipped with control systems utilizing either electro-pneumatically or electromagnetically operated unit switches and preventive coils in various combinations. However, a great many single phase locomotives built abroad have been equipped with a simple and quite efficient control system, whereby a tapping switch and bridging resistances are used. With such a tapping switch the number of current breaking switch units is greatly reduced. The weight of the entire control system, which does not utilize any preventive coils, is also less than that of unit switch-preventive coil systems."
"A SINGLE unit mercury arc rectifier of 3,000-kw rating at 600 volts is discussed as regards design and operation. A typical installation, that of the new Eighth Avenue subway of the New York board of transportation, is described where units of this size have been advantageously applied to the subsurface substations."
"THE OBJECT of the development described in this paper has been to so modify and equip the synchronous commutator of the short-circuiting type as to enable it to perform the 2 functions of rectification and inversion interchangeably under conditions of comparatively high voltage and current."
"PROTECTION of rotating a-c machines against traveling wave voltages divides itself into 2 problems: protection of insulation to ground against impulse overvoltages and protection of the turn insulation against steep wave fronts. The impulse insulation strength of the machine to ground is assumed equal to approximately 2 times the terminal-to-terminal crest voltage (2.12E). The turn insulation strength is given in curve form and varies with machine kva and speed."
"RESULTS of a lightning investigation conducted in cooperation with a number of power companies are presented in this paper which is the fourth of a series of A.I.E.E. papers by the same authors. The principal work in the past 2 years, summarized in this paper, has been a study of the magnitude and polarity of tower current caused by lightning strokes. The data indicate that when the product of the tower current times the tower footing resistance is high, flashover of the line insulator may be expected, and conversely when the product is low flashover usually does not occur."
"CONTINUING a 4-year operating record of an extensive 132-kv transmission system under lightning conditions, this paper presents and discusses the record for 1930 and 1931. Operating experience is given on yearly line outages due to lightning, severity, and frequency of lightning storms over the system, frequency of double circuit outages, extent of line and station apparatus damage, effect of tower footing resistance in reducing lightning outages, reduction in tower footing resistances by the use of driven ground rods and counterpoises, effect on lightning outages by overinsulation, relative magnitudes of single-phase, 2-phase, and 3-phase line faults, and location of lightning flashovers on the line in reference to top, middle, and bottom conductors."
"IN THIS paper is presented the results of laboratory tests with a 1,000,000-volt surge generator and 60-cycle high voltage testing equipment on 26-kv transmission poles now in use on a large system. Actual impulse curves are given for several types of straight span pole top construction. Values of impulse flashovers for the basic component parts of a pole are presented to furnish means for comparing types of construction not tested and to aid in applying protective gaps for the prevention of wood shattering. Wooden crossarm braces greatly increase the insulation on double-circuit vertical configuration construction but are of little use on singlecircuit horizontal configuration pole tops. The data given enable the more complete utilization of the wood on pole tops for insulation."
"CONTROL of hydrogen ion concentration in metal flotation, electrolytic reduction, and electrolytic refining processes has usually been accomplished by the expensive, slow, and inaccurate methods of colorimetric analysis and manual control. The desirability of automatic regulation of the concentration of these chemicals has been apparent for a long time but no method of regulation has been suggested that meets all the requirements."
"NEED of a suitable standard of low power factor for use in checking the accuracy of the various devices and bridges employed in the measurement of loss in dielectric samples is pointed out in this paper. The relative merits of the different methods that have been proposed for this purpose are discussed and then the low power factor standard which has been developed is described. This standard consists of a shielded and guarded air capacitor having in series with its guard and main circuits an ideally shielded resistor. The ideally shielded resistor is made up of 2 concentric resistances with the same value of resistance per unit length. The inner resistance is connected in series with the main electrode of the air capacitor, and the outer resistance, which shields the inner, is connected in series with the air capacitor guard. The use of this ideally shielded resistor in connection with the air capacitor makes it possible to have a zero potential difference at all points between the guard and the main electrode."
"A BRIDGE constructed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the measurement of the power factor of small oil samples to an absolute power-factor precision of 10 ∼6 is described in this paper. The bridge is being used in a research project for the study of commercial cable oils and pure synthetic hydrocarbons."
"IN THE DESIGN of bus bars for generating stations and substations, particularly of the isolated-phase type, there is need for more complete information on the skin effect, at commercial frequencies, in large conductors of rectangular cross-section. The present paper describes a method of measurement and presents data that were obtained for conductors of various ratios of width to thickness."
"VARIABLE voltage d-c drive is stated to be the most recent advance in electric oil well drilling equipment and has been used successfully by both the cable tool and the rotary method of drilling. A discussion of the methods of drilling is given in this paper in order to show the characteristics required of the electrical equipment."
"THE GENERAL characteristic of electronic control devices is outlined in this paper, and the features which make the application of these devices desirable from an industrial point of view are referred to. Also, various recent developments in electronic devices for industrial control are described in detail."
"LARGE size and complexity of the modern power system are directing the attention of relay engineers to the problem of securing overall protection for the major transmission lines. The advantages of this type of protection, inherently instantaneous for faults within its boundaries and inherently selective in the case of faults on other parts of the system are readily apparent."
"USELESS operations of protectors on low voltage distribution networks are practically eliminated when controlled by a relay that has been designed in accordance with the principles laid down in the companion paper “Application of Phase Sequence Principles to Relaying of Low Voltage Secondary Networks.” This relay consists of a single phase induction disk directional element, 2 overcurrent control elements of the contactor type, and suitable current and voltage filters to make it operative on 3-phase circuits. All parts, with the exception of 2 resistors and a phasing lamp, are mounted in a standard relay case."
"AN IMPROVED network relaying system utilizing a conventional single-phase relaying element and plunger type overcurrent elements excited by symmetrical phase sequence components to represent completely power flow conditions and control protector operation on a 3-phase 4-wire secondary network system is described in this paper. The general features of relay design and operating experience are outlined in the companion paper “A Sequence Relay for Network Protectors.”"
"AN EQUATION of the form μ = PBa has been derived experimentally, where μ represents permeability and B represents flux density. This equation closely reproduces the flux density-permeability curve for magnetic materials of various compositions and qualities in the flux range of approximately 80 to 6,500 gausses. The data, obtained in the usual way from averaging samples, is graphed on log-log paper using μ/B2 versus B, the latter being the independent variable. The coefficient P and exponent a are determined by graphical and analytical means, both being influenced by the nature of the material, the former being indicative of the relative value of the initial permeability. Several curves and data sheets show the salient features of the method and accuracy in reproduction. A list of various grades of silicon steel and alloys is included to illustrate the values P and a may have, and the range over which the equation holds."
"IN ANALYZING the transient or steady state performance of any rotating machine a system of linear equations is set up for finding the currents, another system is set up for the torque, etc. The setting up of the equations is usually laborious and due to the accidental steps made in their solutions the final results are in a form that is difficult to interpret physically. A method is shown by which the procedure of setting up the systems of equations and finding and interpreting the results are standardized in a few simple forms that can be quickly and easily handled by routine substitutions of constants."
"IN THE experiments described in this and in earlier papers, a method has been found whereby it is possible to predict accurately the dielectric loss and other properties of impregnated paper, in terms of simple electrical properties, as measured under continuous potential, of the oil and of the paper separately. Moreover, the methods developed permit the separation of the dielectric loss into 2 components, one due to conduction, and another due to reversible dielectric absorption, thereby throwing much new light upon the nature of the dielectric loss, and upon the relation of its 2 components to the basic properties of the oil and the paper."
"RECTIFIERS and inverters employing grid-controlled gas or vapor filled electronic valves require some means of interrupting the current through the tube. Commutation is the term applied to the interrupting of this current. In this paper the problem of commutation is discussed and a method of using a harmonic circuit of reduced kva to force commutation is described."
"AFTER presenting various theories of the cathode of an electric arc and describing numerous methods for initiating an arc cathode, a new method of starting the arc cathode is described. It is of the separating contact type, but to a considerable degree is free from the inertia difficulty of ordinary separating contacts. One form of this starter consists of a small section pointed tungsten rod placed in a mercury arc tube so that it dipped slightly to a depth of about one mm below the mercury surface. On sending sufficient current through the rod, the cathode of an arc was promptly started at the rod and mercury junction, and this starting could be regularly repeated 60 times per sec."
"VARIATIONS in electrical properties of composite insulation with changes in temperature and frequency are important because they lead to concepts of physical causes of such variations, and therefore indicate how to obtain improved electrical properties in commercial materials. Typical experimental data are presented showing the capacitance and loss characteristics of synthetic resin laminated materials and of imperfect composite dielectrics made from combinations of fused quartz or glass and semi-conducting liquids. An example is given showing agreement between calculated and observed characteristics of such a glass-liquid combination."
"ARRANGEMENTS have been practically completed for the A.I.E.E. winter convention which will be held with headquarters in the Engineering Societies Building, 33 West 39th Street, New York, N. Y., January 23–27, 1933. Contrary to the general trend of the times toward reductions, the program offers all the splendid features of past winter convention programs, but at a reduced cost to those in attendance. The schedule of events consists of 14 technical sessions which present a broad field of timely subject matter. Interesting and profitable inspection trips will provide recreation. A buffet dinner and a dinner dance afford ample opportunity for social discourse and in addition there will be special entertainment for the visiting women."
"CONTRIBUTIONS to these columns are invited from Institute members and subscribers. They should be concise and may deal with technical papers, articles published in previous issues, or other subjects of some general interest and professional importance. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING will endeavor to publish as many letters as possible, but of necessity reserves the right to publish them in whole or in part, or to reject them entirely. STATEMENTS in these letters are expressly understood to be made by the writers; publication here in no wise constitutes endorsement or recognition by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers."
"Advertisement of available employment opportunities."

"Herewith is presented a review of Man's accomplishments in the transmutation of the elements of our physical world, from the time of ancient mythology when the alchemists sought to transform lesser substances into gold and silver, down to the time of our present-day alchemists, the modern physicists. The goal of today's battle is not precious metals, but energy."
"In this article is described a new development in supervisory control wherein the apparatus to be operated at a remote point is selected directly, without any intermediate connections to apparatus which is not to be operated. As many as 50 breakers may be controlled over 4 lines, while 25 can be operated over 2 lines."
"Many interesting design problems were encountered in the development of a suitable air conditioning equipment for railway passenger cars. In this article is presented a discussion of these problems together with a description of their solution, thus providing an account of a most interesting development as well as an outline of the requirements for this service."
"Results of a series of impulse and dynamic flashover tests on unit pole transmission construction now in standard use on a large 26-kv electric power transmission system are presented herewith. From the data obtained the net flashover voltages of wood and porcelain combinations of simple pole tops can be estimated. With the aid of data now available it is possible to design a wood pole line having almost any practical degree of lightning reliability."
"ELECTRIFICATION of auxiliaries on 4 new sister ships of the Grace Line is stated to be “one of the most complete ever attempted in marine service. These ships are designed for the Panama mail fleet, the first ship, the S.S. “Santa Rosa,” having sailed on her maiden voyage November 26, 1932. These ships are of the twin screw, combination passenger-cargo type."
"In 2 years of operation covering more than 1,000,000 miles the 22 3,000 — volt d-c passenger locomotives in use on the Cleveland Union Terminals electrification have experienced only 6 electrical failures. In this article the design and characteristics of the locomotives are reviewed briefly, and operating and maintenance data for the 2-yr period are summarized."
"INSULATING oil, capillary action of oil as related to paper, and properties of impregnated paper were discussed in considerable detail at the sessions of the committee on electrical insulation of the division of engineering and industrial research of the National Research Council, held in conjunction with the Institute's Middle Eastern District meeting, Baltimore, Md., October 10–13, 1932. A joint session under the auspices of the A.I.E.E. and the National Research Council was held, abstracts of these papers having been presented in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING for September 1932, p. 659–60."
"LOOKING BACK at the recent annual meeting of the committee held in Baltimore, it is possible to segregate the material presented in the various progress reports of research into a few groups which indicate the directions in which recent research effort has been directed. As has been usual in past years, the points of departure in nearly all cases have been the problems of practice. Even in those instances in which the work has been done by physicists and chemists, and so is of more fundamental character, there is distinct evidence of effort to link the work with some of the more common manifestations of dielectric behavior as found in practice."
"CONTINUAL warfare is being carried on in numerous research laboratories against that arch enemy of high voltage cables, ionization. The cable in process contains air, so that the conditions on which this enemy would thrive are present and must be driven out in the beginning. From then on, there is no let-up in the fight to keep it out."
"AUTHORS' abstracts of papers presented at the sessions of the committee on electrical insulation of the National Research Council held in Baltimore, Md., October 11 and 12, 1932, follow. Requests for additional information should be addressed to National Research Council, 29 West 39th Street, New York, N. Y."
"Following the intensive development of electronic tubes in recent years has come an increasing application of these tubes to industrial control operations. Several successful installations in different industries testify to the superiority of this type of control over the more conventional electromechanical type. In this article the relative advantages of electronic control are outlined, and 3 typical applications are described in detail."
"An energy consumption of 238,000,000 kwhr per year will be required to handle through passenger trains on the electrified portion of the Pennsylvania Railroad system between New York City and Philadelphia, Pa., on which through service recently was initiated. This article describes the system used to supply that energy to the moving trains. The arrangement of apparatus and circuits adopted has resulted in low first cost, low operating maintenance, and reliability and simplicity of operation."
"The balancing of a composite submarine telegraph cable, that is, one composed of both loaded and unloaded sections, requires a knowledge of its terminal impedance characteristics. In this article the impedance of such a cable is shown to be similar to that of an “equivalent” unloaded cable. Because of its limited frequency range, however, the type of network used with the unloaded cable at low speed signalling cannot furnish a satisfactory balance at the higher speeds of which the composite cable is capable; it is predicted that the mathematical theory developed here will aid in devising a means of extending that range."
"The field of application of the multi-anode metal tank mercury cathode rectifier now available is outlined in this article with special attention to its adaptability to industrial load. Comparison of rectifiers with synchronous converters and motor generator sets is made, and loss and efficiency data are presented."
"INTERPRETIVE abstracts of all papers presented at the technical sessions of the A.I.E.E. winter convention were published in the January 1933 issue of ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, excepting only: (1) those papers upon which articles in that or preceding issues were based; and (2) those papers which at the time of going to press for that issue were not definitely scheduled for presentation. Abstracts of all remaining technical papers are presented herewith."
"THE TRANSIENT behavior of an arc welding generator, it is generally agreed, has considerable influence on the nature of the weld produced, both as to quality of weld and ease of manipulation. Several designs of generators have recently appeared which have been built to meet these requirements. This paper deals with the theory of armature and field current transients in such generators, giving the mathematical analysis and experimental results. From the tests were obtained oscillograms showing the effect of variation in the armature and field circuit inductance, and the mutual inductance between them."
"IN AN ATTEMPT to verify the theory previously given of electric welders with controlled transients, tests have been made on a neutralized welder and a standard type welder with and without a reactor transformer. Oscillograms show that while the standard machine has a large rise of current when short-circuited for 2 or 3 cycles of a 60 cycle wave, the machines with controlled transients have a very much reduced rise of current, and to this their improved performance partly is ascribed. A second important factor is the recovery of voltage after short circuit. It is shown that the function of the reactor transformer is to neutralize the mutual induction between the series and shunt fields of the welder, thereby rendering the field current more nearly independent of occurrences in the welding circuit."
"THE equation V = A + B/In which represents correctly all normal arc characteristics is used as the starting point for a general discussion of arc phenomena and industrial applications. Tests of this equation are applied to iron arcs in various gas atmospheres to obtain a series of values for A and B making possible certain deductions about arc voltage variations and significance of the characteristics. In limiting the current exponent n, the anode temperature must exert considerable influence upon the discharge as a whole. Suggestions are given why this may be so. A value of n is predicted from the arc stream geometry, and is compared with actual values of n for various arcs."
"IN THE early days of the electrical industry, surges were relatively mysterious as to their origin, magnitude, and behavior. The ordinary factory tests now required by the A.I.E.E. rules were the reflection of experience and judgment rather than the analysis which has been made possible in the last few years. From experience, it was found on the one hand that it was necessary to increase the insulation of some parts of the transformers far above the requirements of the A.I.E.E. rules (i. e., turn and coil insulation bushings) and, on the other hand, to limit the voltages transmitted to the transformer from the line, by the specification of line insulation and protective gaps. In the meanwhile, progress has been made in the laboratory study of the surge characteristics of the insulators, gaps, and insulation structures commonly used in transformers."
"WITH the application of surge tests to high voltage electrical apparatus, the question of the measurement of high surge voltages has become a subject of prime importance. In Part I of this paper is shown the practical work done in a commercial laboratory to calibrate the measuring devices, and in Part II are studied the more interesting relationships that affect the operation and accuracy of these measuring devices."
"EQUIPMENT and methods used for the surge testing of distribution transformers at the engineering experiment station at Purdue University are described in this paper. The surge generator of 1,000 kv maximum and the cathode ray oscillograph used in these tests are described. Curves are presented to show the desirability of ultra-violet illumination of the sphere gaps, especially for the smaller gaps and shorter spacings."
"COORDINATION of system insulation is the selection of insulation in proportion to the anticipated overvoltages as limited by a coordination gap. A review of the development of coordination during the past few years is presented briefly in this paper, as a basis for discussing the means at present used for obtaining coordination of system insulation together with the advantages and disadvantages of various schemes. The 2 classes of overvoltage which may appear on a system, namely, switching surges and arcing ground voltages in the first class, and lightning voltages in the second class, are considered in respect to the selection of the coordination gap. It is pointed out that it is not logical to have steps or levels of insulation within a station, but that a uniform level of at least 10 per cent above the strength of the gap seems logical."
"IMPULSE testing of insulation and the precautions necessary to produce impulse voltages of the desired wave shape are treated in this paper. Such testing involves the construction of circuits of the proper electrical constants, the accurate measurement of these constants, the calculation of electrical variations in the circuit, and the checking of these calculations by indicating and recording instruments."
"CONTINUITY of service, reduction in maintenance cost, and increase in safety to operators and property have made it necessary to improve the protective devices used in the distribution circuit. In the past, this protection has been provided by knife switches and fuses. The construction of circuit breakers occupying small space has recently been made possible through increase in design knowledge, and development of new materials, together with an increase in knowledge of arc phenomena and of arc interrupters."
"IN REFERENCE to the cgs magnetic units, a brief historical outline is presented of the action taken by international electrical congresses from 1893 to 1904, and by international technical and scientific unions from 1904 to 1932. Emphasis is laid upon the results of the meeting of July 1932 of the symbols, units, and nomenclature committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics, as the latest development."
"AN ELECTRONIC recorder has been developed which will record d-c millivolts and microamperes at energy levels of 4 or 5 microwatts, and, with auxiliary equipment, will record feeble alternating currents and voltages. A pilot element attached to the measuring element of any usual type indicating instrument mechanism is connected in series with a second pilot element at the pen mechanism. A motor element for driving the recording element and carrying the second pilot element coil is driven by an amplifier which receives its indication from the difference in angular position of the 2 pilot elements. The stationary fields of both pilot elements are connected in parallel to the same a-c source."
"CAREFUL planning on the part of the Institute's many committees was largely responsible for the success of the recent winter convention held in New York, N. Y., January 23–27, 1933. Through their efforts and cooperation, all events proceeded smoothly and enabled those in attendance to secure the maximum benefits from the technical sessions and inspection trips, and the greatest pleasure from the various entertainment features provided."
"At the conclusion of the Edison Medal presentation, an address on “Evolution of Society As Influenced by the Engineer,” was presented by Dr. J. C. Merriam, president of Carnegie Institution of Washington, D. C. In his address, Doctor Merriam eulogized the engineer for his development of facilities such as communication and transportation, which have tied the world together and made possible that close touch with affairs and personalities necessary to the success of democratic government. As of tremendous importance to the development of society, he also mentioned the increased leisure and time for thought which had been made possible by the development of machines."
"AT the session on education, held January 25, 1933, during the Institute's winter convention, New York, N. Y., an address entitled “The professional development of the engineer” was delivered by Gen. R. I. Rees, vice-president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, New York. In his address, General Rees first discussed the education of the engineer up to the time of his graduation from college. Of the relative values of general and specialized education, he made among other remarks the following statements:"

"Westinghouse Active in Air-Conditioning Field. — Recent announcements tell of the formation of a new Air-Conditioning Department of the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company which will coordinate its various existing activities and project its future activities in this field. The company's interest in air-conditioning extends back over a considerable period and includes physiological work on comfort conditions, such as that on effects of radiant heat in its research laboratories as well as actual experimental installations of equipment. At the present time commercial equipment either now is, or soon will be available for railway car cooling; room cooling for homes, offices, and shops; low temperature radiation heaters, and steam operated refrigeration equipment for commercial and industrial applications. Among the interesting developments being carried on which have not yet reached a commercial state is that of the reversed refrigeration cycle for winter heating, and which also can be used for summer cooling as well. The plans of the Air-Conditioning Department are intended to make Westinghouse an important factor in the air-conditioning field aside from large centralized plant installations."

"Some phases of present day economic conditions of particular interest to engineers are outlined in this article. An attempt is made to show that conditions are not greatly different from what they always have been, and that there is no need either for any radical change in the established theory of individual initiative or for “any adaptation of more and more socialism under one of the many new-fangled names connected therewith.”"
"The applications of electricity to chemical processes are increasing at a startling rate. In this article the development of electrochemical processes including the production of many metals and other products is reviewed, and the amounts of electric energy consumed by the various processes over the past 10 or 15 years are given. Predictions are made for a greatly expanding use of electricity in the next decade."
"In spite of a doubling of trains and train miles, and schedules faster by 20 per cent, the cost of suburban operation has been lowered substantially by electrification. Resulting service improvements have changed an appreciable traffic loss to a traffic increase. Important details of the system and its equipment are described here."
"Overall protection of transmission lines may be secured by the use of a communication system to (1) compare the relative direction of fault current flow at line ends, or (2) link the tripping circuit at the line ends. The various types of communication systems adaptable for relay purposes are considerd in this article."
"There has been developed an electronic recorder applicable for such feeble quantities as thermal emfs, vacuum tube currents and voltages, light intensities, and magnetic strain gage readings. A description of this recorder, its characteristics, and fields of application are described in this article."
"NAMES of some of the more common types of hot cathode tubes used for control and power purposes are given in Table I. This table also includes the trade names employed by a few of the manufacturers but should not be interpreted as a complete tabulation for all manufacturers. No attempt has been made to include the many varieties of radio tubes."
"The influences of the engineer on society in general are outlined in the following address, which Doctor Merriam presented before a recent meeting of the A.I.E.E. In addition to pointing out the debt of society to the engineer, Doctor Merriam indicates methods whereby the engineer might be of still greater use in the development of a well-informed and intelligent society."
"“Cold” light, the theoretically ideal conversion of electrical energy into light, is still some distance from attainment, being rendered unattainable largely because of a lack of complete theories of the production of light. A summary of the present knowledge in this field and an indication of future possibilities and lines of attack are presented in this article."
"Herewith is presented a chart by means of which the in-place cost of units of plant of pole-using utilities can be estimated; the principle upon which the chart is based may be applied also to many other classes of plant and equipment. A typical example illustrating the use of the chart is given."
"Results of previous corona loss measurements are corroborated and new information revealed in recent tests made at the Ryan laboratory, Stanford University, Calif. The experiments included tests on conductors as large as 2 in. in diameter, at line potentials as high as 600 kv, and an investigation of the effects of several different surface treatments."
"Limitations of laterally cut sound records have led to renewed researches in the recording and reproducing of sound with particular attention to the inherently better, but more difficultly achieved vertically cut record. The aggregate result of these researches represents a distinct forward step in the art."
"Many natural resources either are irreplaceable or may be replaced at an extremely slow rate. Science supplements these resources not only by making possible a more efficient utilization of them, but also by providing acceptable substitutes. This is the sixteenth article in the Engineering Foundation's symposium “Has Man Benefited by Engineering Progress?”"
"IN 2 papers, “Amplifiers for Precise Oscillographic Measurements” (Journal of the Franklin Institute, v. 213, June 1932, p. 605–22) and 4 The Amplifier-Oscillograph Applied to the Study of Dielectrics With Continuous Potentials” (Physics, v. 3, July 1932, p. 1–10) Sigmund K. Waldorf, research associate, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md., describes the design and construction of the amplifier oscillograph and outlines results obtained in one of its applications. The many interesting applications of this device have included studies of: high voltage wave forms, parasitical corona on high voltage systems, wave forms of magnetic flux in the air gap of an a-c galvanometer, and a-c ionization and d-c charge and discharge currents in insulating materials. In the belief that the device and its uses may be of some possible interest to readers of Electrical Engineering, brief abstracts of the 2 papers are presented herewith."
"The most commonly accepted general method of controlling 3-electrode gas-filled tubes is by shifting the phase of the grid voltage relative to that of the anode voltage. An alternative general method which may be termed the condenser-discharge method has proved highly satisfactory in a variety of applications. Several examples of this type of control are described in this article."
"This article discusses 4 years' experience in the operation of unattended automatic mercury arc rectifier and rotary converter substations supplying 600-volt d-c energy to overhead trolleys in interurban territory. The seriousness of minor failures in control equipment ordinarily employed in automatic stations is emphasized, and the replacement of some integral parts of automatic station control systems with more reliable equipment is recommended."
"MEETINGS were held by many of the Institute's general and technical committees during the winter convention held in New York, N. Y., Jan. 23–27, 1933.

"Efforts to develop standards for noise measurements were actively initiated during the Institute's North Eastern District meeting held in Rochester, N. Y., April 29–May 2, 1931. As one of the steps in the program to develop standards, a session on sound measurement was held at the recent winter convention, New York, N. Y., January 23–27, 1933. At this session an address was delivered by Dr. Harvey Fletcher (M'23, F'30) of the Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc. Following this address a meeting of the A.I.E.E. committee on sound was held, as reported elsewhere in this issue. Suggestions from members in connection with the subject of sound measurement will be welcomed by the committee."
"The meeting of the Institute's North Eastern District, No. 1, will be held in Schenectady, N. Y., May 10–12, 1933. Four technical sessions are scheduled for this meeting in addition to a student session. The technical sessions have been selected to include items of particular interest. There will be a session on air conditioning in industry and the home, a session on aviation, one on reactive power, and a fourth on selected subjects.

"“Cosmic rays” is the name applied to the ultimate cause of that part of the ionization of the air that cannot be ascribed to any known agencies. In spite of this prosaic definition, however, seldom if ever has there been a subject of research in physics in which intrinsic importance and romantic associations so happily are combined. In view of the fundamental importance of cosmic ray research, in this article is given a review of studies made in this engrossing field from the time of early experiments with the gold leaf electroscope down to the present day of many and conflicting theories and speculations."
"Distribution transformers in several locations on a New England system have been operating for several months with the primary lightning arrester ground interconnected with the transformer secondary neutral. Experience over the past few months definitely indicates the advantages of this connection in reducing troubles due to lightning, without increasing the hazard to the customers' wiring. Increased clearances on transformer primary bushings also reduce the number of failures."
"IN SWITZERLAND, the country of the “white coal” as electricity is called there, another important electrification has been accomplished by the construction of a large seasonal storage plant, the Oberhasli hydroelectric development above Meiringen in the Bernese Oberland. Construction work on the first step of this project was completed recently and the Handeck generating station was placed in regular operation on October 1, 1932."
"AN ADDRESS “The Era of Public Enterprise” was delivered by Walter Rautenstrauch, professor of industrial engineering, Columbia University, New York, N. Y., at a meeting of the Advertising Club of New York, held March 1, 1933, in that city. Following Professor Rautenstrauch's address, which extolled the benefits expected from increased public enterprise, an address was given by Dr. Virgil Jordan, president, National Industrial Conference Board, Inc., New York, N. Y., in which the case for private enterprise was argued. Excerpts from these 2 addresses follow. These conflicting views are published without editorial comment, in the hope that, between them, the readers of ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING may find constructive suggestions and be stimulated to further ideas. Comments, criticisms, and suggestions are invited, as “letters to the editor” they will be considered for possible publication."
"THE MANY suggestions for the solution of our economic difficulties put forward during the past 3 years of the depression are so varied in their proposals and in the principles underlying them that it seems almost hopeless for us to arrive at any concerted action to get us out of our difficulties. This seems to be due to 2 causes: First, an entire lack of common understanding of basic economic principles; and second, a lack of vision on the part of many people to see beyond the horizon of their limited and confining experiences."
"THE REAL difficulty with the pattern of public enterprise, the idea of having a government of any sort, whether of engineers, economists, or Tammany politicians, run our industries and businesses in an orderly fashion lies in this simple fact: We, as a people, and as individuals, are not made in the way we would have to be to fit into the pattern. Perhaps we can be made to fit some day, but that is a question of eugenics, not of economics or engineering."
"Traveling waves may appear in power cables connected to high voltage transmission lines. The differences in voltage that will appear between the conductor and sheath of a cable at various points depend upon the nature and location of the cable sheath grounds. A few of the results of a considerable number of tests made to determine their effect are presented in this article, and some conclusions regarding protective measures are drawn."
"Conductors on electric power transmission lines have been observed to vibrate with amplitudes as great as 20 ft during sleet storms with the temperature just below freezing, and with a heavy wind blowing transversly across the line. An explanation of this phenomenon is given."
"Some important requirements for modern steel tower transmission lines are presented in the following outline prepared by Group II of the A.I.E.E. subcommittee on steel transmission towers and conductors. This material is intended as a general guide to designers and is not a specification. Clearances, mechanical reliability, strength against lightning, and prevention of vibration, are considered."
"In this article are described applications of simple series and parallel non-linear electrical circuits to a-c voltage and current relays; such relays are characterized by great sensitivity. The special properties of the resonant-current relay make it especially adaptable for use as an undercurrent or undervoltage relay."
"IN THE LIGHT of the present trends that are influencing the design, application, and operation of circuit breakers in electric power systems it seems reasonable to expect that the satisfactory circuit breaker of the future must have the ability to interrupt, in a few cycles and with minimum arcing, a circuit carrying a large load, and do this effectively without the use of oil. In the course of electrical engineering work at the University of Colorado, the authors developed 2 circuit breaker designs which show possibilities of incorporating the several desirable features requisite in a satisfactory circuit breaker. One design is an air-stream circuit breaker operating with compressed air, the other a vapor-blast circuit breaker operating with the use of ordinary water."
"A high speed relay for the protection of transmission lines has been developed which uses the induction dynamometer principle for the production of torque. This relay operates on the reactance principle. Details of the relay and its operating characteristics are presented herewith."
"Among the many interesting and valuable applications of that versatile device, the 3-electrode hot-cathode gas-filled thermionic tube, is the inverter. Of the several different types of circuits developed, the “parallel” type gives promise of becoming of some importance, and already has been used commercially for supplying power to a-c radio sets from d-c systems. This article gives an analysis of the operation of this type of inverter under different load conditions."
"Periodically mankind has bewailed the end of substantial progress, repeatedly to find that the apparent end was in fact a beginning. Quotations from the published works of previous eras are given in substantiation of the maintenance of a constructive, forward-looking attitude in spite of present awesome difficulties."
"ONE FEATURE of the Institute's North Eastern District meeting to be held in Schenectady, N. Y., May 10–12, 1933, is a symposium on reactive power, held under the chairmanship of A. E. Knowlton. An introduction to this symposium prepared by Mr. Knowlton is presented herewith, following which are the 2 papers of the symposium available and approved in time for publication in this issue. One of these, by J. Allen Johnson, is written from the practical point of view, and the other, by V. G. Smith, is written from the theoretical point of view. Although these 2 papers do not cover all of the many factors involved in the discussion on reactive power, they are representative of different schools of thought."
"To assist in clarifying the present concepts of reactive power, the following introduction to the subject has been prepared. An analysis of the reactive conventions made by Doctor Silsbee, a member of the subcommittee, is included."
"“Reactive power” is discussed in this article from the point of view of the practical operating engineer. The direction of flow in a transmission line of this reactive power with respect to the “active” power is shown to determine whether the current lags or leads the voltage. It is urged that only one kind of reactive power (lagging) be recognized, and that its direction of flow be considered. A simplification of system operating problems is claimed to result from this view. Use of the symbol rkw is urged."
"The single-phase and polyphase definitions of reactive power are considered in this article. It is shown that the single-phase definition is unsatisfactory with complex waves. The polyphase definition is better, but requires independent recognition of distortion and mesh distribution. A distinction is made between fictitious power and reactive power."
"THE NINTH annual meeting of the North Eastern District of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers will be held at Schenectady, N. Y., from Wednesday to Friday, May 10–12, 1933. Headquarters will be at the Hotel Van Curler at which all technical sessions will take place, with the exception of the session for Thursday morning, May 11. A program consisting of 4 technical sessions, inspection trips, annual dinner and dance, and entertainment features has been arranged by the committee; also there will be a students' session on Friday May 12. A special program has been arranged for women. The technical sessions will cover the following general subjects; namely, aeronautics, air conditioning, reactive power, and selected subjects."
"In accordance with action of the board of directors, a meeting of the executive committee of the A.I.E.E. was held at Institute headquarters, New York, N. Y., March 15, 1933, in place of the regular March meeting of the board of directors."
"Principal discussion of the first 6 sessions held during the winter convention were summarized in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING for March 1933, p. 200–202. Discussions of other sessions are presented herewith. The papers to which these discussions refer were abstracted in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING for January 1933, p. 41–52, and February 1933, p. 122–24, excepting the papers given more complete treatment in these same or previous issues; additional articles based upon these papers are being presented in subsequent issues."
"During the past 10 years the committee on welded rail joints appointed by the American Bureau of Welding and the American Transit Engineering Association, has been engaged, with the cooperation of the U.S. Bureau of Standards, upon a study of welded rail joints. The purpose of the extensive investigation undertaken has been the improvement and standardization of methods of making these joints. The tests included conductivity, tensile, bend, drop, repeated impact and shear tests, as well as numerous metallurgical and miscellaneous investigations. All types of welded joints commercially used were tested and examined by the committee."

Part 1 of this second progress report is presented herewith in essentially full text, without comment, but with an open invitation for comments, criticisms, and suggestions."
"Information supplementing and confirming the studies of voltage and current waves in neon tubes published in a previous issue of ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING are presented herewith. It is shown that there is a peaked starting voltage at the beginning of each wave, the current is practically zero at this point, the time during which the current wave remains at zero is negligible for a properly processed tube, and flickering will occur if the current remains at zero for even one-third cycle. Information on transformer regulation also is given."
"Equipment that is believed to embody new and interesting features is described in this article. Further refinement in detail and further testing are necessary, however, before the apparatus can be applied to regular service. Its ultimate adoption will depend, of course, upon its ability to compete with other systems of air navigation from the standpoint of application, accuracy, simplicity, reliability, weight, size, and cost."
"An analysis of system power costs is of importance to system engineers as well as to the management, provided that the information is in a form readily usable for their particular problems. In the accompanying article is given a useful method of analysis."
"As part of the symposium on reactive power to be conducted at the Institute's Schenectady, N. Y., meeting, May 10–12, 1933, the following article discusses the relations between power, reactive volt-amperes, and power factor for sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal electromotive forces and currents. Vector equations for these relations are derived, and polyphase power and reactive volt-amperes are defined. Non-linear circuits are discussed. The method of symmetrical components is used for the analysis."
"Formerly considered useful only for constant speed service, the induction motor is becoming a motor of almost universal application. This article describes how the general characteristics of the induction motor may be varied to meet the requirements of several typical applications, some of which would have been considered impossible a few years ago."
"Standard squirrel cage motors of moderate size have been studied to determine the protection against overheating secured by standard control devices. The results of these tests on the heating of motor windings and the temperatures at which control devices function, are presented herewith in a manner easy to follow and not complicated by the more highly theoretical considerations."
"Some 40 nations of the world are linked to the United States by the radio network of R.C.A. Communications, Inc. Satisfactory commercial operation of such a system imposes upon the plant behind the service many rigorous technical requirements, some of which are described here, and the means for meeting them disclosed."
"Vacuum tube rectifiers have proved their superiority over mechanical rectifiers for supplying high voltage direct current for the precipitation of solids and liquids from gases by electrical means. In this article the general requirements for this service are outlined and a typical vacuum tube installation described."
"INTERPRETIVE abstracts of all papers scheduled for presentation at the A.I.E.E. Schenectady District meeting (May 10–12, 1933) are published herewith, excepting only: (1) those papers published in this or the preceding issue; and (2) those papers which, at the time of going to press for this issue, have not yet been made available by the authors. Members vitally interested and wishing to obtain a pamphlet copy of any paper available in that form may do so by writing to the A.I.E.E. Order Dept., 33 West 39th Street, New York, N. Y., stating title, author, and publication number of each paper desired."
"IN CONNECTION with the investigation of ionization in impregnated paper insulated cables conducted at The Harvard Engineering School under auspices of the impregnated paper cable research committee of the National Electric Light Association, it was found necessary to determine over a considerable range of voltage gradient, temperature, and frequency, the electrical characteristics of cable paper impregnated with different cable oils and compounds. The impregnation was conducted under almost ideal laboratory conditions so that little if any gas was occluded. When the results of the measurements were rationalized and analyzed, it was found that to a remarkable degree they all conformed to the same general laws. These laws and the analyses of the electrical characteristics into components may appear to be only empirical. However, they are results of some fundamental causes, involving probably molecular and intramolecular reactions. Therefore, aside from any value which the results presented may have as engineering data, they may at some time be of value in confirming or in disproving some more fundamental theories of dielectrics. Moreover, it is found that actual cables when impregnated so thoroughly that they manifest no appreciable ionization, have electrical characteristics comparable to those obtained with these samples impregnated under almost ideal conditions. The conclusions presented in this paper are as follows: 1. An abrupt change in the slope of the cooling curves of some cable compounds occurs in the neighborhood of 50 deg C; this may indicate changes in the molecular structure. 2. It appears to be a general law that the power loss in cable compounds varies as a constant exponential power of the voltage gradient, the exponent usually being 2 at room temperature; at higher temperatures it may be greater or less than 2. 3. The power factor characteristics of cable compounds are exponential functions of the voltage gradient, the exponent being related to that for the power characteristics. 4. The power-frequency characteristics are essentially linear, having a positive intercept at zero frequency. 5. The power factor-frequency characteristics are essentially rectangular hyperbolas. 6. The equivalent series resistivity-voltage gradient characteristic is the same type of function as the power factor-voltage gradient characteristic. 7. The equivalent parallel conductivity-voltage gradient characteristic is the same type of function as the power factor-voltage gradient characteristic. 8. The power-temperature characteristics for constant frequency and constant voltage gradient appear to consist of 2 terms, each of which is a constantexponential function of the temperature. (A.I.E.E. paper No. 33–58)"
"CORE-LOSS and excitation characteristics of sheet steel subjected to combined alternating and direct magnetic fields, have been subjects of investigation for the past 20 years. Such combined fields occur in many types of electrical apparatus. This paper presents the results of a series of 60-cycle core-loss and excitation tests with superposed d-c excitation, which recently were made on silicon sheet steel."
"DUE TO increased production demands, the speed at which resistance welders operate has been stepped up as much as 4 to 5 times during the last few years. This has been made possible in a large degree, by the development of new switching mechanisms that will allow a current dwell of a fraction of a cycle on 60-cycles."
"GENERAL definitions exist for potential, current, and active and reactive power, that are independent of wave form and of circuit conditions. In order to use these quantities in circuit analysis when there are harmonics present, it is necessary to know their individual harmonic components. By definition, singlephase power factor is a blanket factor which covers and so disregards any deviation in wave form from the sinusoidal. Thus it is not a quantity that can be used in circuit analysis when there are harmonics present. If polyphase power factor is defined as the ratio of the power to the magnitude of the vector volt-amperes it is likewise a useless quantity in circuit analysis if there are harmonics present. Furthermore, this definition of polyphase power factor makes it a derived quantity which depends upon the active and reactive power. Even when there are no harmonics present so that power factor may be legitimately used, the circuit calculations are usually simpler if the loads are determined by their active and reactive powers rather than by their power factors. That is, as far as circuit analysis is concerned, power factor is a quantity whose retirement need scarcely be noted."
"THE CHARACTER of the quantity known as reactive volt-amperes is first discussed and its dependence upon the assumption of a definite type of periodicity is brought out, this in contrast to certain other a-c quantities. It is pointed out that on account of the rather complicated relation that it bears to the flow of energy in an electric circuit, serious difficulties are met in its measurement except in the simpler conditions of balanced voltages, in a polyphase circuit, and sinusoidal waves. Two procedures are outlined which though they are not premised on balanced voltages have frequency and wave form limitations."
"THE 49th annual summer convention of the A.I.E.E., to be held in Chicago, Ill, June 26–30, 1933, concurrent with “A Century of Progress International Exposition,” offers unusually attractive features. The summer convention committee has arranged a number of joint activities, entertainment features, trips and sports which, combined with an excellent technical program, assure a pleasurable and profitable week. Convention headquarters will be at the Edgewater Beach Hotel on the shore of Lake Michigan."
"WITH the Institute's annual summer convention scheduled for Chicago during the fourth week of the 1933 international exposition, there is available to Institute members a most unusual opportunity for an interesting and a highly profitable vacation trip. Convention details have been outlined on preceding pages; a few of the many exposition features are mentioned briefly on these facing pages, the tremendous scope of the exposition program precluding even a comprehensive outline here."
"THE 80th birthday of Prof. Elihu Thomson (A'84, F'13. HM'28, member for life, and past-president), dean of electrical engineers, was celebrated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, on Wednesday, March 29, 1933, by a scientific conference, an historical exhibit, and a testimonial dinner. The celebration was arranged by a committee of 45, representing Professor Thomson's earliest associates, the scientific and professional societies, the electrical industries, and education. Prof. D. C. Jackson (A'87, F'12, and past-president), head of the department of electrical engineering of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was chairman of the committee."
"The Institute's North Eastern District meeting will be held in Schenectady, N. Y., May 10–12, 1933, with headquarters at the Hotel Van Curler, which is located a short distance from the main entrance to the General Electric Company's Schenectady works. The program of the Schenectady District meeting was announced in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING for April 1933, p. 271–3; abstracts of all papers available at the time of going to press are included in the present issue."
"CONTRIBUTIONS to these columns are invited from Institute members and subscribers. They should be concise and may deal with technical papers, articles published in previous issues, or other subjects of some general interest and professional importance. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING will endeavor to publish as many letters as possible, but of necessity reserves the right to publish them in whole or in part, or to reject them entirely."

"The board of examiners, at its recent meeting recommended the members listed for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objection to these transfers should be filed at once with the national secretary."
"G-E Develops Oil, Heat-Resisting Cable. — A new cable insulated with Glyptal-treated cloth and capable of resisting oil and withstanding high temperatures has been developed by the General Electric Company and is now available in all types. In addition to its ability to resist oil and heat, this new cable is characterized by unusual flexibility and toughness that enables it to stand severe mechanical strain. The insulating material known as Glyptal is a synthetic resin, produced from phthalic anhydride and glycerine, which is unaffected by mineral oil. Because of this inherent quality, Glyptal-treated cloth has a distinct advantage over varnish-treated cloths as an insulation material. This new cloth also maintains its original properties over long periods of time, even at elevated temperatures. Samples of cable insulated with Glyptal-treated cloth have been exposed to temperatures of 100 degrees C. for periods of three to four months without showing appreciable deterioration. The new cable can be used advantageously for low- and medium-voltage leads, apparatus cable, transformer leads, leads for coils and control devices, or wherever an oil-resisting, heat-resisting cable is required."

"DURING this period of serious industrial depression some members of the Institute, and of other professional societies as well, have found it necessary or considered it expedient to resign their membership. This has been a misfortune for the Institute and an even greater misfortune, I believe for the individuals concerned. Indications now are that we are passing through the final stages of this depression and that it shortly will be followed by a period of prosperity during which engineers and recent graduates of engineering colleges again will find ready employment in industry."
"Air conditioning, having already proved its worth in theaters and auditoriums, now is being developed for the home. In this article are discussed equipment and energy requirements for both complete and partial air conditioning of typical homes in various climates. The electrical load that would accrue from a widespread use of this type of equipment also is discussed from the standpoint of the electrical utilities."
"ASSUMING that satisfactory 66-kv cable could be obtained, the Commonwealth Edison Company, Chicago, Ill., in 1926 adopted a new system plan1 which included 66-kv underground lines of 60,000-kva carrying capacity that practically constituted a bus extending across the city and sectionalized at the generating stations. The record of failures on this cable, which began shortly after it was placed in operation late in 1926, gave unmistakable evidence (Fig. 1) that this assumption was not entirely warranted; and, further, that there were some marked differences in the quality of the insulation furnished by the different manufacturers. There resulted a great impetus to the investigations2,3 on cable for lower operating voltages that had been in progress in Chicago for several years."
"Development of the power resources of that portion of the St. Lawrence River which forms part of the boundary between the United States and Canada, for many years has been studied by engineers and talked by politicians; and neither the end of the discussion nor the start of construction is yet in sight. Equal in magnitude of power output, but not of expenditure, is the Beauharnois development of the Soulanges section of this same river, a wholly Canadian enterprise the initial installation of which is now in operation. The power canal of this development will form an integral part of the proposed St. Lawrence waterway. This article describes the project as a whole in a general way and presents in more detail the principal features of the electrical installation."
"Several recent developments in the application of electricity in industry are mentioned in the report of the Institute's committee on general power applications presented herewith."
"Lack of precise time measuring apparatus for athletic and other sporting events has led to the development of an electric timing system which is accurate to within 0.005 sec for short races and within 0.01 sec for a mile race. This system utilizes a synchronous electric clock and a high speed motion picture camera to photograph simultaneously the runner and the clock dials at the finish of the race. It was put to a practical test in the 1932 Olympics held in Los Angeles, Calif."
"Recent developments in the 5 major classes of electrical machinery are outlined in the following report of the Institute's committee on electrical machinery. Considerable operating experience with equipment previously developed was secured and also is summarized."
"In an effort to determine present operating practice relative to the installation and performance of high voltage lightning arresters on electric power systems, the A.I.E.E. subcommittee on lightning arresters and the N.E.L.A. subject committee on lightning arresters circulated a joint questionnaire on that subject to 22 companies in various parts of the United States. Data obtained in the replies to the questionnaire are summarized in this report. While it is believed somewhat premature to draw definite conclusions, nevertheless certain definite trends may be observed."
"In spite of the fact that there has been little new construction, numerous developments of electricity in the production of iron and steel were made during the past year. These are outlined in the following report of the Institute's committee on applications to iron and steel production."
"A resume of relaying of high voltage transmission lines is presented in this article, with particular reference to the factors which must be considered on interconnections. The various types of relays in use are summarized from an operating engineer's point of view and conclusions are drawn. It is shown that the most satisfactory schemes are very expensive and the cheaper schemes are not entirely effective. A theoretical solution is proposed."
"An improved method for providing electrical breakdown tests of rubber covered wire has been developed which for telephone wire presents many advantages. The previously used water test has been replaced by a dry test, and one machine combines the testing and coiling operations. Details of the method are presented in this article."
"INTERPRETIVE abstracts of all papers definitely scheduled for presentation at the A.I.E.E. summer convention (June 26–30, 1933) are published herewith, excepting only those papers published in this issue of ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING."
"HIGH speed distance relays are rapidly establishing a new conception of system protection and are bringing to the front a different technique in relay testing. The inherent speed of distance relays makes it difficult to test them by watching indicating meters and relay motions during operation. Recent improvements in portable oscillographs have increased the utility of such equipment for tests of distance relays and to a lesser extent for tests on the older types of relays."
"A MEDIUM-speed cathode-ray oscillograph with a rotating film has been built for the study of circuit breaker transients. The film is wrapped around a drum and rotated in the vacuum at high speed. Each film shows in a continuous trace, a complete story of the formation of arc, subsequent reignitions and final extinction. More than 15 complete cycles may be recorded without excessive blurring. Each film is self-calibrated."
"IMPROVEMENTS in circuit breakers have been accelerated by the availability of short-circuit testing laboratories. Some of these laboratories are of sufficient capacity to test circuit breakers of reasonably high interrupting ratings at their full rated current and voltage. No laboratory, however, has sufficient capacity to make such tests on the largest circuit breakers now used. It has therefore been necessary to study the fundamentals of circuit interruption within the limits of laboratory equipment. Also, much study has been given to the determination of the differences between field service and testing conditions."
"THE totally enclosed fuses employed to protect lowvoltage low-current distribution circuits perform their work so effectively and quietly that an analysis has been made to determine their principle of operation in order that this principle might be applied to a small circuit breaker."
"OUTSTANDING economies can be effected by metering high voltage loads on the low voltage side of the power transformers. A compensating meter in combination with a watthour meter, both connected to instrument transformers on the low voltage side, provides accuracy equal to, and in some cases better than, metering on the high voltage side. The method permits the use of low voltage current transformers of relatively greater thermal and mechanical limits and of improved accuracy, in comparison with high voltage current transformers of relatively smaller current ratings."
"A SIMPLIFIED portable oscillograph having a number of new optical and electrical features is described in this paper. The optical system, which consists of a combination of cylindrical lenses with axes at right angles, is designed to permit simultaneous viewing and photographing. A continuous time axis for both the viewing screen and film is secured by means of a small, variable speed, revolving mirror."
"AN ANALYSIS of the requirements for satisfactory operation of the simple 4-arm bridge when used for impedance measurements is given in this paper. The various forms of bridge are classified into 2 major types called the ratio-arm type and the product-arm type, based on the location of the fixed impedance arms in the bridge. These 2 types are subdivided further, based upon the phase relation which exists between the fixed arm impedances. Eight practical forms of bridges are given, 3 of them being duplicate forms from the standpoint of the method of measuring impedance. These bridges together allow the measurement of any type of impedance in terms of practically any type of adjustable standard. The use of partial substitution methods and of resonance methods with these bridges is discussed and several methods of operation are described which show their flexibility in the measurement of impedance."
"ELECTRICAL measuring instruments play an important part in the generation, distribution, and sale of electrical power, and in the development and testing of electrical machinery. The accuracy of electrical measuring instruments depends as much upon the quality of the control springs as on the design of the torque producing elements."
"THE EXPULSION protective gap consists of a fiber tube of proper bore and dimensions so arranged with an internal gap that lightning discharges are conducted within the tube and the power follow current is stopped through the expulsion action of the tube. Its action during interruption of follow current is similar to that of the expulsion fuse. In practice the expulsion gap is provided with a series gap, the whole assembly being electrically in parallel with the insulation to be protected."
"ON POWER transmission lines a flashover due to lightning usually results in a power arc and a line outage. The deion flashover protector, a device intended for the protection of insulation such as used on transmission lines, provides a path for the spark where the resulting power arc can be extinguished without causing a system disturbance. Electrodes within a tube serve as spark and arc terminals. The walls of the tube are made of such material that the arc generates a gas which assists in extinguishing the arc. An external air gap is usually placed between the tube and the line."
"IT IS generally agreed that the most important factor limiting the life of the so-called solid type of impregnated paper insulated cable is internal ionization in voids or gas pockets. The much higher stresses in oil filled cables and their exceptional performance in service are commonly attributed to the absence of gaseous ionization. These facts have served to draw increased attention to the question of the type of oil to be used in such cables. The oils for solid cables have been selected from the standpoint of their susceptibility to the formation and ultimate action of internal ionization. With ionization absent, as in the oil filled cable, the question then becomes one of the inherent dielectric and insulating properties of the oil."
"IMPROVEMENT in cables, which combine liquid and solid dielectrics, has come largely through the study and control of gaseous electrical phenomena. This is because through circumstances of use in the field, gases enter the cable structure and the resulting electrical discharges in these gas layers cause deterioration ultimately leading to failure. The steps in improvement have successively led first to the abandonment of the heavy solids or petrolatums as treating materials and then to the oil filled cable, where the possibility of entrapped and dissolved gases is reduced to the minimum possible."
"IINVESTIGATION of the radial variation in electrical and chemical characteristics of cable insulation between conductor and sheath is suggested as a valuable means for throwing light on cable deterioration in service. A cell is described for the rapid accurate measurement of power factor of individual paper tapes taken from cable. A method is given for determining the total oxidation products in the oil from the paper tapes, layer by layer, from sheath to conductor. The results obtained by applying these methods to several types of service-aged cables are reported, together with the indications which they give of the relative importance of ionization and oxidation as aging factors."
"IN ORDER to meet future demands for high-grade and economical circuits in cables, considerable carrier development work has been done which has included an extensive experimental installation on a 25-mile loop of underground cable. Sufficient pairs were provided in the cable and repeaters were installed to set up 9 carrier telephone circuits 850 miles long. Tests on these circuits showed the quality of transmission to be satisfactory, while the methods and devices adopted to prevent interference between them were found to be adequate. The trial has, therefore, demonstrated that the obtaining of large numbers of carrier telephone circuits from cable is a practicable proposition."
"AN ANALYTICAL discussion of some of the important decisions reached in the design of the new Port Washington power plant is presented in this paper. This generating station, now under construction, is located on the west shore of Lake Michigan at East Port Washington, Wis., 28 miles north of Milwaukee. The initial section of the station, with one turbine, will have a capacity of 80,000 kw, and will utilize 1,230 lb steam pressure and 825 deg F steam temperature at the throttle, and 825 deg F steam pressure at the reheat point. It will be built on the unit design, one boiler per turbine, one set of transformers, one 132-kv transmission line, and one set of auxiliaries for each unit. The possible ultimate capacity of the station is 400,000 kw in 5 units."
"THE RECENT development at Burlington generating station of the Public Service Electric and Gas Company of New Jersey is of special interest in these days of stringent economies and efforts to make existing equipment go as far as possible. The station contained 3 12,500-kw turbine-generators from 10 to 16 years old with a stoker fired boiler plant all operating at 200 lb steam pressure with 150 deg superheat; the fuel consumption was 22,000 to 25,000 Btu per kwhr which is about what would be expected with these steam conditions and equipment of that period."
"THIS paper determines first the electrical torques due to short circuit as considered from 2 points of view — a machine without losses, and then including losses. The further calculation of the mechanical torques, i. e., shaft and coupling torques, torque reactions in spring mounted machines, etc., shows that the loss torques can result in as serious mechanical stresses as the alternating torque components, though the latter be higher. This is due to the effect of the “transmission factor” discussed in the paper. The calculation of stator stresses shows them to be low, even under a short-circuit torque which is considered to act undiminished because of stator frame rigidity."
"THE problem of arc stability with d-c welding generators is first analyzed in this paper and the nature of the welding arc is studied. The mechanism of instability is analyzed."
"ALTH0UGH the design of so-called standard resistance welders is more or less fixed, the construction of a special resistance welding machine involves a series of design factors which are only approximate and for which one allows large limits. An attempt is made to outline the elementary features of construction for successful operation by enumerating the factors which must be known. A method of obtaining the proper transformer capacity, types of switches for changing the amount of welding current, and means for regulating the time of application of the current are indicated. Important mechanical conditions to be considered are also touched upon."
"THE PRINCIPLE of building the larger capacity rectifiers in sectional form was discussed in a paper presented before the Institute at the 1932 winter convention. Obviously, the successful achievement of a sectional rectifier, without its becoming prohibitively large, involved the development of a rectifier section much reduced in size from the familiar conventional rectifier of 500 kw to 1,000 kw capacity. Due to the characteristics of the device, this reduction in size of section inevitably resulted in a corresponding reduction in arc drop with a further enhancing of the advantage of the sectional arrangement. The design was based on a 1,250-amp section, which is approximately the rating above which difficulties due to size begin. The 1932 paper briefly described the first design of sectional rectifier. Since that time, considerable improvement has been made both as to performance and convenience of operation. The present paper describes the 2,000-kw 625-volt unit being installated on the Fulton Street line of the independent subway system of the city of New York for the New York board of transportation. This unit is typical for any capacity above 750 kw at 600 volts. The paper also briefly describes smaller rectifiers for capacities below 750 kw."
"MERCURY arc rectifiers have current and voltage wave shapes which are inherent in the normal operation of the apparatus. It is the object of this paper to discuss the wave shape on both the a-c and d-c side of rectifiers and to show how to estimate the wave shapes of the voltage and the current on either side under operating conditions when the circuit constants are known."
"SHORT time transients such as lightning waves and switching surges cause very high o ver-voltages in transformers due to high amplitudes of these voltages allowed by transmission line insulation and the non-uniform distribution of such voltages throughout the winding and internal resonance. The internal stresses can be reduced by limiting the amplitude of the impulse waves (gaps and lightning arresters), by changing their shape (wave modifiers), by making voltage distribution uniform throughout the winding irrespective of the shape of the wave (electrostatic shielding of the windings) or by a combination of these means. Coil, turn, and major insulation (except at line end) transient voltages are reduced far more by making the voltage distribution uniform throughout the winding then by reducing the amplitude of the applied wave by any means available at present."
"THE results of a photographic study of successive steps in the kindling process of impulse-flashover in unsymmetrical dielectric fields are presented in this paper. In order to keep the experimental conditions as simple as possible, the investigation was limited to the initial or kindling stage of impulse-sparkover and the energy content of the impressed potential impulse was kept very small to minimize, as much as possible, the thermionic effects."
"AFTER some 10 years of experience in the application of “3-circuit theory” to a variety of transformer problems, some limitations are encountered in the application of the elementary theory to certain types of problems. The purpose of this paper is to point out what these limitations are and how they may be circumvented."
"AT SEDENTARY occupations under normal indoor winter conditions the human body loses heat at the rate of 400 Btu per hr, of which approximately 46 per cent is radiated, 30 per cent is convected, and 24 per cent is lost by the evaporation of moisture from skin and lungs. The skin and clothing surface temperatures average around 80 deg F. With solid surroundings at 80 deg F, therefore, there would be no heat loss by radiation. Any intermediate temperature between the normally prevailing inside wall temperature and 80 deg F would mean a corresponding modification in the amount of heat radiated. Compensation for this decrease in radiated heat may be effected by lowering the air temperature The effect on human comfort of thus controlling the amount of heat radiated from the body is given in this paper. The possibility of using electric energy for this application, together with equipment and operating costs, is also given."
"SEVERAL articles of recent years have shown the importance of the problem of reignition of a-c arcs in air between copper electrodes. Recently, 2 of the present authors described the conditions controlling the rate of voltage rise across the arc electrodes during the interval of cyclic current zero and its relation to the rate of deionization of the gap. The arc reignites if the circuit constants permit the arc electrodes to experience a voltage rise of rapidity sufficient to overcome the growing dielectric strength of the arc space."
"THIS paper purports to answer certain pertinent questions in regard to the operation of primary networks under normal and abnormal conditions with particular emphasis on the interrelated effects of voltage regulation, load distribution, and circulating currents. The conclusions offered are substantiated by calculated data, calculating board analyses, and test data on actual systems in operation."
"FINAL arrangements for the 49th annual summer convention of the A.I.E.E. to be held at Chicago, Ill., June 26–30, 1933, during Engineers' Week at the World's Fair, have been completed. All planning to attend this convention should register in advance if possible; please fill in and mail the advance registration card which has been sent to you with the mailed announcement.

"Emphasizing the effects of science and engineering upon the life of man, and the basic need for a better understanding of these effects throughout human society, President Charlesworth in addressing the annual summer convention at Chicago urged engineers to take a greater part in all affairs affecting human welfare. That the message may reach the entire membership, the full text is published herewith. — The Editors."
"In this brief discussion Mr. Lee in his characteristically interesting manner outlines what engineers have accomplished in mitigating the damaging effects of lightning on electric power transmission lines. Although all problems have not yet been solved, substantial progress has been recorded."
"The radial variation in electrical and chemical characteristics of cable insulation between conductor and sheath has been investigated by a new method whereby the power factor and the total oxidation products in the oil are determined for the individual layers of paper tapes. The results of this investigation applied to several types of service aged cable are reported in this article."
"Outstanding economies can be effected by metering high voltage loads on the low voltage side of power transformers, a practical method of which is described in this article. A compensating meter is used in combination with a watthour meter, both connected to instrument transformers on the low voltage side; accuracy is equal to, and sometimes better than, metering on the high voltage side. Calculations illustrating the practical application of the method, and performance data for an actual installation are given."
"Since the sectional mercury arc rectifier was introduced a few years ago, many improvements have been made in the design of the rectifier unit as regards both performance and convenience of operation. These improvements have been incorporated in the design of the 3,000-kw 625-volt rectifiers being supplied for the New York City Independent Subway System. Performance of these new units and factors determining design features are discussed in this article."
"This article describes experiments in the heating of a small room by controlled radiation from electrically heated panels in the walls; from the results has been determined a practical method of predicting relative comfort for various combinations of wall and air temperatures. It is claimed that low temperature radiant heating in combination with reversed refrigeration would so lower the operating cost of electric heating as to make it competitive with heating by other fuels."
"Staged tests on high speed distance relays involving the placing of artificial short circuits on high voltage transmission lines not only eliminate much of the low voltage testing, but give a more complete check on the functioning of apparatus. Planning and procedure of staged tests are discussed in this article."
"The possibility of recovery of the fibrillating heart has been the subject of extensive experimental work, the results of which demonstrate conclusively that normal rhythmic functioning can be restored successfully in many cases."
"Considerable development work on carrier in cable has included an extensive installation on a 25-mile loop of underground cable. Sufficient pairs were provided in the cable and repeaters installed to set up 9 carrier telephone circuits 850 miles long. Tests showed transmission quality to be satisfactory, and adequate prevention of interference was secured. The obtaining of large numbers of carrier telephone circuits from cable was proved to be practicable."
"The installation of a new boiler and high-back-pressure non-condensing turbine which exhausts into 3 older turbines, reduced the fuel consumption at the Burlington station from 22,000–25,000 Btu per kwhr to about 15,000 Btu per kwhr. Electrical and mechanical details in the improvement of the station are described in this article."
"A POPULAR discussion of X rays which may serve to clarify some of the fundamentals of this subject to those readers of ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING not too familiar with these and other highly penetrating waves, was presented recently by Dr. W. D. Coolidge (A'10) director of the research laboratory of the General Electric Company, Schenectady, N. Y. Doctor Coolidge's talk follows:"
"Following its previously adopted custom, the A.I.E.E. committee on power generation presents in this report a survey of developments in the generation of electric power during the past 2 years. General trends in steam plant practice have been toward higher pressures and temperatures; trends in power plant design have been toward simplification, rehabilitation, and increased economy of operation. In the hydro-electric field an increasing application of the propeller type turbine in low head plants has been noted, with some indication that in the future the regenerative cycle may have a wider application in the United States than it has had in the past."
"The 49th annual summer convention of the A.I.E.E. held in Chicago, Ill., during Engineers' Week, June 26–30, 1933, was under way as this issue went to press, and will be reported in detail in the August issue of ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING."
"In addition to the national and District prizes for papers presented before the Institute during the calendar year 1932, as announced in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING for June 1933, p. 424–5, announcement now has been made of the award of prizes for District No. 8."
"With President Charlesworth presiding, the annual meeting of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers was held at the Edgewater Beach Hotel, Chicago, Ill., as the opening session of the annual summer convention, June 26, 1933."
"Formal announcement of the election of 6 prominent individuals to honorary membership in the Institute was made at the annual meeting held during the 49th annual summer convention, Chicago, Ill., June 26, 1933. These new honorary members, all elected by unanimous vote of the Institute's board of directors at its meeting of May 22, 1933 are as follows:"
"PRINCIPAL discussions of the Schenectady meeting papers are summarized herewith. The papefs to which these discussions refer were abstracted in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING for May 1933, p. 341–2, excepting the papers given more complete treatment in this issue or the previous issue."

"Bristol Co. Moves Local Quarters. — The Bristol Co., Waterbury, Conn., makers of indicating, recording, and controlling instruments, announces that the New York office is now located in the Daily News Building, 220 East 42nd St. C. N. Williamson, district manager, continues in charge, assisted by a staff of six application and service engineers."
"Pulp insulation is a new type of insulation that has been developed to replace the well-known spirally wrapped ribbon paper insulation in certain kinds of telephone cables. It consists of a continuous pulp sleeving formed directly on the wire by a modified paper making process. The raw material for this insulation is commercial Kraft pulp and its preparatory treatment in the beaters corresponds to that given in the regular paper making process."
"A number of types of measurement are made on telephone circuits to determine their transmission performance, these measurements being made with manually operated devices. This paper describes a transmission measuring system which automatically records the results of many of these measurements."
"Part I of this paper contributes methods, theorems, formulas and graphs to meet a previously unfilled need in dealing with certain types of two-dimensional probability problems — especially those relating to alternating current transmission systems and networks, in which the variables occur naturally in complex form and thus are two-dimensional. The paper is concerned particularly with “normal” probability functions (distribution functions) in two dimensions, which are analogous to the familiar “ normal” probability functions in one-dimensional probability problems. It supplies a comprehensive set of graphs for the probability that a “normal” complex chance-variable deviates from its mean value by an amount whose magnitude (absolute value) exceeds any stated value; in other words, the probability that the chance-variable lies without any specified circle centered at the mean value in the plane of its “scatter-diagram,” that is, in the complex plane of the chance-variable. It gives a comprehensive treatment of the distribution-parameters of the “normal” complex chance-variable, and convenient formulas for the necessary evaluation of these parameters. For use in various portions of the paper, as well as for various possible outside uses, it supplies a considerable number of formulas and theorems on “mean values” (“expected values”) of complex chance-variables."
"Efforts to extend the frequency range of oscillographs have, for the most part, been directed toward increasing the natural frequency of the vibrating element, which has formed the upper limit of the useful range. This paper describes a new method of attack which consists in employing a vibrator strung to only a moderately high natural frequency, and in equalizing the response of the string by electrical circuits both up to and beyond the fundamental resonance frequency. Employing this method of equalization, a galvanometer element has been developed for the rapid record oscillograph which uses strings stretched to a natural frequency of 4500 c.p.s., and equalized to from ten to twelve thousand cycles. The paper concludes with a description of such a modified rapid record oscillograph and with an oscillogram illustrating its use."
"This article on high-frequency phenomena in gases, a continuation of the one which appeared in the preceding number of this Journal, is concerned with the self-sustaining high-frequency discharges. First come the conditions for establishment of the discharge, a spark or corona if the gas-pressure is high, a glow if it is low; then, the laws of the glow-discharge when established in rarefied gas, in tubes with internal or external electrodes. The complexity of the situation is such that fundamental theory is almost powerless as yet, the article thus consisting chiefly of descriptions of data and statements of empirical laws."
"In January, 1932, a series of seven lectures by representatives of the Bell Telephone System was given before the Lowell Institute of Boston, Massachusetts. The general title of the series was “The Application of Science in Electrical Communication.”"
"In order to meet future demands for high-grade and economical circuits in cables, considerable carrier development work has been done which has included an extensive experimental installation on a 25-mile loop of underground cable. Sufficient pairs were provided in the cable and repeaters were installed to set up nine carrier telephone circuits 850 miles long. Tests on these circuits showed the quality of transmission to be satisfactory, while the methods and devices adopted to prevent interference between them were found to be adequate. The trial has, therefore, demonstrated that the obtaining of large numbers of carrier telephone circuits from cable is a practicable proposition."
"This paper presents a formula for the mutual impedance of any insulated wires of negligible diameter lying in horizontal planes above the surface of the earth and grounded by vertical wires at their four end-points. The formula holds for frequencies which are not too high to allow all displacement currents to be neglected. Tables and curves are given to facilitate numerical computation by means of the formula. In the expansion of this formula for low frequencies and for any heights the first two terms give the direct-current mutual impedance; the third term is independent of the heights, thus being identically the same as that previously found for wires on the surface. The mutual impedance for wires at any heights H and h, with separations large in comparison with these heights, is found to be approximately equal to the mutual impedance for wires on the surface multiplied by the complex factor [1 + Γ(H + h)], where Γ is the propagation constant in the earth."
"This article, like its forerunners on radioactivity and transmutation, is devoted to the beginnings of the oncoming stage of atomic physics: the study of the nucleus. The nucleus or kernel of an atom is in ultimate control of all its properties and features, for such of these as do not depend directly on it depend upon the number and arrangement of the orbital electrons, both of which are decided by the nuclear charge; further, the atomic weight is decided almost exclusively by the nuclear mass. Though in dealing with most of these properties it is usual to imagine the nucleus as a geometrical point endowed with mass and charge, the truth is far less simple and more interesting. Nuclei are structures built of elementary particles — some and maybe all of which are independently known to us — bound tightly together. It is of great importance to ascertain these structures, not only for their own sake, but because through understanding them we may become able to control and extend the transformations of nuclei from one kind to another — the processes of transmutation, some of which are already feasible. Several fields of research are apt to contribute to such an understanding. Accurate measurement of the masses of atoms, and of the masses and charges and other properties of the elementary particles, are the first two of these, and form the subject of the present article."
"A previous paper1 introduced the idea of rating the transmission performance of telephone circuits on the basis of repetition observations and outlined briefly a method for expressing such ratings. The present paper describes in some detail a system for presenting these data in a form suitable for engineering use and the steps required for obtaining these data from the repetition observations."
"The first part of this paper discusses the control and measurement of variable factors involved in testing telephone circuits by the articulation method and the simulation of the testing conditions in the laboratory to those of actual use; the second part describes the auxiliary apparatus by which these controls and measurements are effected. This apparatus includes a caller's control circuit, by which the caller's speech intensity may be measured and regulated independently of the circuit tested; a switching system which automatically reverses the direction of transmission between test sentences; devices for automatic and uniform agitation of carbon button transmitters; equipment for automatic measurement of the magnitude of the speech and noise waves on the circuits tested; phonographic sources of line and room noise; and a control board at which circuit elements and conditions can be changed and measured quickly. In addition, the time required to carry out a program of tests has been materially reduced by the use of equipment which analyzes the articulation data automatically and provides the test results in typewritten form immediately after each list is called."
"Theory of the Detection of Two Modulated Waves by a Lin ear Rectifier.1 Charles B. Aiken. In this paper th ere is developed a mathematical analysis of th e detect ion, by a linear rectifier, of two modul ated waves. Solutions are obtained which are man ageable over wide ranges of values of carrier ratio and degrees of modul ation. These solutions are of greater applica bility and ar e more convenient than those previously obtain ed, and give a full treatment of the action of an ideal linear rectifier under th e act ion of two modulated waves."
"Part I of this paper first describes a method of measuring attenuation and field strength in the ultra-short wave range. A résumé of some of the quantitative experiments carried out in the range between 17 mc. (17 meters) and 80 mc. (3.75 m.) and with distances up to 100 km. is then given. Two cases are included: (1) “Optical” paths over sea-water and (2) “Non-optical” paths over level and hilly country. An outstanding result is that the absolute values of the fields measured were always less than the inverse distance value. Over sea-water, the fields decreased as the frequency increased from 34 mc. (8.7 m.) to 80 mc. (3.75 m.) while the opposite trend was found over land. As a rule, the signals received were very steady, but some evidence of slow fading was obtained for certain cases when the attenuation was much greater than that for free space."
"A general formula is derived for the mutual impedance of wires embedded in a conducting medium and lying in one of two parallel planes of discontinuity in the conductivity. The general formula is quite complicated, but simplifies in a number of important cases, and summarizes the published mutual impedance formulas relating to two-layer earth and its special cases. The two most important cases are obtained by making the conductivity of one or the other of the outer regions zero. The special case in which the conductivity of the outer region adjoining the wires is zero gives the mutual impedance of any thin grounded wires lying on the surface of a horizontally stratified earth having conductivities λ1 and λ2 at depths less than or greater than b, respectively. When the conductivity of the other outer region is zero, the formula gives the mutual impedance of wires lying in the plane of separation, at the depth b. The formulas in both cases involve integrals which apparently cannot be evaluated in closed form: for practical application the use of curves of the kind given is suggested for approximate numerical results. The formulas for the special cases, of which there are 11, together with some of their limiting forms, are tabulated together for ready reference."
"In this paper there are included a discussion of the theories pertaining to the absorption of gases by metals and descriptions of actual work illustrating them. Apparatus for the analysis and measurement of gases in metals and for melting metals in vacuum are described. Information is included, also, on commercial vacuum melting methods and the results obtained."
"The results of a series of transmission experiments made in the range 3.7 to 4.7 meters and over distances up to 125 miles are reported. These observations were chiefly confined to the region reached by the directly transmitted radiation and are found in good agreement with the assumption that such transmission consists mainly of a directly transmitted radiation plus the reflection components which would be expected from the earth's contour. The residual field not thus explained consists of a more or less pronounced diffraction pattern due to the irregularities of the earth's surface. A hill-to-hill transmission has three demonstrable reflection surfaces."
"A new method of computing modulation products by means of multiple Fourier series is described. The method is used to obtain for the problem of modulation of a two-frequency wave by a rectifier a solution which is considerably simpler than any hitherto known."
"North Atlantic Ship-Shore Radio Telephone Transmission During 1930 and 1931.1 CLIFFORD N. ANDERSON. Conside ra ble data on radio tran smission were collected d uring t he years 1930 and 1931 incident al to the operation of a ship-shore radio telephone service with several passenger ships operating in the North Atlantic. This paper discusses briefly the results of an analysis of these data. Contour diagrams are given which show the variation of signal fields with distance and time of day for the various seaso ns on approximate frequencies of 4, 9, 13, and 18 megacycles. Simil ar diagrams show the distributions of commercial circuits. Curves are also shown which enable the data to be applied more generally for other conditions of noise and radiated power."
"An empirical formula for calculating the loudness of any steady sound from an analysis of the intensity and frequency of its components is developed in this article. The development is based on fundamental properties of the hearing mechanism in such a way that a scale of loudness values results. In order to determine the form of the function representing this loudness scale and of the other factors entering into the loudness formula, measurements were made of the loudness levels of many sounds, both of pure tones and of complex wave forms. These tests are described and the method of measuring loudness levels is discussed in detail. Definitions are given endeavoring to clarify the terms used and the measurement of the physical quantities which determine the characteristics of a sound wave stimulating the auditory mechanism."
"An analysis is made of the requirements for satisfactory operation of the simple four-arm bridge when used for impedance measurements. The various forms of bridge are classified into two major types called the ratio-arm type and the product-arm type, based on the location of the fixed impedance arms in the bridge. These two types are subdivided further, based on the phase relation which exists between the fixed arm impedances. Eight practical forms of bridges are given, three of them being duplicate forms from the standpoint of the method of measuring impedance. These bridges together allow the measurement of any type of impedance in terms of practically any type of adjustable standard. The use of partial substitution methods and of resonance methods with these bridges is discussed and several methods of operation are described which show their flexibility in the measurement of impedance."
"This article discusses the physical processes of induction between neighboring power and telephone lines and describes means by which certain phenomena of interest in this connection have been qualitatively demonstrated to power and telephone employees."
"Various types of musical and non-musical atmospherics occurring within the frequency range lying between 150 and 4000 c.p.s. have been studied. Particular attention is directed to two types of the former, one a short damped oscillation, apparently a multiple reflection phenomenon, and the other a varying tone of comparatively long duration, probably related to magnetic disturbances. Several quasimusical atmospherics which appear to be associated with the two more distinct types are described. Dependence of atmospheric variations on diurnal, seasonal and meteorological effects is discussed. Characteristics of audio frequency atmospherics are shown in oscillograms and graphs."
"Vacuum tube amplifiers are now regularly built into long distance telephone circuits where required to maintain their volume efficiency. Consequently, the overall volume efficiency of these circuits no longer depends to any important extent on the loss per unit length of the line wires. Instead, the efficiency is controlled by certain factors which, before amplifiers were introduced, had negligible effect. Among these factors are echo, singing or “near singing,” and crosstalk. The stability of the lines and amplifiers also becomes very important."
"The Effect of Temperature on the Emission of Electron Field Currents from Tungsten and Molybdenum.1 A. J. Ahearn. Electron field currents from the cent ral portion of long molybdenum and tungsten filaments abo ut 2.7 = 10−3 cm. in diameter have been studied. The field currents were first made stable to about 5 per cent by longcontinued conditioning treatments of temperature and high voltage under high vacuum conditions. Thermionic emission measurementsm gave the values 4.32 and 4.58 volts for the work function of the molybdenum and tun gsten, respectively, in good agreement with the accepted values for the clean met als. Emission measurements were then made at fields varying from about 5 = 105 volts/cm. to abo ut 1 = 106 volts/cm. and at temperat ures varying from 300° K. to about 2000° K. Down to abo ut 1600° K. th e therm ionic currents completely masked the field currents. Thermionic emission values below 1600° K. were obtai ned by ext rapolation. Thus the field currents at the lower temperatures were separated from the thermionic currents. Where necessary, corrections were made for the decrease in the voltage gradient accompanying the thermal expansion of the filament. The field currents were found to be independent of temperature to with in 5 percent from 300° K. to 1400° K. At temperatures higher than 1400° K. the data are consistent with the assumption that the current consists of a thermionic current plus a current which is independent of temperature. However, because of the exponential change of thermionic current with temperature a small effect of temperature on the field current could not be distinguished at temperatures higher than 1400° K. From the theory of Fowler an d Nordheim, β a factor introduced by surface irregularities, is found to be 120 for the tungsten cathode and 47 for the molybdenum one. Thus for tungsten, Houston's theory of the temperature effect is in approximate agreement with the negative results of these experiments."
"The paper describes the equipment used in the Radio City Music Hall, explains the mode of operating it, and the use of the component systems; it refers to the engineering design of the various portions of the system, their performance, and some of the installation problems involved."
"At the instance of the Projection Screens Committee an investigation of the distortion in motion picture images was initiated. Although insufficient data have been collected to justify generalization, it appears that the distortion that may be tolerated by the average spectator is greater than one might at first suppose. The paper discusses the subject particularly from the viewing and projecting angles."
"The stylizing of many motion picture stars and the suppressing of their natural selves has reduced them to mere “fashion comers” and robbed them of their continued popular appeal. We have forgotten that a sincere emotional release is more important. Instead of this training in conventionalized deportment the artist needs instruction in coordinating the various bodily functions rhythmically for vocal production—and release of personality, for a close relation exists between physical obstructions to the free vocal production and psychological obstructions to the release of the personality. The motion picture engineer and the director would find it vastly to their advantage to know more of both the mechanics and psychology of vocal production."
"A description of the methods used in the periodic testing of the Type IIb sensitometers used in the laboratories in Hollywood. Data are presented to show the order of agreement among the several instruments."
"The motion picture program of the U. S. Department of Agriculture contemplates a gradual changeover from silent to sound films, largely of the lecture type. A few sound films have been made, but realization of plans for distribution has been slow for these reasons; (1) The depression has hit farmers harder than any other class. Most of our 4000 County Agricultural Agents can not now buy sound equipment at any price; (2) the cost of portable sound equipment has been outrageously high; (3) uncertainty as to the ultimate development of 16-mm. sound-on-film equipment has tended to delay decisions as to the purchase of equipment. The Department feels that there can be no notable development in the field of educational sound films until very cheap and efficient sound equipment is available."
"Desired “takes” are preselected from rolls of sound film shot on production, only takes required for printing being developed. Undeveloped “out” takes are reversed, spliced together, and later used for printing “dailies.” The methods of “breaking down” the predeveloped negative, necessary precautions, and the economies effected are described in detail."
"The preselection method, which permits sound track negative that has been exposed and rejected to be salvaged and used again, is discussed with particular emphasis on the economies achieved at Warner Bros. Studios by applying the method. Large savings in film and laboratory costs have been made possible without investing additional funds in equipment or changing the ordinary recording, processing, or editing routines in the slightest degree."
"The history of the animated cartoon is traced from the earliest devices used to depict motion, before the introduction of photographic processes, to the realistic and artistic colored cartoons of the present day. The various innovations developed for reducing the labor and cost of producing the thousands of different photographs in seriatim for motion picture cartoons, is described briefly in relation to their chronology and application."
"In the year 1879 at the age of 19 I had read much of a Mr. Edison in America and his scientific experiments, and so wrote to him to inquire whether he would take me on his staff of experimenters (Fig. 1). His reply was not encouraging."
"A portable sound-on-film projection equipment using 16-mm. film is described. The film is standard with the exception that one row of sprocket holes is omitted to provide space for the sound track. The projector is only slightly larger than the average silent picture projector. A detailed description of its mechanical, electrical, and optical features is given. — The complete equipment is mounted in three carrying cases, one for the projector, one for the amplifier, and one for the loud speaker and screen. The projector case serves also as a sound-proof housing when the equipment is in operation. The rewind, splicer, cables, spare tubes and lamps, and the films are located in the case for the loud speaker and screen. Each of the carrying cases weighs approximately 40 pounds, making the total weight of the equipment 120 pounds."
"A portable sound recording system is described, which weighs less than 100 pounds, is easily operated, and produces high-quality results when used in combination with a single-film recording camera."
"A rather simple form of non-intermittent 16-mm. camera that seems to be especially well suited for high-speed motion-picture photography has been developed. Film under tension is pulled continuously by a sprocket across a gate that has an aperture enlarged in the vertical dimension. The image is displaced optically to follow the film by means of a uniformly rotating plane parallel plate of glass located between the lens and the film. Framing is accomplished by small uniformly rotating blades, the edges of which follow the frame lines of the picture down as the film moves. — The camera can be run at speeds as high as 2500 pictures a second. Two forms of the camera have been developed for use with the precision liming clock, one designed for race timing by the Kirby system, having an operating speed of 120 frames per second, the other using a camera with a maximum speed of 2500 frames per second."
"The new 16-mm. Ciné-Kodak Special and a new tripod made by the Eastman Kodak Co. are described. Features of the camera include a dissolve shutter, a turret which carries any two of a series of interchangeable lenses, a reflex focusing finder, a spring motor with long uniform run characteristics, controlled speed from 8 to 64 frames per second, interchangeable film chambers having capacities of 100 and 200 feet, single-exposure trip, single-frame-per-turn and eight-frame-per-turn hand crank or motor drive shafts, and masks for double exposure and effect photography. The tripod has twist lock legs, and a smoothly operating panoraming and tilting head."
"After reviewing briefly the requirements of portable and semi-portable recorders in general, a semi-portable and a portable recorder employing the Zetka-Canady glow lamp are described. The features involved in the design of the types A and Q glow lamps are discussed, with particular reference to the electrical and optical characteristics of the systems."
"A description of the work and purposes of the Motion Picture Research Council is presented, followed by an interpretation of some of the results of this work as regards (1) child receptivity, (2) memory, (3) emotional stress, (4) attitude, and (5) behavior patterns induced by viewing motion pictures. The unexploited motion picture fields are said to be those of (1) teaching pictures, (2) juvenile entertainment (3) entertainment for a large class of adults who do not apparently attend the motion picture theaters for various reasons, and (4) the creation of good-will for the future in respect of adult education, documentary or historical films, and scientific films."
"The problem of gaining “distance” in motion picture photography, in contradistinction to that of achieving close-ups, has led to the development of telephoto objectives. When it is required that the focus be increased to a large extent, and if the aperture be kept within the usual range, the length of the required attachment and the diameter of the Front lens become rather impracticable."
"Standardization in America is discussed in relation to the classification of standards as company, association, national, and international standards. The function of the American Standards Association and the standardizing activities of the United States Government are described. Considerable attention is given to the factors that should be considered in deciding whether to standardize, and as to the methods to be followed in standardizing. The paper closes with a discussion of the human factor in standardization projects, and the responsibilities of participating groups and individuals engaged in standardizing."
"The history of the Society in respect to its standardizing activities is traced from the date of organization, July, 1916, to October 5, 1932. One of the principal reasons for the formation of the Society was “the standardization of mechanisms and practices” employed in the motion picture art, the constant application of which principle has resulted in a large group of standards formulated by the Society for the motion picture industry during the sixteen years of its existence. The standards so formulated have become recognized internationally, and undoubtedly have contributed enormously to the rapid advancement of the art."
"The production of sound-film prints from variable density negatives by the Model D Bell & Howell printer has been studied from the point of view of high-frequency response and uniformity of product. Differences in frequency response are noted between prints made in different commercial laboratories. Individual prints in the majority of cases show variations in unmodulated track density and in the amplitude of wave envelope at high frequencies. The former are due chiefly to irregularities in the film drive and possibly to some extent to variations inherent in film. — The effect of simple mechanical filtering by the addition of a flywheel is discussed. High-frequency wave envelope irregularities result from momentary loss of contact at the printing aperture. The influence of threading, gate adjustment, printing speed, air pressure, type of illumination, degree of shrinkage, and variations in aperture height are discussed. The changes in high-frequency response produced by modifications of mechanical parts do not cover the range of difference observed among commercial prints. A part of this difference in loss characteristic is likely to be found in the developing operation."
"The results of a study of the relation between sensitometric conditions and the harmonic content introduced in the photographic process are described. Sinusoidal wave-forms of very low initial harmonic content were recorded, varying the negative exposure, negative development time, and positive exposure so as to cover a range of negative densities, negative gammas, and print densities. Sets of such records were made at several levels of modulation and several frequencies from 100 to 4000 cycles per second. — The records were analyzed on a recording microdensitometer which automatically recorded the transmission of the sound track. These traces, after being enlarged to the appropriate size in order to determine the harmonic content, were analyzed with a harmonic analyzer. The results show that sensitometric conditions for good quality are much more critical at the higher frequencies and that in general the harmonic content does not increase at those frequencies."
"Some of the problems involved in developing a program of military and civilian training films are briefly described, in addition to the manner of using the films in peace-time and war-time training. The relation between the Signal Corps and the storage of historical film in the New Archives Building at Washington, D. C., is briefly referred to."
"This paper represents a continuation of work previously reported (J. Soc. Mot. Pict. Eng., XVIII, No. 2, February, 1932, p. 207) concerning distortion of the photographic image resulting from directional currents of developer generated by movement of the film in film processing machines. Simpler methods of breaking up the directional currents than those previously described have been examined. Characteristic curves from “directional pairs” of sensitometric strips, and “densograms” of uniform exposures have been used for purposes of comparison. — Application of developer in the form of fine jets impinging upon the emulsion surface at frequent intervals has been found largely to eliminate directional effects. Violent agitation of the body of developer in the developing bath by injection of air gave good results, but was inferior to the jet system. Propelling the film on edge in a tray type machine offered no advantage over the horizontal film position. It is shown that under conditions found to be good from the standpoint of directional effects, distortions due to “Eberhardt effect” are present."
"The manner in which quality controlling factors for reproduced sound can be derived from the photographic characteristics of variable density sound records is described. Density curves and transmission values serve to calculate and express in quantitative terms: loudness, volume range, noise, and distortion, for a given degree of electrical amplification. Normal and noiseless sound recording are discussed and described from the photographic point of view. The photographic process is described in sensitometric terms, and it is shown how the tolerances within which it has to be carried can be determined and controlled."
"The use of wide frequency-range equipment has forced the designer to consider many of the possible sources of distortion in order to determine limits for their effects. The work described in this paper was performed to ascertain the improvement provided by the new Bilateral sound track as well as to set allowable tolerances for commercial equipments. It is shown that the amount of distortion due to aperture alignment can be reduced readily to negligible amounts, particularly when the Bilateral Sound Track is used, since here both sides of the sound wave vary, thereby reducing the amplitude required for full modulation. The analysis has been limited to variable amplitude film and is restricted to a sine wave."
"The B & H “Morgana” process is an additive color process. Each successive picture frame is analytically photographed through a red and a blue-green filter alternately. The conventional color filter wheel has been replaced by an oscillating element that brings the proper filter into position between the lens and the film at each exposure. Regular panchromatic reversal film is used. The normal photographic speed is 24 picture frames per second though other speeds can be used. — During projection two successive frames move forward and one backward, or in reverse, in the following order: 1–2; 1–2–3; 2–3–4; 3–4–5; etc. The result is that, although the film is running at a linear speed of 24 frames (1 2/3 feet) per second, 72 frames are alternating at the aperture during the same length of time, each picture frame being projected three times on the screen. This accrued projection speed eliminates color flicker and greatly reduces color fringing. A conventional filter wheel rotating before the projection lens at a speed of 2160 rpm. synthetically produces the impression of color during projection. Photographic filters are now available for panchromatic reversal 16-mm. film for daylight or tungsten filament incandescent bulbs, selected for proper analysis of color during the photographic process in accordance with the light radiation characteristics of the source of light used."
"A newly developed gas-electric generator, recently made available to the industry, is described. There are two types, the small units having a capacity of 40 kw. and the larger ones a capacity up to 160 kw. — The gas-electric generators described have unique features of voltage control, which is an essential requirement when generators are used in the field with incandescent lamps as a load. They have been designed to have minimum weights for their capacities and are more silent in operation than any units heretofore built."
"After reviewing briefly some of the difficulties of excluding noise from sound cameras, a silent camera, recently developed, is described in detail. This camera makes unnecessary the use of blimps and possesses all the features necessary and desirable in modern camera construction."
"A multiple sound head moviola, designed for lessening the time required to synchronize and check effects tracks, is described. It consists of one standard viewing machine and three sound reproducers coupled together by flexible shafts and clutches."
"The new Ciné-Kodak Special is briefly described, particularly in connection with its application to photographing surgical operations both in color and in black and white. In addition to the usual features of 16-mm. cameras, the advantages of being able to produce fades, dissolves, double exposures, multiple exposures, single-frame exposures and to use masks of various kinds, increase the facility with which the camera can be used for surgical instruction and records. The paper refers briefly to some of the work done at the University of Rochester with this camera."
"As chairman of the Committee on Photoplay Appreciation of the National Council of Teachers of English, the author describes experimentation undertaken by the Council during 1932 and 1933 for the purpose of determining whether the movie habits of adolescents can be improved significantly through the medium of the English classroom; and desirable ideals and attitudes can be developed through the medium of well-selected current photoplays; and whether the neighborhood theater can serve in part as an educational laboratory working in direct relation to the public school."
"The Non-Theatrical Equipment Committee is one of the newest committees of the Society, having been formed a little more than a year ago. Its function and purpose are to investigate all matters relating to 8- and 16-mm. film cameras and projectors, 35-mm. film portable and semi-portable projectors, stereopticon and film slide projectors, and accessories such as screens, film splicers, reels, etc. It is the function of the Committee also to investigate proposals of standardization for submittal to the Committee on Standards and Nomenclature on matters that can be more advantageously studied by this Committee because of its close contact with the non-theatrical field."
"It is well known that the properties of developers change during use as a result of depletion of the developing agents and accumulation of reaction products. This change is greatest for low-energy developers such as those of the borax type, and results in (1) a reduced development rate, and (2) a lowering of effective emulsion speed. These two effects may be offset to some extent by increasing the development time and by adding booster solutions to revive the developer. Another method of securing a more uniform degree of development throughout the life of a developer consists in using two developer baths in succession. — Three types of two-bath developers have been investigated, as follows: (1) bath A contained all the developing agents plus sodium sulfite; bath B, all the alkali plus the balance of the sulfite. (2) Both baths contained developing agents. (3) Both baths were of identical composition, the first bath being replaced by the second as it became exhausted. The results of the investigation showed that Type I is the most satisfactory developer combination and with this method it is possible to obtain an almost constant gamma with only a slight loss of emulsion speed over a fairly wide range of time of development. A formula is also suggested for the development of variable density sound negatives. The application of two-bath developers to machine, and rack and tank systems is described."
"It is the purpose of this paper to present a résumé of the current methods involved in the application of sensitometry to motion picture film processing today in the major laboratories in Hollywood, Calif. During the past decade very rapid progress has been made in the general technic of handling motion picture film of all kinds in a variety of processes. This paper, however, discusses only that phase of the handling that deals with the actual chemical development processes."
"The following report, reviewing the conditions as actually found at present in the field, is intended as an introduction to a more detailed and technical study of laboratory practice, to be reported on later. All the phases of handling and treating both unexposed and exposed film in laboratories are discussed, beginning with the testing of the raw stock as received by the laboratory, passing through the exposing, developing, fixing, washing, and drying of the film and concluding with duplicating and several subsidiary operations. Following the initial work of the sub-committee represented by the studies of existing conditions described in this report, the subcommittee purposes in the future to report separately on each of the above phases."
"The following report, reviewing the conditions as actually found at present in the field, is intended as an introduction to a more detailed and technical study of exchange practice to be reported on later. All the phases of handling film in the exchanges are discussed, beginning with the reception of the release print from the laboratories, passing through treating and processing, maintenance and inspection, and including a discussion of the equipment and control of the exchanges. Following the initial work of the sub-committee, represented by studies of the existing conditions described in this report, the sub-committee purposes in future reports to deal separately and at great length with each of these phases individually."
"The evolution of the modern high fidelity recorder, from the relatively crude apparatus first used for recording when sound was added to the picture, is traced; beginning with the telegraphic recording device known as the pallophoto-phone developed by C.A. Hoxie, passing through the phonofilm devised by L. de Forest, and continuing through the RCA PR-1 and PR-3 to the up-to-date PR-4 variable width recorder embodying the latest developments for maintaining a high constancy of speed and for producing recordings of the highest quality. The paper describes the new model recorder and film phonograph, and the application of these to dubbing and re-recording, both on 35-mm. and 16-mm. film."
"After briefly referring to the effect of the scattering of light upon measurements of density, according to the way in which density is measured, the author alludes to various attempts made in the past to find a quantitative relation between the specular density and the diffuse density of a medium. A special projection densitometer was designed for measuring the specular density, and a form of integrating densitometer for the diffuse density, of a number of samples of negative and positive motion picture film. The results indicate an exponential relation between the two kinds of density, the time of development and the variation of gamma, within the range of the measurements, being negligible."
"The paper describes methods of using sheet film base in making models for experimental processes. Methods of cutting and scraping the material are described at length, as also the manner of making and using the requisite thick and thin cements employed in making welds. Various illustrations are given in order to exemplify the processes."
"The motion picture as it is known today has existed less than fifty years but certain of the principles which underlie its development can be traced back many years more. This paper represents an attempt to list chronologically the chief devices and inventions pre-dating the motion picture equipment of 1895."
"The following chronology deals with the evolution of motion pictures as produced photographically on a nitrocellulose support carrying a light-sensitive emulsion of one kind or another. Even though the later dates of the preceding chronology overlap the earlier dates of the one that follows, the two chronologies have been kept distinct in order to present the history of the nitrocellulose film base as a unit in itself."
"The author, who presided over the meeting of the Photographic Convention of the United Kingdom at Chester, England, in 1890, describes some of the work of E. J. Marey, Muybridge, Friese-Greene, and Le Prince, pioneers in the art of producing and exhibiting motion pictures. The information given in this paper is particularly interesting in view of the personal acquaintance of the author with these pioneers during the time in which they were conducting their work."
"This report of the Progress Committee covers the period June, 1932, to May, 1933. The advances in the cinematographic art are classified as follows: (I) Cinematography, (II) Sound Recording, (III) Sound and Picture Reproduction, (IV) Film Laboratory Practice, (V) Applications of Motion Pictures, (VI) Publications and New Books, (VII) Appendix."
"The Sound Committee has compiled in this report an outline of the major problems relating to sound recording and reproducing that require solution. Coördinated summaries of this sort, which necessitate first a broad and unbiased survey, may prove of value by emphasizing the limiting factors in the several branches of the industry whose inter-relationship is too often overlooked."
"In order that the Standards Committee might be representative of the entire industry, an effort has been made to include in its personnel members connected with all the various branches of motion picture engineering, in order that the points of view in matters of standardization of all these branches be brought before the Committee; and to make the scope of the work of standardization as broad as possible, a number of the members of the Committee are chairmen of other committees of the S. M. P. E., which committees, dealing with specific subjects, are in a position to propose standards for consideration by the Standards Committee. In order to indicate the representative nature of the membership of the Standards Committee, therefore, there is appended to this report a list of the members, together with their commercial affiliations. In the few cases that infrequently arise in which an interest particularly concerned with the projects at hand is not represented on the Committee, an effort is always made to obtain the points of view of those interests on the subjects under consideration, either by correspondence or by inviting their representatives to attend meetings of the Committee as guests."
"Since its last report, the Projection Screens Committee has engaged in studies of several matters pertaining to screens and projection practices, the most important of which are: standardization of sizes of manufactured screens, a simple method of determining reflectivity of the screen in the theater, and sound transmission characteristics of screens in connection with the extension of the range of frequency of reproduced sound. These, with other matters of interest, are discussed in the following sections."
"Owing to the wide dispersion of the members of the Studio Lighting Committee the report of the Committee has this year been compiled from information obtained from the various manufacturers of equipment regarding developments in light sources, and the heads of electrical departments in the various studios as regards current practice and operation."
"Under the present organization of the Society, there are three projection committees : namely, the Projection Screens Committee, the Projection Practice Committee, and the Projection Theory Committee. Since it is the primary function of the Projection Theory Committee to deal with the optical principles involved in the projection of motion pictures, the work of this Committee does not lend itself to the usual type of progress report. The optical principles have long been established—so long, in fact, that they are seldom discussed in the current literature. Instead, one must look for them in advanced works on optics, which ordinarily contain so much irrelevant material that a full understanding of the theory of optical projection is not easily acquired. The Projection Theory Committee feels that it can be of greatest service to the Society by preparing a short monograph on the theory of projection. This monograph will discuss the function of the light source, the condenser, and the projection lens; will analyze the requirements that must be met if these units are to work together effectively; and will indicate, by a discussion of the photometry of optical instruments, the method of obtaining the maximum illumination of the screen with a given source of light. As this report is written, the monograph is in outline form, and will undoubtedly be completed during the coming summer."
"This Committee was appointed for the purpose of collecting data and information pertaining to the preservation of all types of film such as might be produced by the motion picture industry; but, particularly, to collaborate with the supervising architects of the new Government Archives Building which is in course of construction under the direction of the Treasury Department of the United States."
"The work of this Committee in preserving the traditions and relies of the motion picture has gone steadily forward during the past year. A majority of the pioneers of the industry are represented by relies of their endeavors in this collection, which is being brought together under the sponsorship of the S. M. P. E."
"The advantages claimed for non-intermittent projectors are presented, followed by a list of questions that the writers think should be answered with regard to any projector of this type. The various projector types are then classified according to the optical means used to form a fixed image. Two types of error are noted and each type of projector listed is discussed, keeping these in mind. A reference table is appended to serve as a rapid review."
"This paper presents a brief description of the advantages of optical compression for producing wide screen pictures. There is included an exposition of the design and operating characteristics of cylindrical compression objectives, with particular reference to the high degree of central and marginal definition attainable. This latter is compared with the performance of existing motion picture lenses. In this connection there is presented a detailed quantitative description of the definition attainable with high-grade motion picture lenses. These data are correlated with information as to the physiological requirements for satisfactory definition on the screen."
"The characteristics of Infra D film, a stock designed specifically for specialized cinematography, possessing distinctive spectral sensitivity, are described. The sensitivity is limited to two regions at opposite ends of the spectrum, a relatively wide gap occurring between. Examples of the use of the film in producing special pictorial effects are given in the illustrations."
"Several precautions must be observed when variable density sound records are produced on 35-mm. lenticular film. An ammoniacal glycine solution is considered the most satisfactory developer. In order to secure the necessary individual control of the picture and sound records, it is suggested that the picture record be developed in a devoloper sufficiently charged with bromide, reversed, and then bleached, cleared, and dried. The sound record should then be exposed on the slightly sensitive emulsion remaining, and the entire film then developed, fixed, washed, and dried. — For better sound reproduction it is also suggested that the height of the embossed lines in the sound track area be less than that in the picture area."
"Fade-outs have been made for many years by moving the diaphragm or using a dissolving shutter in the camera during exposure. It is more convenient, however, to make a fade on either the developed positive or negative film by chemical means. — A modified Belitzski reducer formula of the “cutting” type is recommended for negative fade-outs. The film is introduced into a tube or tank filled with the solution with a positive acceleration so that the portion immersed last receives the least degree of reduction and a wedge effect is obtained. Another method consists in bleaching out the image in either a ferricyanide-bromide or a permanganate bleaching bath and redeveloping with the same manipulative treatment as for reduction. Positive fade-outs may be made conveniently by tinting with a black dye solution. — A mechanical device is described by means of which the necessary acceleration may be imparted to the film when immersing in the various solutions."
"The paper opens with a few remarks on the relation between the musician and the engineer, and refers particularly to certain inadequacies in the recording and reproduction of music. The improper acoustical construction of sets and the inappropriate placing of artists and accompanists are alluded to. The difficulty of satisfactorily recording background music is briefly discussed, and a suggestion is made for overcoming the masking of dialog by background music. Further remarks are made on the size of sets and various points of technic in recording and duping."
"At recent meetings of the photographic section of the Technicians Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and of the Chicago Section of the S. M. P. E., several pieces of new equipment were exhibited and discussed. The description of a few of the devices follows. Illustrations were supplied by Mr. J. G. Frayne, Chairman of the S. M. P. E. Progress Committee and Mr. C. E. Phillimore of the S. M. P. E. Chicago Section."
"Previous work has shown that fatigue of the visual process as a whole is not directly measurable; it is therefore necessary to adopt the alternative method of studying the individual processes involved in vision. An analysis of the studies so far made on these unit functions shows that the motor processes involved are not readily fatigued; ineffective activity of these processes, however, rapidly leads to sensations of fatigue. This activity results from inadequate sensory projection, whether the inadequacy is a result of difficult external seeing conditions or of decreased efficiency of the retinal processes. Experiments were performed which showed that: (1) the effective intensity of a given stimulus was affected considerably by the previous activity of the retina; (2) contrasts, and especially flicker, produced a marked retinal fatigue; (3) the site of this fatigue lay in the retinal structures behind the sense endings rather than in the sense endings themselves. It is concluded that retinal fatigue contributes a larger factor to visual fatigue than has hitherto been supposed; as long as the visual task is such that the factors producing a decrease in retinal efficiency are minimal, as is not usually the case in viewing the motion picture, visual fatigue will not supervene with unusual rapidity."
"The author discusses various defects in the production and projection of motion pictures, upon which the occurrence of ocular fatigue is assumed to depend. Remedies for these defects are suggested and the effect upon the patronage of a theater by the failure to apply the remedies is noted."
"An illustrated description is given of new sound recording equipment having an extended frequency range1 and capable of making recordings and re-recordings on either 35-or 16-mm. film. Contact prints made from the 35-mm. recordings or re-recordings, when played on a reproducing equipment having a flat response characteristic, produce sound outputs that do not vary more than plus or minus two decibels over the frequency range 50 to 9000 cycles. The equipment is composed of units that are light in weight, are small and compact but rugged, consume little power and are easily installed and operated for either studio or portable use. — Some of the features of the equipment are (a) symmetrical variable width recording with improved ground noise reduction; (b) a new large mirror galvanometer; (c) permanent magnet ribbon microphones operated remotely from their amplifiers; (d) improved constant impedance mixer using variable bridged “T” type attenuators; (e) correction for the response of the human ear to speech reproduced at greater than normal volume; (f) new amplifying equipment providing improved quality and quieter operation; and (g) new high-quality film phonograph and recorders."
"The problems involved in the transmission of motion pictures by television are, in general, less difficult to solve in certain respects than the problems in the television transmission of living subjects or objects in studios and, above all, out of doors. In the following article, a description is given of an interesting invention that changes the problems of television out of doors into corresponding problems of motion pictures by television."
"This paper describes a new photographic exposure meter, which measures the brightness of the scene to be photographed. It utilizes for its light measuring element two Weston photronic photoelectric cells connected in parallel to, and mounted in the same case with, a permanent magnet movable coil indicating instrument calibrated in units of brightness: candles per sq. ft. The cells are of the direct action dry disk type, which transform light energy directly into electrical energy, requiring no battery, and having an unlimited life. They are mounted in tubular depressions to limit the area of the scene covered. — A simple mechanical dial calculator attached to the meter case translates light values into exposure values by a single setting of a dial, after having set the calculator once for all for the speed of the film being used. The calculator has the novel feature of providing means for fitting the brightness range of a scene as determined by its darkest and brightest objects, to the correct film range indicated on the dial as lying between the darkest and brightest objects which the film will correctly expose, for the indicated shutter speed and aperture."
"The author proposes that, on account of the variation in the time between beats in music, more effective rendition of music could be accomplished by varying the time of reverberation of the auditorium or room in which the music is played. The relation between the tempo of the music and the time of reverberation is discussed, with particular reference to the overlapping of the reverberation from one bar of music to the succeeding bar. (Editor's note: The reader is cautioned to distinguish between the technical meanings of terms used in the paper and their meanings in musical parlance; the footnotes should be consulted for the musical acceptations.)"
"A description is presented of a complete new Western Electric double film portable recording system recently perfected by Electrical Research Products, Inc. The equipment is mounted in a trunk and is designed to be used for location, industrial, and educational recording where portability is of the utmost importance. Entirely new designs of the system amplifier, noise reduction unit, d-c. interlocking motor system, double film recorder, and other units have been perfected. The improved moving coil microphone, permanent magnet light valve, and many other recent equipment developments have been used. The minimum weight of the simplest sound recording channel of this new type is approximately 325 pounds. By adding other units, sound recording systems of any degree of elaborateness may be established."
"The following material dealing with the principles relating to the control of the effectiveness of graphical presentation of engineering data is abstracted from the American Recommended Practice on the subject which was approved by the American Standards Association on Nov. 11, 1932 (ASA Z15.1—1932). The standard prepared by a sub-group of the sub-committee on Engineering and Scientific Graphs of the Sectional Committee on Graphical Presentation, under the procedure of the American Standards Association, 29 W. 39th St., New York, N. Y. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers took the official leadership in the development of this project. The original draft was presented before the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in December, 1931."
"The author traces in this paper the development of composite photographic processes, in terms of the patent history of the art, from its beginning to April 1, 1932. For convenience, the art is divided into three phases, namely: the mask process, the projection process, and the color-separation process. Each of these lines has evolved into several variants, the development of which is traced through the patent literature."
"The physical and photographic properties of the lenticular screen process of producing motion pictures in color, as developed by Berthon, and later known under the name Keller-Dorian and commercialized in the 16-mm. field under the name Kodacolor, are briefly described. The author traces the development of the process from the earlier mosaic screen process, and after giving consideration to the technical problems involved, indicates that the situation obtaining at present may be regarded as one stage of a development leading up to the application of the lenticular screen process to the 35-mm. field as well as the 16-mm. field."
"This paper describes the general procedure employed in producing animated cartoons, particularly the technic employed by the Walt Disney Studios. The qualities required in the animators, and the problems that these animators must solve in realizing the dramatic situations and synchronizing them with the music and sound effects are discussed. An example of the procedure followed in producing the cartoon is given, including illustrations of the layout sheet, exposure sheet, and camera field charts."
"A method of measuring axial chromatic aberration is described in which an image of a line grating test object illuminated by a monochromator is formed by the lens under test. The image thus formed is projected onto a steeply inclined photographic plate by means of a highly corrected microscope objective. Individual exposures are made at selected wavelengths and a curve showing the change of image, position as a function of wavelength for the lens under test is readily derived from measurement of the developed plate. Data are given showing the order of agreement attained between computed values of axial chromatic aberration and values obtained by this method."
"In timing races by the usual method employing a manually operated stop-watch, errors are liable to arise independently of the accuracy of the timepiece. In order to eliminate this cause of error, a system of timing races has been devised employing a motion picture camera, with which are photographed a very accurately adjusted chronometer at both the beginning and the end of the race, and the contestants themselves at the finish line. This system has been applied successfully at recent important athletic meets held in the U. S.; particularly at the Xth Olympiad held at Los Angeles in 1932."
"Holding temperature, developing time, and agitation constant, the following relations exist: (1) In an elon-borax-sulfite developer, sulfite held constant and borax varied with the elon, γ = K log E + C, where E = elon conc. and K and C = constants: (2) In an elon-hydroquinone-borax-sulfite developer, hydroquinone and sulfite held constant and borax varied with the elon, γ = K log E + C, where E = elon conc. and K and C = constants: (3) In an elon-hydroquinone-borax-sulfite developer, elon, borax, and sulfite held constant, γ = K log H + C, where H = hydroquinone conc. and K and C = constants: (4) In an elon-hydroquinone-borax-sulfite developer, sulfite held constant and borax varied with the elon, γ = K1 log E + K2(log E)(log H) + K3 log H + K4, where E = elon conc., H = hydroquinone conc., and K1, K2, K3, K4 = constants: (5) In an elon-hydroquinone-borax-sulfite developer, γ and sulfite held constant, and borax varied with the elon, there exist optimum concentrations of elon and hydroquinone for maximum economy."
"Projection provides the industry's closest contact with the public, whose continued patronage is dependent largely upon the quality of the projected picture and the reproduced sound—the finished product which embodies the work of all other branches of the industry. Acceptance of the foregoing fact leads naturally to a consideration of the means available for maintaining at all times a high standard of quality. The Committee feels that every facility that aids, even remotely, in maintaining a high standard of projection should willingly be provided."
"An experimental demonstration apparatus is described for projecting motion pictures in relief by application of the principle of the parallax panoramagram. A series of thirty-two posed, still pictures is made by the use of a large diameter concave mirror forming an image on a transparent concave ridged screen, which in turn is imaged on lantern-slide plates. Positives from these negatives are mounted on a slowly rotating disk in the slide plane of a projection lantern. A flashing mercury lamp illuminates each picture as it comes into position. The projected image is received upon the back of a translucent convex ridged screen. When viewed from the front, the moving picture changes its appearance with the observing position, and exhibits stereoscopic relief."
"A new type of arc operated on alternating current is a desirable substitute for the low-intensity, direct-current arc used in the majority of motion picture theaters. This arc is a modification of the well-known white-flame arc, in which the light sources are concentrated at the electrodes by using heavy currents and low arc voltages on specially designed carbons. — It is operated at current densities higher than those employed in direct-current arcs, and produces a screen light of a blue-white color similar to that obtained with the direct-current, high-intensity arc. The bluish white screen light is remarkably steady and uniform. The power required to produce a given screen illumination is considerably less than that required with the low-intensity, direct-current arc."
"To increase the light output per watt, to improve the actinicity of the light, to increase the proportion of blue light badly needed for color photography, and to reduce the size and number and increase the output of the lighting units, tungsten lamp filaments are heated to temperatures as near the melting point as is practicable. Reference data are presented on lumen output, efficiency, color (energy) distribution, and lamp life. Practicable safe operating limits are indicated. A new “super photoflood” lamp is described and data on overvoltage lamp operation for location lighting are presented for reference."
"Most hardening fixing baths containing potassium alum tend to lose their hardening properties and precipitate a sludge of aluminum sulfite long before the fixing power of the sodium thiosulfate becomes exhausted. It is customary in large-scale practice to offset this loss in hardening properties by adding acid to the bath several times during its useful life. The addition of boric acid (5 grams per liter) to a fixing bath containing potassium alum has been found to increase the hardening life about four times and to minimize the sludging tendency to such an extent that revival with acid is unnecessary during the useful life of the bath. — A detailed study has been made of the properties of fixing baths containing potassium alum, acetic acid, sodium sulfite, and boric acid, and a suitable formula is recommended for motion picture work. Except for tropical use, it is considered that the formula containing boric acid is to be preferred to most chrome alum fixing baths which require frequent revival with acid during use'in order to maintain uniform hardening properties."
"The need of determining accurately the brightness of subjects to be photographed so as to enable the cinematographer to determine the optimum exposure of the film in motion picture cameras by instrumental means rather than by visual estimate, is discussed at some length; and the errors inherent in the visual methods are shown to be very considerable. — An exposure meter known as the Graphometer has been designed for the purpose of enabling the cinematographer to determine the proper exposure of the film; it operates on the photoelectric cell principle and may be used with a standard camera. A brief discussion of the method of using the Graphometer is included."
"This paper deals with the various problems involved in applying sound to 16-mm. film and points out the advantages of the particular type of film that was chosen. There are two general methods of producing 16-mm. positives, the direct and the indirect. The direct method involves the recording of sound directly on a 16-mm. negative, from which is printed a 16-mm. positive either by contact or by the reversal process. The indirect method concerns various ways of obtaining 16-mm. positives from 35-mm. film. The problems involved in printing and reproducing 16-mm. sound films are discussed."
"By operating the filaments of high-efficiency tungsten lamps at higher voltages than normal, not only are the operating characteristics of the lamps improved, but a more desirable spectral energy distribution for color photography is attained, the increase of the blue-violet radiation amounting to about 140 per cent of the increase of the red-orange radiation. In view of the fixed voltages used on sets, the lamps are, in effect, designed for lower voltage and wattage. Data on the candle-power distribution with suitable reflectors are presented."
