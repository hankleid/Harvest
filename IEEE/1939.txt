"The CBS Hollywood broadcast studios, which incorporate many new features and engineering developments, are described. The studio and master-control audio-frequency facilities are detailed and system designs presented. A number of constructional features, new to broadcast plant design, are outlined."
"The maximum uniform amplification that can be secured over a wide frequency band by means of a single vacuum tube is much greater than that of the usual simple circuits. It can be secured by either of two arrangements, one using an individual filter coupling each tube to the next, and the other using degenerative feedback in each stage to make the stage behave as a section of a confluent filter. In either case, the shunt capacitance on each side of each tube is included in an individual full-shunt arm of a band-pass or low-pass filter. One end of each interstage filter, or of each filter including one or more feedback stages, is extended to a dead-end termination with resistance approximately matching the image impedance. The other end is terminated at one of the tubes in a full-shunt arm, where the filter presents the maximum uniform impedance that can be built up across the tube capacitance. These concepts in terms of wave filters lead to practical wide-band circuits adapted to meet any given requirements. The following general formula is shown to express the maximum uniform amplification that can be secured in one tube: gm A= 7rfwVCgCp in which A is the voltage ratio between input and output circuits of equal impedance, gmis the transconductance of the tube, Cg, and Cp, are the grid and plate capacitance of the tube, and fwis the width of the frequencv band."
"A line microphone with useful directivity normal to the line axis is described. Several types of line microphones with useful directivity along the line axis are described as follows: A simple line, a line with progressive delay, two simple lines and a pressure-gradient element, two lines with progressive delay, and a pressure-gradient element. An ultra-directional microphone employing line elements exhibits uniform directional characteristics over the range from 85 to 8000 cycles."
"By the application of the principle of regeneration to certain modulation systems, a generator of submultiple or other fractional frequency ratio may be obtained. A simple example is obtained by considering a second-order modulator whose output is connected back to a conjugate input by means of a feedback loop including an amplifier and a selective network. If an inputfrequencyfo is applied, it is found that afrequency component f0/2 appearing in the feedback path will modulate with the applied frequency to produce sidebands of f0/2 and 3f0/2. The network and amplifier, being especially efficient for the frequency f0/2 and having a gain higher than the modulator loss, will reinforce this component causing it to build up to some steady-state value. Similar processes are possible by which greater submultiple ratios may be obtained. Since the output wave is obtained by a modulation process involving the input wave, it will appear only when an input is applied and then bears a fixed frequency ratio with respect to it. Experiments show that the ability of the generator to produce a fractional frequency is independent of phase shift in the feedback path. Circuits are possible in which the amplitude of the fractional-frequency wave will bear a linear relation to the input wave over a reasonable range and at the same time maintain a constant phase angle between the two waves. Typical circuits are discussed which make use of copper oxide as the modulator elements."
"Given the phase and amplitude characteristics of a filter, a graphical method is presented for deriving the phase and amplitude characteristics of the modulation envelope or video-frequency response when a modulated carrier is impressed. Sources of distortion are briefly discussed. Several filter structures are considered as to their suitability for use in attenuating one side band of a television signal. Radio-frequency phase and amplitude characteristics are given, with notes as to the physical realizability of the structures. Resulting video-frequency phase and amplitude characteristics are derived after demodulation, and in some cases the video-frequency transient response resulting from a suddenly impressed carrier is given. Design formulas are given for a filter using transmission lines as circuit elements. Some problems in the application of a filter to the transmitter are considered. The gain of amplifier stages is treated for many types of video- and radio-frequency amplifiers, for single- and double-sideband use, and for one- and ten-stage amplifiers, when meeting certain tolerances to a fixed maximum modulation frequency."

"After the alternative systems of reception are outlined an account of the supersonic light control is given. Its advantages are explained and the optical principles employed for a full exploitation of these advantages are described."
"The practicalform taken by the apparatus is indicated by photographs and line drawings. The factors governing the choice of the cell liquid, the crystal frequency, and the lens powers are explained, and a brief description of the electrical apparatus, with circuit diagrams, is given. For the projection of large pictures in cinemas an arc lamp is used but otherwise the optical and electrical components require little modification."
"Data concerning the size and speed of the high- and low-speed scanners are followed by a description of the motors and the electrical equipment necessary to drive these. The maximum rate of change of frequency that can be followed by the high-speed scanner is mentioned and a method of testing the rate of change of frequency of the transmitter synchronizing pulses is described."
"The question of optical efficiency is discussed in relation to various forms of scanning. The \"split-focus\" principle and the smaller size of scanner thereby made possible are described with the aid of perspective drawings. Figures relating to the design of bar and slit sizes for the supersonic cell are given and the method of calculating the light flux on the screen is described. Tolerances on the accuracy of the scanners are discussed and the adjustment for the effect of temperature on the acoustic speed of the liquid is mentioned."
"To obtain data on the variation of field strength beyond the horizon, simultaneous recordings were made at three locations, one within the optical path of the transmitter, one 700 feet below the line of sight, and one 11,400 feet below the line of sight. All three locations were on the same linefrom the transmitter. Recordings extended over a two-week period, chosen at a time when atmospheric refraction was likely to be favorable. Analysis of the recorded data indicates several things of interest. The variation of field strength at each location was random and showed no correlation with any other location; the range of field-strength variation exceeded 49 decibels at the most remote location; maximum fields generally occurred at night; and previous data on the rate of attenuation beyond the horizon were confirmed."
"This paper describes a new high-efficiency modulating system in which carrier is supplied by a single tube acting as a class C amplifier. This tube drives the load through an impedance-inverting network and becomes, in effect, a constant-current generator. A second tube, working directly into the load, is operated as a class B amplifier, and is excited with a signal consisting of both side bands with carrier suppressed. For upward modulation, the second tube has an output in phase, at the load, with the first and delivers additional current to the load. For downward modulation, the second tube has an output in phase opposition, at the load, to that of the first and absorbs current which would otherwise be delivered to the load. The use of biases to improve further the efficiency and to reduce distortion and the use of envelope feedback to reduce distortion are described."
"One of the problems in the art of reproducing a scene by television is to obtain an image with adequate contrast. Although a relatively low contrast range may suffice for the transmission of intelligence, a much greater contrast range is essential for the reproduction of clear, lifelike images. The factors harmful to contrast in the kinescope are well known and may be studied in a variety of ways. In the belief that the reaction of the observer is the ultimate criterion for judging the perfection of the image, the author began the present investigation with a series of viewing tests designed to determine the relative psychological effects of the various factors harmful to contrast. On the basis of these tests, it was definitely concluded that halation is far more detrimental to image quality than screen curvature or bulb-wall reflections. Experimental evaluation of the relative importance of the individual factors harmful to contrast leads to the same conclusion, and it is evident that a considerable improvement in contrast could be effected by reducing halation. A detailed analytical study of halation shows how it depends upon various parameters. Particularly significant is the conclusion that halation may be reduced several fold by introducing a small amount of light-absorbing material in the kinescope face. According to this analysis, a 10 to 20 per cent absorption should give a three-to sixfold reduction in halation. Developmental kinescopes made in accordance with these principles give greatly improved contrast."

"Radio station WHAS purchased the first commercial transmitter employing the Doherty high-efficiency amplifier and has installed it in a completely new transmitting plant which is designed for expansion to 500 kilowatts output. The transmitter extends the use of negative feedback for noise suppression and all vacuumtube filaments are heated with alternating current, completely eliminating rotating equipment except for fans and pumps. Heat for the building is obtained from the water-cooling system, in which porcelain tubes entirely replace rubber hose for the insulating sections. Six-inch concentric transmission line of refined design is used to convey energyfrom the transmitter to the antenna and for the suppression of harmonics. The novel construction of the feed line to the shunt-excited half-wave antenna makes unnecessary the coupling apparatus ordinarily used between the transmission line and the inclined lead to provide the capacitive reactance required at that point in the circuit. The theory and practice followed in the design of the high-efficiency amplifier and other special features are touched upon as the entire plant is described. Performance data of the transmitter and the antenna system are also included."
"The sensitivity and picture-signal output of iconoscopes have recently been increased by a factor of two or three times. The spectral response of the newer tubes more dosely resembles that of the eye and may be controlled by processing. \"Dark spot\" has been diminished by the use of a cylindrical envelope. The gun design has been changed to give a constant current as the beam is focused, and to prevent secondary electrons from the gun apertures getting into the primary beam. Use of the cylindrical envelope gives a better picture since a good optical window can be employed. Sandblasting of the mosaic improrves the picture contrast and quality by minimizing the specular reflection of the mosaic. More precise methods of measuring signal output, \"dark spot,\" photoemission, and secondary emission of the mosaic, spectral response, and resolution are described."
"An iconoscope having increased sensitivity is to be desired for purposes of improving studio conditions, making possible more universal outdoor work, and permitting greater depths of focus. The new tube described obtains its high sensitivity by making use of an electron image of the scene to be transmitted, projected onto a scanned mosaic. The method permits more efficient and better photocathodes, and also secondary-emission image intensification at the mosaic, resulting in a sensitivity 6 to 10 times greater than that of the standard iconoscope operated under the same conditions. The translucent photocathode is made by evaporating silver on a transparent surface, oxidizing, treating with caesium, and evaporating more silver. The electron image may be focused by either electrostatic or magnetic fields. Several types of mosaics are suitable for receiving and storing the electron picture."
"Television pickup tubes which use a low-velocity electron beam for scanning a photosensitive target offer the possibility of avoiding some of the limitations of devices which use a high-velocity beam. Some of the advantages of the low-velocity beam are: (1) low level of spurious signals, (2) high maximum signal output, and (3) high efficiency of conversion of light into signal. The major problems encountered are: (1) ways to keep the beam in focus and (2) ways to obtain undistorted scanning of the photosensitive target. One solution to the difficulties of low-velocity-beam scanning involves the use of a uniform axial magnetic field to guide and focus the beam near the target. Because of this magneticfield, the usual type of deflection plates or deflection coils cannot be used to advantage. Two types of scanning which may be used are: (1) the release by a flying light spot of a beam of photoelectrons from successive points on a photocathode already immersed in the magnetic field and (2) the displacement of a beam from a thermionic cathode by a pair of defiection plates or coils operating in conjunction with the axial magnetic field and having an aperture at least as wide as the target to be scanned. Developmental television pickup tubes using each of these types of scanning with low-velocity electrons were tested and found to give the low spurious signal, high signal output, and high efficiency which had been expected."
"A description is given of a phase-shifting device which can be used with a beat-frequency oscillator and a cathode-ray oscilloscope to determine quickly the essential points on the frequency-response curve of an audio-frequency amplifier. Use is made of the fact that the phase shift through a single-stage amplifier is ±135 degrees when the gain has dropped to 70.7 per cent of the mid-frequency value, if the amplifier coupling circuit has no resonances. By properly introducing a 45-degree phase shift into the cathode-ray oscilloscope circuit from a network equivalent to an ideal cable a straight-line Lissajous figure is obtained at the 70.7 per cent relative-gain frequencies. The method is extended to include the determination of other significant frequencies in the commonest types of single- and multiple-stage audio-frequency amplifiers."
"This paper describes the design of improved types of electron multipliers in which the electrodes are so shaped and positioned as to provide accurate electrostatic focusing and to minimize space-charge limitations. The first section of the paper describes the general methods available for determining electron trajectories in electrostaticfields. The second section describes the details of design of several experimental self-focusing electron-multiplier tubes."
"A knowledge of the radio-frequency voltages on the insulation of broadcast tower antennas is important to the design engineer, since a too-large factor of safety may add unduly to the tower cost. Attention is first given to the base-insulator voltage. The magnitude of this voltage is also of interest in the design of lighting chokes and coupling equipment. Theoretical values are derived and shown in curveform as a function of antenna height. The theoretical curves are supplemented by experimental data taken on self-supporting tapered towers, guyed cantilever towers, guyed uniform-cross-section towers, and guyed tubular steel masts. A theoretical treatment is then given concerning the role of guy wires from an electrical standpoint. Consideration is given to the currents in the guys, and the voltages on the guy insulators. Measurements are presented of the voltages existing on the guy insulators of two guyed masts of different constructions. These voltages are found to be so small that there seems little need for elaborate insulation except for the presence of high static or induced lightning voltages. The paper is concluded by some considerations of ways of providing protection against these high instantaneous and random voltages without the use of expensive and elaborate insulation."
"The maximum absolute impedance for a tuned circuit which consists of a low-loss radio-frequency transmission line, either short-circuited or open-circuited at its distant end, and shunted at its sending end by a capacitor of negligible resistance is shown theoretically to occur when the line length is practically an integral number of quarter wavelengths and the capacitance is zero. This conclusion disagrees with previous theoretical results, which indicated shorter optimum lengths. It is pointed out that the earlier results are incorrect because of the neglect of the quadrature component of the characteristic impedance. An experimental verification of the theoretical results is provided."
"A method is given for computing the instantaneous current induced in neighboring conductors by a given specified motion of electrons. The method is based on the repeated use of a simple equation giving the current due to a single electron's movement and is believed to be simpler than methods previously described."
"The effects of space charge in long, magnetically focused electron beams directed parallel to positively charged sheath electrodes are determined from a simple analysis. The main effects of space charge are: (a) to introduce departure from the potential distribution of the electrostatic case; (b) to set an upper limit for the beam current; and (c) to introduce instabilities and hysteresis phenomena in the behavior of the tube. It is shown that in a long beam the longitudinal potential gradient is negligible throughout the major portion of the beam length so that the upper limit for beam current is independent of beam length and of potentials of end electrodes, but depends only upon the relative transverse dimensions of the beam and of the surrounding sheath electrode and upon the sheath-electrode potential. The analysis gives expressions for maximum beam current, for space-potential distribution and for the minimum value of the focusing magnetic field, in terms of the beam and sheath-electrode dimensions and the sheath-electrode potential. The use of multicellular sheath electrodes to minimize the effects of space charge is discussed. Thin \"sheet\" beams and \"thin-walled\" tubular beams are treated separately by a simplified \"capacitance\" method and expressions for maximum current, space potential, and for minimum-focusing magnetic field are derived. The effect of space-charge interaction between multiple beams inside a common sheath electrode is considered and a method of control of current in one beam by the current in the adjacent beam is analyzed and also illustrated by experimental data."

"1. Current-limiting fuses have been developed and tested which will interrupt a short circuit well before the current reaches the maximum value it would attain were the fuse not present. 2. These fuses have many desirable characteristics such as high interrupting capacity, silent operation, no discharge of any kind during interruption, and practically no pressure generation. 3. Such fuses have an ideal application in the protection of small-capacity circuits connected to high-power buses because the associated devices in the circuit are not subjected to the heavy momentary short-circuit current which would exist were the fuse not present."
"This paper describes the procedure and practical results to date in applying single-phase motors to refrigeration compressors. The applications are primarily torque applications, temperature considerations being of secondary importance. A line of high-torque motors has been developed to meet the high starting and accelerating torques demanded by the compressors. Utilization of these torques results in running loads considerably higher than rated name-plate loads, without exceeding safe operating temperatures for the insulation life requirement. To meet these requirements a revised method of rating refrigeration motors on a starting and accelerating torque per horsepower and a starting efficiency basis is described. This method more clearly specifies a motor so that a more satisfactory application would be obtainable both from the standpoint of the user and the public utility company or code authority."
"The types of resistance-welding applications requiring precision control heretofore characterized by electronic equipment are well-known. Attempts to extend the field of application to borderline operations have not met with complete success because of the initial expense and complicated nature of the control available. A simplified form of precision control consisting of a synchronized magnetic contactor and motor-driven timer overcomes these objections without compromise on results obtained."
"Operating and test data concerning the maximum safe loading of impregnated-paper-insulated lead-covered cable are presented. The results of the study may be summarized as follows: 1. The occasional operation of cable at higher temperatures than are permitted by present temperature rules effects considerable economy. 2. During emergencies, temperatures of 5 to 35 degrees centigrade (depending on kind of cable) above those permitted by the rules are safe for the insulation. 3. For extra-high-voltage solid-type cable, void formation in insulation and expansion of lead sheaths may limit allowable temperatures and temperature ranges. 4. Cracking of lead sheaths due t reciprocating cable movement into manholes may limit the temperature range for usual daily loading. Limitation is more severe for longer conduit lengths up to 500 feet, but changes little with increase from 500- to 1,000-foot lengths. 5. Cracking of sheaths in manholes due to cable movement may be reduced by improving manhole conditions. 6. For many cables a balanced design requires a lead-alloy sheath that gives increased resistance to effects of cable movement and of internal pressures. 7. Continuous field temperature surveys are essential to efficient use of large conduit and cable systems. 8. Only a small fraction of the cable ever operates at the higher temperatures. 9. Data on center empty-duct temperatures and on average heat losses over 24-hour periods give satisfactory results in heat calculations. 10."
"As part of a program of im-provements made to the network analyzer in the electrical-engineering research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an instrument to measure watts and vars has been devised which imposes a negligible burden upon the network, is rapid in response, and has an error less than one-half per cent of full scale. The instrument consists of (1) a semistock electrodynamic wattmeter, (2) a negative-feedback vacuum-tube amplifier, and (3) a phase-shifting network. When the equipment is once assembled the presence of the amplifier may be ignored and the instrument used thereafter as any portable instrument. The principle of instruments of this kind has other important applications in the field of electrical measurements."
"Condenser bushings use paper to provide high dielectric and physical strength. The value of paper as an insulation is recognized by its accepted use as the insulating medium in cables, transformers, and other apparatus. It is also recognized that unlimited life is attained when proper protection is provided against external influences. Such protection is obtained by improved methods of winding the capacitors, treatment with oil impregnation, and surface varnish. Further protection is provided for outdoor bushings by sealing the condenser in a weather casing of porcelain with improved flexible caps and gaskets. Insulating oil or a plastic heavier than water is available for encasing the capacitor."
"The development of the type J 12-channel carrier telephone system for open-wire lines required an increase of nearly 5 to 1 in the transmission frequency range of the lines. In the provision of suitable line facilities a number of new problems were encountered with respect to attenuation, noise and cross talk. Methods for meeting these problems and the results obtained are described."
"Previous papers before the AIEE describe the development of a 12-channel type J carrier system. This paper discusses some of the practical problems encountered in extending the circuit capacity of existing open-wire lines by the use of this carrier system. The first systems of this type were placed in commercial operation lata in 1938. One of these systems is discussed in detail from the standpoint of obtaining satisfactory operation with the most economical arrangement of new and existing facilities."
"The extensive use of rectangular conductors for large alternating their electrical characteristics a problem of practical importance. Although these conductors are usually used in groups and in special configurations, no solution other than that of direct measurement has been given even for the basic problem of the distribution of current in a single isolated conductor. The mechanical complications of the direct measurement method are great, and the results obtained are necessarily an approximation. This paper presents a method by which the current density inside a rectangular section may be analytically determined if the surface current density, a comparatively easy quantity to determine, is known."
"1. A test cell suitable for use in bombardment studies on oils was developed. 2. Pure liquid paraffin, various cable oils, and ten hydrocarbons of known tupe molecular structure were studied, and it was found that a number of their characteristicsare changed by corona discharge. 3. The power factor of all samples increased with bombardment. 4. The one-minute d-c conductivity of bombarded samples was in most instances considerably lower than the a-c conductivity calculated from power-factor values. 5. Application of d-c potential to bombarded decalin for extended periods showed that the power factor and conductivity of the samples were thereby decreased considerably, the improvement being maintained only during and shortly after application of the potential. 6. The material responsible for the changes in power factor and conductivity, and produced during the bombardment, constitutes an extremely small portion of the bombarded oil. It consists of material which remains as residue during distillation of the bombarded oils at the temperatures and pressures used in these studies. 7. Currents resulting from application of identical a-c bombardment voltages to the cell were widley different for the various oils. 8. The gas evolution of the various oils under pombardment was widley different, generally more gas being obtained from the saturated than from the unsaturated compounds. 9. In practically all cases an increase in viscosity resulted from the bombardment of the oils."
"This paper is an extension of the work reported in a paper of the same title by the writer and C. N. Weygandt.1 The production of subharmonic oscillations in a series circuit consisting of a capacitor and an iron-cored inductor is studied by the method of matching boundary conditions. The calculations are carried out by means of a new mechanical calculating device, and are verified by differential-analyzer solutions. A sufficient, but not necessary, criterion for stability is deduced. Some consideration is given to the effect of resistance in the circuit."
"In a recent paper ``Similitude of Critical Conditions in Ferroresonant Circuits,''24 a generalized solution for the critical conditions of the series circuit was given. The same type of generalized treatment when applied to the parallel circuit yields a number of interesting conclusions to supplement those found for the series circuit."
"This paper deals with the fundamentals of resonant regulators for constant current, and compares them with other kinds of regulators. It also discusses the various forms such regulators may take, their applications and control, and protective equipment required for them. A simple method of predicting performance by means of the voltage diagram is developed."
"An automatic line voltage regulator is described which employs ferro-resonance and operates without tubes or moving parts of any kind. The device requires no maintenance attention nor expense, is highly efficient, very accurate, and much faster in its response than previous large-size line regulators."
"This paper discusses the fundamental requirements for stability in a generator voltage regulating system having several time delays. A new rheostatic type of voltage regulator element is described, together with a method of introducing antihunting means into the regulating system. In the appendices, a mathematical treatment gives the requirements for stability and adequate damping for several typical voltage regulating systems. It is shown that with certain systems, theoretically perfect regulation and also high damping are possible."
"The reflection prospecting method measures depths to subsurface strata by recording the travel time of re flected sound waves. The acoustic energy of the sound wave is converted into electrical energy by a pickup, amplified, filtered, and recorded. The equipment described pro vides automatic gain control in the amplifier, filtering to eliminate frequencies outside the reflection spectrum, and means of recording reflections from several points on the earth's surface, together with the necessary timing mechanism."
"This paper summarizes the results of an investigation of the harmonic currents and voltages in the a-c circuits of grid-controlled rectifiers and inverters. The principal part of the paper presents the development of a theoretical method for predetermining the magnitude of the harmonics in terms of the d-c load current, the commutating reactance, the rectifier transformer secondary voltage, and the amount of grid control. Harmonic voltages in the supply circuit may then be calculated from the harmonic currents and the supply-circuit reactances at the various harmonic frequencies. General curves are given to facilitate the calculation of the harmonic currents for the range of conditions usually encountered. In addition, curves are included for the easy determination of the product of the supply-circuit current and its own telephone influence factor, the I.T product, which quantity is useful in inductive co-ordination studies. Comparisons are given between the results of tests and the results of calculations by the theoretical method presented in this paper. These and other comparisons show very satisfactory checks so that the method may be considered to be established. The case of the inverter is treated in a manner similar to that used for the grid-controlled rectifier. The general curves for the rectifier may also be applied to the inverter by appropriate choice of the defining angles. The case of a-c circuits with nonlinear frequency-reactance characteristics is briefly considered, and an empirical modification of the theoretical method is suggested."

"It has been known for some time that an induction machine whose rotor is driven mechanically may become selfexcited if capacitors are connected across its terminals. The present paper is concerned with the predetermination of the machine characteristics when operating under such conditions. The frequency of excitation is very close to the synchronous frequeney corresponding to the speed of the rotor. The voltage to which the machine will excite is dependent upon its no- load excitation characteristics at that frequency, the criterion to be satisfied being that the lagging volt-amperes of excitation equal the leading volt-amperes of the capacitors. Under load, similar criteria must be satisfied. Voltage conditions are determined by a cut-and-try solution such that the summation of reactive volt-amperes equals zero. The slip is then obtained from the relation that the summation of the real power equals zero. These relations have been applied to various types of loads, such as pure resistance and inductive resistance, single-phase and three-phase and also to induction-motor load. Excellent checks between test and calculated results have been obtained."
"It is found that 60-cycle polarity characteristics correlate with the positive and negative impulse calibration curves for grounded sphere gaps sufficently well to use them for determining the polarity limits for sphere gaps. The available data show that the maximum spacing at which a grounded sphere gap has equal positive and negative spark-over is a linear function of the size of the spheres. From this relation, it follows that the maximum sparking distance for equal positive and negative spark-over, expressed as a per cent of the diameter of the spheres, is not constant for all sphere diameters. Therefore, arbitrary polarity limits expressed in terms of the diameter of the sphere cannot apply to all sizes of sphere gaps."
"This paper describes a family of devices which automatically respond to signals and control the circuit amplification in such a way as to improve transmission. Their general characteristics are outlined, their differences explained, and some of their applications are listed."
"From the foregoing discussion, it has been seen that the outstanding trends in the design and arrangement of electrical equipment in hydraulic power plants, with but a few exceptions, are toward greater simplification, reliability, and lower first cost. Inasmuch as fixed charges constitute the major portion of the cost of hydro power, a reduction in first cost affords the principal means for securing a reduction in the cost of water power."
"This paper describes an application of a new method of automatic control between two interconnected power systems, whereby greater utilization of the interconnection capacity is secured. As the stable limit of the interchange between systems is affected by variations in the magnitude and location of intermediate loads on the respective systems, direct control of the phase angle between systems recognizes such variations and permits a flexible and more stable type of operation including, when desired, maximum transfers of energy. An indication of the 60-cycle voltage from a desired point on one system is continuously transmitted by means of carrier current, to a point on the second system where its phase position is compared with that of 60-cycle voltage at the receiving point. The output of generating units at the control station is automatically regulated to maintain the phase angle between systems at desired values or within predetermined limits."
"Since the development of the copper-oxide rectifier in 1927, no paper has presented to the Institute a comprehensive list of the many problems to which the device may be applied successfully. It is the purpose of this paper to describe a few of the representative installations made in the various industries."
"This paper describes the power features of the aqueduct being built to supplement the water supply of Southern California. Three hundred thousand kilowatts of power ultimately will be transmitted from Boulder Dam to operate 45 synchronous motors driving centrifugal pumps. High efficiency, long life, and simplicity of design are given precedence over close voltage regulation and the elimination of momentary interruptions."
"A method of transmission and reproduction of line images is described which utilizes a cathode-ray tube for reproduction, the spot of which is made to trace out the line image 20 or more times a second. In an experimental test, a drawing of a woman's head was reproduced with an equivalent total band width of approximately 2,600 cycles. This was made up of two bands, each 1,300 cycles wide for the potentials to the two sets of cathode-ray deflector plates. Analysis of a more complex image, such as that of an animated cartoon shows that such material could be transmitted and reproduced by this method within a total band width of 10,000 cycles. Means are described for transcribing from drawing or animated cartoon film into recordings (similar to sound recordings) from which the potentials for transmission and subsequent operation of the cathode-ray tube may be obtained."
"The successful operating experience had during the first 1½ years with the Boulder Dam-Los Angeles transmission lines of the Department of Water and Power is reviewed in a symposium of five papers. Two unusually severe winter seasons and two lightning seasons, one of which was largely during the construction period, have served to test the line, so that an accurate judgment of its future performance can be made. An historical summary of the use of the line during permanent installation and adjustment of auxiliary equipment and through the period of normal operation to the present time is presented. The manner in which the electrical and mechanical performance has proved the design in developed and the unforeseen problems requiring solution are described. In addition to this general discussion, the excellent performance of the conductor from the standpoint of corona, the outstanding freedom from lightning flashover, are shown in two separate papers. Two additional papers describe the carrier-current supervisory and communication systems and the relay protection system as well as fully discussing the experience had in placing this equipment in adjustment and having successful operation."
"This paper covers a résumé of the fundamental principles of insulation and lightning design for the Boulder Dam transmission line, including the fog problems encountered in the coastal regions and the lightning problems of the desert section. The operation in both areas is covered, with particular reference to the lightning encountered during two years of construction and one year of operation. A description of the lightning recording equipment with current values and frequency of strokes is reported. From these values the adequacy of the design is definitely indicated."
"Experimental data show that the strength of compressed air as an insulator increases with pressure until a critical value is exceeded. At higher pressures the sparking voltage fails to rise, and may even drop. The maximum voltage and the critical pressure are largely dependent on the shape of the electrodes of the spark gap."
"The majority of water-wheel generators now in service have been built without damper windings. Recent technical investigations and laboratory tests have indicated that, in addition to reducing oscillations and improving system stability, damper windings are very effective for reducing high-peak voltages during unbalanced short circuits. This applies particularly under switching conditions of clearing a fault when the load is disconnected from the distant end of a transmission line, and the charging current results in capacitive loading of the unfaulted phases. The existence of similar overvoltage conditions was recognized by the Wilson Dam operating staff and later confirmed by oscillograms during tests. This paper summarizes the studies and tests based on the observed overvoltage conditions and describes a method for adding damper windings to large water-wheel generators which are already installed. Short-circuit tests are extended to generators on a large scale which confirm the earlier theoretical and laboratory tests and demonstrate the advantages to be gained by adding damper windings to other water-wheel generators now in service. The tests show that damper windings in one generator when operated in parallel with another generator without dampers are effective in reducing high-peak voltages during unbalanced faults. Data are given to show the changes in machine reactances due to adding damper windings."
"Secondary capacitors cost more than primary capacitors but they offer some additional benefits which may offset the additional costs. There are presented herein the results of a comprehensive economic study covering a wide variety of circuit and load conditions on both network and radial distribution systems to establish within reasonable limits the probable field of application of the secondary capacitor. From the results of the study it appears that secondary capacitors can be justified in practically all cases on secondary networks but have a limited application on primary radial distribution systems."
"Copper-oxide modulators are widely used in telephone systems for translating either single speech channels or groups of speech channels to carrier-frequency locations on the lines. A number of simple circuit arrangements have been developed that enable suppression of certain undesired frequencies to a degree that is impractical in tube modulators. These modulators transmit equally well in either direction and the modulating elements are more nonlinear than in tube modulators. As a result numerous effects are found that ordinarily are not important in the tube arrangements. Analytical studies have been considerably simplified by the use of a small signal, and a large carrier controlling the impedance variation of the copper oxide. It is found in this case that the superposition and reciprocity theorems hold for all the circuits that it has been possible to analyze even though the modulator is made up of nonlinear elements. Open and short-circuit impedance measurements can be made use of as in four-terminal linear networks, and a generalized reflection theory developed. Performance data are given for an idealized modulator under a variety of operating conditions."
"When the railroads began air conditioning their trains, adequate charging of the storage batteries associated with air-conditioning systems became an important factor in the new development. The capacity of the axle driven d-c generator charger was increased; however, supplementary charging was frequently necessary or desirable, particularly when the axle generators were not operating. The railroads met this problem by using portable motor generator sets, wiring their stations and yards with standby service and through the use of small, compact, dry-disk rectifier battery chargers of sufficient current capacities to charge one or two car batteries simultaneously. The first rectifier developed for this service made use of the magnesium-copper sulphide dry-disk type. The mechanism of this rectifier is here briefly discussed, design features enumerated, and the type of rectifier battery chargers developed for railroad use described."
"In summing up the characteristics of fiber glass those which make it valuable for electrical insulation are: 1. Noninflammable and highly heat resistant. The operable temperature is limited only by the impregnant used, and there is a very definite temperature range between the operable temperature of organic fabrics and that of heat-resistant impregnants where glass is unique. 2. Exceptionally high tensile strength. 3. Nonhygroscopic. 4. Resists attack by moisture, acids, oils, and corrosive vapors. 5. Good thermal conductivity. 6. Excellent dielectric strength when impregnated. 7. High insulation resistance."
"This paper describes the wave-shape characteristics of the sodium-vapor lamp and discusses the relative inductive influence of various series circuit arrangements in which such lamps are employed. A method is outlined by means of which the noise to be expected in an exposed telephone line may be estimated. Measures are described which may be applied in the telephone plant or in the lighting circuit to assist in the inductive co-ordination of the two systems. These measures need be considered only when a considerable number of lamps is involved, since noise induction is negligible when there are only a few lamps as, for instance, at highway intersections."
"The principles of designing electromagnetic horn ``antennas'' to obtain beams of specified angular spread, smoothness of contour and power gain are disclosed. Quantitative curves are given from which the design of sectoral and pyramidal horns may be readily made."
"Three types of gas-filled control tubes are now in common use. The properties of cold-cathode tubes, the most recent of these to receive extensive application, have been considered and comparisons drawn with those of the more familiar thyratron and ignitron. It is concluded that in its own field of low-current control devices the cold-cathode tube has several inherent advantages which will ensure a wide use for it in the future. These advantages are, the ability to operate without cathode heating power, the ability to start immediately when a signal is applied, and the absence of deterioration in standby service. A number of typical circuits illustrating the capabilities of the tubes as circuit elements have been described. Several of these are in commercial applications. One, involving some hundreds of thousands of tubes, has been operating for several years and proves beyond doubt that the cold-cathode tube is a valuable addition to the array of control devices available to the circuit engineer."
"A new carrier telephone system is described, together with its application in the long-distance telephone plant. By its use, an open-wire pair which already furnishes one voice circuit and three carrier circuits may have 12 more telephone circuits added. Thus in all 16 telephone circuits are obtained on a single pair. Several such systems may be operated on a pole line. Various problems incident to the extension of the frequency range, from about 30 kilocycles, the highest frequency previously used, to above 140 kilocycles, are discussed. Among the more important of these are the control of crosstalk between several systems on a pole line, arrangements for taking care of intermediate and terminal cables, and automatic means for compensating for the effects of weather variations on the transmission over this wide frequency range."
"This paper summarized the results of an investigation of transient voltages on power systems caused by switching and faults. The tranisent voltages on power systems an measured by the ''klydonograph'' are reviewed and compared with the flash-over values of transimission-line insulation. It is shown that the higher values of transient voltages are produced by intermittent arcs. In part I, the various theories for the production of transient voltages of high magnitude as a result of intermittent arcs are reviewed and extended in order to obtain the highest voltages on typical polyphase systems with the range of natural frequencies and attenuation factors that are encountered in practice. Previous studies are of limited scope and apply principally to the case of an arcing ground on an ungrounded system. The present study shows broadly the range of transient voltages which may be produced with intermittent arcs and applies to switching operations as well as arcing grounds. A typical transmission system is studied with the aid of the a-c network calculator. One of the principal variable factors in this study is the method of system grounding and this includes a range of both resistance and reactance between the limits of a solidly grounded system and an ungrounded system. The study is carried out for four different conditions, namely: (1) arcing grounds, (2) de-energizing an unfaulted line section, (3) de-energizing a line section with a fault on one phase, and (4) de-energizing a line section with a fault on two phases."
"An inspection of switching transients shows that the resistances of the circuits play an important part in limiting the amplitudes and the durations. Although only a few typical circuits have been analyzed, the general damping effect of resistance has been shown. The calculation of more complicated circuits becomes extremely difficult if the resistances, reactances, and capacitances are all considered. Consequently, calculations of more complicated circuits generally are limited to a consideration of the inductances and capacitances only. The damping of the transients is not included in the calculations and approximations for them have to be made. It is believed that the charts presented in this paper will help in choosing suitable damping factors. In the design of circuit breakers resistors can be used to increase the interrupting ability of the circuit breaker at the expense of simplicity in construction. The resistances of the are spaces of circuit breakers can appreciably influence switching transients by increasing the damping of the circuit."
"Air circuit breakers for lower voltages of simple design are being replaced by improved types, which incorporate specially designed circuit-interrupting devices for the purpose of improving the interrupting efficiency and minimizing the formation of arc flame and gases. A new form of deionizing arc interrupter is described which is equally effective for both d-c and a-c circuits. A new air circuit breaker has been designed to utilize this interrupter in which carbon arcing contacts are replaced by refractory metal, and laminated-brush-type main contacts are replaced by silver-faced solid copper. These improvements have led to greatly increased current-carrying capacity in breakers of a given size and also large increases in interrupting capacity with a minimum of noise and flame, which permits the breakers to be readily mounted in enclosures and cubicles of small physical size."
"The ``De-ion'' principle of arc interruption in air has been applied over a wide range of a-c services. Difficult switching problems have been met by them. A new breaker has been developed and tested in excess of 37,000 amperes for the 15-kv powerhouse class. It may be supplied for masonry or steel-cell mounting or as part of complete metal-clad switching equipment."
"There are occasional demands for high-voltage circuit breakers to interrupt in five cycles or less, and to meet this demand, a ``De-ion grid'' interrupter has been developed which may be used in multiple unit groups for apparatus rated 138 to 230 kv. Records of field tests up to 2,250,000 kva at 220,000 volts are given, showing interrupting times averaging 2.6 cycles (50-cycle frequency). Cathode-ray oscillograms indicate a comparatively small amount of transient overvoltage, less than would be expected from the usual magnetic oscillograph records. With the fast breaker operation, the apparent system voltage dip was small, and freedom from system disturbance and loss of synchronous equipment is noteworthy."
"This paper reviews the literature relating to the effect of temperature on the life of class A insulation. It presents test data on aging of built-up samples 100 mils thick, of varnished cloth, both black and yellow, over the temperature range 105 to 200 degrees centigrade. The effect of temperature on the insulation was measured by three different methods-physical condition by visual observation, bending of the insulation to produce cracking, and the lowering of the breakdown voltage of samples which had been immersed in water. The final results are given in the form of temperature-time curves for several degrees of deterioration as measured by each of the tests."
"This paper reviews principles of rating of general-purpose a-c motors, particularly in relation to overload torque and temperature limits. The overload capacity of an electric motor is limited, first, by its stalling, or breakdown torque, and, second, by its operating temperature. The breakdown torque, analogous to the stalling torque of a gas engine, is roughly proportional to the motor size and the square of its magnetic flux density. The temperature limitation is exactly analogous to the temperature limit of a transformer, the useful life of the insulation being reduced exponentially as the temperature is raised. The increased variety of motor uses in recent years, especially for automatic operation of refrigerator compressors, air conditioning, pumps, and other mechanical devices, has led to more exact methods of application, utilizing motor overload capacity and matching torque characteristics to the driven equipment. Under this economic pressure, motor overload capacities have been increased over the requirements of present standards, and small motors are now commonly used on intermittent overloads far beyond their continuous ratings. It is proposed, therefore, that American standards be revised to provide for increased values of breakdown torque and service factor in the smaller motor ratings, and that permissible intermittent duty cycles be defined, enabling the full economic life of the motor to be utilized."
"The ``American Standards for Rotating Electrical Machinery'' (American Standards Association) prescribe that the temperature rise of motors shall be measured by the thermometer method for purposes of rating. Definite limiting values of temperature rise are established for each type of machine. The AIEE Standards No. 1 fix conventional allowances of 15 degrees centigrade, 10 degrees centigrade, and 5 degrees centigrade between the actual hottest-spot temperature and the highest observable value of temperature as determined by thermometer, resistance, and embedded-detector methods, respectively. This paper presents information on the relations between the measured values of temperature rise by different methods as found in tests on several hundred induction motors ranging from 10 to 1,000 horsepower in rating. It is shown that, with modern motor construction, variations of 20 degrees centigrade or more are sometimes obtained by the thermometer method on a given machine depending on location of thermometers or thermocouples, whereas the resistance measurements give relatively consistent values of temperature rise. It is therefore suggested that the standards for temperature-rise measurements be revised, and that the resistance method be adopted for all forms of enclosed or protected machines which are not readily accessible for application of thermometers on laminations, insulated windings, and other adjacent parts."
"The horsepower rating of a motor carries a dual implication-first, torque ability; second, temperature rise. The two are frequently confused. In selecting motors for duty-cycle jobs the two concepts should be considered separately. The motor rating and type should be chosen to fit the torque requirements of the job. The proper time rating or service factor to associate with this horsepower rating to insure satisfactory insulation life can be determined from the duty cycle. Use of oversize continuously rated motors instead of short-time-rated motors to secure high torque ability on variable, load jobs imposes an economic loss. Frequent starting and reversing or starting high inertia loads imposes a temperature hazard frequently greater than heavy overloads, Horsepower rating as now understood is not a satisfactory criterion of a motor's reversing ability. These topics are developed by means of simple hydraulic analogies."
"The life of cellulose insulation in oil has been investigated as a function of temperature under conditions of free access to oxygen and also in an inert atmosphere. Temperatures up to 140 degrees centigrade have been used. An attempt has been made also to study the life of oils as a function of oxygen concentration in an actual transformer at various temperatures. The amount of oxygen to produce a given acidity was also determined. On the basis of these data on oils, an attempt has been made to calculate rates of oxygen absorption by oil which may be used to estimate the relative deterioration in transformers of other dimensions. The results show cellulose deteriorates only mechanically, retaining its electrical properties. It is subject to both temperature and oxidation effects, the temperature effect, of course, taking place above 105 degrees centigrade."
"Analysis of operating characteristics shows that fixed shunt capacitors may be used to provide voltage correction up to approximately three per cent on a typical four-kv distribution circuit. Installation of capacitors up to this limit, or to unity power factor on the feeder if that occurs with less capacity, generally gives voltage improvement at minimum cost. Additional correction can be secured with a set of automatic voltage boosters beyond the shunt capacitors, except that single-phase taps from near the feeding point should have the other phases extended first to secure lowest cost. This procedure requires only three different devices, a 30-kva single-phase capacitor, a 90-to 180-kva three-phase capacitor, and a 5-kva automatic booster with two 1.33-percent steps, to secure appreciable economies in distribution cost."

"MEMBERS of the engineering profession are becoming increasingly sensitive to their social obligations both collectively and individually. This is no new thing in the profession. Indeed for as far back as I can remember, engineers have questioned whether the profession occupied the place that it should have in organized society, and to a degree whether it was discharging its obligations to society. The creation of the American Engineering Council gives organic expression to this concern on the part of the profession."

"RECENT demonstrations of artificial lightning showed two significant developments. The first is the use in factory production-line tests of the high-voltage high-current surge generator; the second is the achievement in the laboratory of so-called “hot” lightning, which has all the components of natural lightning. The demonstrations were made by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company at Sharon, Pa., where the surge generator is being used to test distribution transformers of the completely self-protected type. The generator which produces the “hot” lightning is being used in the company's research laboratories."

The following are the Institute members who have reached member-forlife status since publication of the last previous list in the July 1938 issue."

"DURING the past several years the company with which the writer is associated has been conducting an extensive research and engineering study of the possibilities of high-voltage cable utilizing gas as a pressure medium. The purpose has been to develop a practical cable system of this type and determine its best field of usefulness from an engineering and economic standpoint. The results of this work to date will be outlined in the present paper."
"VARIOUS methods for the accurate determination of stray load loss in induction machines have been devised in recent years. Also older methods have been improved and developed as the nature of the loss has become better understood. The employment of different methods of testing on a given machine seldom shows complete agreement in results, due to minor discrepancies and inaccuracies inherent in the methods themselves. Another difficulty is that all of the plans proposed to date require a high degree of skill and experience on the part of the testing technician. Thus industry today finds itself in need of a test which will give highly accurate results and at the same time be simple and easy to perform. The purpose of this paper is to describe a new method of testing — termed the “reverse-rotation test” — which will more nearly meet these requirements. The theoretical basis and the assumptions involved are discussed. Tests to determine the accuracy of the method have been made on two squirrel-cage motors of somewhat different characteristics by various methods of testing. The results of these investigations are described and curves are given showing the degree of exactness obtained. While the method includes assumptions regarding compensating effects involving minor components of the loss, its over-all accuracy for the motors tested is shown by comparison with the values obtained by other methods having high precision."

"A TYPICAL electric drive for a modern 84-inch supercalender and winder consists of a 200-horsepower adjustable-speed driving motor, two 20-horsepower motors for winder drums, a 150-kw variable-voltage motor generator set with 30-kw winder generator and exciter, full magnetic control with large motor-operated rheostat, and an operator's panel. The drive will provide a threading speed of 50 feet per minute and a wide range of many productive calendering speeds to a maximum which may be 2,000 feet per minute. With auxiliary equipment on the winder slitters, and pressure-applying arrangement, the operator has full control of the calender speed, starting and stopping, roll pressures, and winder tensions at a central point."
"SINCE the discovery by Hull1 that oxide-coated cathodes could be used as commercially practical thermionic emitters in gas-filled tubes, these tubes have found extensive use. For high-voltage d-c power supplies two-element mercury-vapor rectifiers have almost entirely replaced rotating machines and the earlier high-vacuum tube rectifiers. The addition of a grid to the gas-filled thermionic rectifier yields the thyratron which is used in regulated rectifiers, for the inversion of direct current to alternating current, and as a sensitive relay in numerous industrial control circuits. The discovery by Slepian and Ludwig2 of the ignitor principle in initiating the arc spot on a mercury-pool cathode provided a ready means for controlling current flow in tubes with mercury-pool cathodes and the ignitron has now shown itself to have a large field of application."
"THE universal use of amplitude modulation in radio broadcasting service has led to several formidable problems in the design of broadcast transmitting equipment. Improvements in technique which permitted the complete modulation of a carrier (100 per cent modulation) raised new problems in connection with the conversion efficiency of the final radio-frequency amplifier stage. Continued research has resulted in such developments as the high-level plate-modulated amplifier, the high-efficiency linear amplifier, outphasing modulation, and others."
"A new carrier telephone system is described, together with its application in the long-distance telephone plant.

"FLEXIBLE electronic control circuits for the precise timing of resistance welders have been utilized thus far primarily on large welders. This paper describes a new circuit using recently developed types of cold-cathode electronic tubes which makes the application of such control economically practicable to small as well as large welders. The advantages of precise timing of welds by electronic means are well recognized, particularly for exact duplication of welds and for fabrication of materials difficult to weld or subject to physical or chemical changes if over-heated. Utilization of the method on small laboratory or industrial welders may render expedient processes that heretofore were considered unavailable except for large-scale production."
"ELECTRIC WELDING could be pictured very accurately to an electrical engineer as an attempt at maintenance and control of a short circuit. In resistance welding, whether spot, butt, roller seam, flash, or projection, it is an actual short circuit with definite resistance and low voltage drop. The arc is the maintenance of a short circuit in a very unstable medium, generally air, with a comparatively high voltage and nature conspiring to extinguish it. The “holding” of a metal arc is especially difficult as one electrode is continuously melting away into the other electrode called the “work.”"

"THE use of nickel and certain nickel alloys for the production of cathode-ray tubes is proving an important factor in the practical development of television. The cathode-ray tube, which translates electrical impulses into visual patterns, is an essential element of modern television sets.

The screen is illuminated at the point of impact, and the beam, swinging across it at tremendous speed, creates the television image."

"Incandescent-Lamp Ratings. A movement is under way in continental Europe to change the ratings of incandescent lamps from watts t o decalumens.

Were adequate levels of lighting intensities n ow generally prevalent, the change in rating would seem logical; but since in fact such levels are still far from attainment in most lighting installations, there would seem to be a strong argument in support of the contention that such change in lamp ratings would be premature."

"IT IS well known that when any portion of an electrical circuit is either opened or closed a transient condition will usually exist for some period, depending on the damping, before the circuit assumes its new steady state. In power circuits, such switching operations are the application and removal of faults or loads and the connecting or separating of various parts of a system. The transient conditions resulting from these switching operations give rise in some cases to overvoltages, which can be calculated by straightforward and more or less well-known methods, if the transient circuit parameters are known. However, in some instances voltages much higher than those predicted by such calculations have been obtained, and various explanations1–9 have been offered for these occurrences."

"This paper summarizes the results of an investigation of transient voltages on power systems caused by switching and faults. The transient voltages on power systems as measured by the “klydonograph” are reviewed and compared with the flash-over values of transmission-line insulation. It is shown that the higher values of transient voltages are produced by intermittent arcs. In part I, the various theories for the production of transient voltages of high magnitude as a result of intermittent arcs are reviewed and extended in order to obtain the highest voltages on typical polyphase systems with the range of natural frequencies and attenuation factors that are encountered in practice. Previous studies are of limited scope and apply principally to the case of an arcing ground on an ungrounded system. The present study shows broadly the range of transient voltages which may be produced with intermittent arcs and applies to switching operations as well as arcing grounds. A typical transmission system is studied with the aid of the a-c network calculator. One of the principal variable factors in this study is the method of system grounding and this includes a range of both resistance and reactance between the limits of a solidly grounded system and an ungrounded system. The study is carried out for four different conditions, namely: (1) arcing grounds, (2) de-energizing an unfaulted line section, (3) de-energizing a line section with a fault on one phase, and (4) de-energizing a line section with a fault on two phases. The results of this study are presented in graphical form in part II and show many interesting properties of systems with respect to the method of grounding, and the characteristics of transient voltages for the different switching and fault conditions. It is the authors' opinion that the transient voltages due to. faults and switching deserve more attention than they have received within the last few years."
"THE voltage recovery transient appearing across the terminals of a circuit-interrupting device has been the subject of numerous studies during the past ten years. Their importance has justified these studies because they determine in part the severity of the duty impressed upon circuit-interrupting devices. These studies have consisted of mathematical analyses of circuit conditions, calculating board investigations and studies of oscillographic records of the actual transients, as they are obtained on systems and in high-power laboratories.1"
"WITH the increased use of protector tubes, a thorough knowledge of the recovery voltages to which they may be subjected has become highly desirable. The current range over which a tube can be expected to function successfully is necessarily dependent on the voltage recovery characteristics of the system in which the tube is applied. Since many systems have a large range of fault currents for the different fault and system conditions, it is essential that the corresponding voltage recovery characteristics be carefully considered. This paper presents the results of an investigation to determine and evaluate the importance of the factors which influence the voltage recovery characteristics of power systems. A very large number of tests were made on a specially designed miniature equivalent circuit representing a transmission line, connected apparatus, and the fault-clearing device. In that a miniature system was used, this investigation is similar to that made by Messrs. Evans and Monteith and presented in two recent papers.1,2 The results presented in this paper represent refinements and extensions to the understanding of the phenomena which will be of interest to both designers and users of protector tubes or other fault-clearing devices. Factors which have not been evaluated previously are shown to influence the phenomena considerably."
"Air circuit breakers for lower voltages of simple design are being replaced by improved types, which incorporate specially designed circuit-interrupting devices for the purpose of improving the interrupting efficiency and minimizing the formation of arc flame and gases. A new form of deionizing arc interrupter is described which is equally effective for both d-c and a-c circuits. A new air circuit breaker has been designed to utilize this interrupter in which carbon arcing contacts are replaced by refractory metal, and laminated-brush-type main contacts are replaced by silver-faced solid copper. These improvements have led to greatly increased current-carrying capacity in breakers of a given size and also large increases in interrupting capacity with a minimum of noise and flame, which permits the breakers to be readily mounted in enclosures and cubicles of small physical size."
"The “De-ion” principle of arc interruption in air has been applied over a wide range of a-c services. Difficult switching problems have been met by them. A new breaker has been developed and tested in excess of 37,000 amperes for the 15-kv powerhouse class. It may be supplied for masonry or steel-cell mounting or as part of complete metal-clad switching equipment."
"There are occasional demands for high-voltage circuit breakers to interrupt in five cycles or less, and to meet this demand, a “De-ion grid” interrupter has been developed which may be used in multiple unit groups for apparatus rated 138 to 230 kv. Records of field tests up to 2,250,000 kva at 220,000 volts are given, showing interrupting times averaging 2.6 cycles (50-cycle frequency). Cathode-ray oscillograms indicate a comparatively small amount of transient overvoltage, less than would be expected from the usual magnetic oscillograph records. With the fast breaker operation, the apparent system voltage dip was small, and freedom from system disturbance and loss of synchronous equipment is noteworthy."

"WHETHER engineers should assume a larger measure of social responsibility has been debated extensively during the last decade with practical results that are not impressive, yet there appears to be significant crystallization of professed opinion. While the view still lingers here and there that the engineer should stick to his technical knitting, letting other professional men worry about the social consequences of his work, there is nevertheless a pervasive and growing opinion that he should play a more active part in the social realm and that his educational preparation should take this aim into account. However, the extent of the discussion and of apparent agreement upon this point is out of all proportion to the practical results, as measured either by active participation or by changes in educational programs looking to participation. Progress seems to be stymied biologically; after professional maturity, we seem to exhibit a certain elasticity of professed view but tend nevertheless to cling tenaciously to established habits. Not having participated, we don't start. Thus as a profession of engineers and educators we seem to agree upon principle, and more or less let it go at that."
"Some of the human relationships involved between management and workers, business and its customers, and business and government are discussed here by a prominent power-company executive, who takes as his text the statement that “the strength of human feeling is still the most potent of all forces affecting the affairs of the world.”"
"AT THE summer convention meeting of the AIEE board of directors June 29, 1939, at San Francisco, Calif., the June 1, 1939, AIEE draft of Model Law for Registration of Engineers was adopted by unanimous vote. Therefore it appears timely to outline the origin and development of this draft, and to indicate how it may be used."
"Preceded by a historical outline of the use of synthetic materials for insulating electric conductors, this article reviews in some detail the use of these materials on magnet wire, with particular reference to the recent introduction of the new insulating coating called “Formex” which is a synthetic resin embodying polyvinyl formal and is applied to wires by the floating die method. Comparative tests show this new material to be markedly superior to former enamel insulating coatings."
"Arrangements are being completed for the AIEE Middle Eastern District meeting and Student Branch convention to be held in Scranton, Pa., October 11–13. Headquarters for the meeting will be at Hotel Casey. The local committees have arranged an attractive and diversified technical program of five morning and afternoon sessions. A testimonial luncheon in honor of Doctor C. F. Scott, AIEE past-president and founder of Student Branches, is being sponsored by the Branches, and separate meetings of Branch counselors and Branch chairmen have been arranged. Among interesting inspection trips scheduled is one through anthracite-coal mines. Entertainment and social gatherings have been arranged for the evenings, with a special program for women guests, who are urged to attend the meeting."
"THE AIEE Great Lakes District extends a cordial invitation to attend the meeting in Minneapolis, September 27–29, 1939. Headquarters will be in the Hotel Nicollet. An excellent technical program, supplemented by interesting inspection trips and entertainment, is offered for members, their families, and friends of the Institute. Student members will find a special program arranged for them, with members of their own group offering papers for discussion."
"For the first meeting of the year 1939–40, the AIEE Connecticut Section will hold a testimonial dinner to Charles Felton Scott on his 75th birthday. The meeting will be held at the New Haven Lawn Club at 7:00 p.m., Tuesday, September 19, 1939. Approximately 20 leading engineering and scientific societies with which Professor Scott has been closely associated in his long career are co-operating with the Connecticut Section to honor him on this occasion."

"This paper reviews the literature relating to the effect of temperature on the life of class A insulation. It presents test data on aging of built-up samples 100 mils thick, of varnished cloth, both black and yellow, over the temperature range 105 to 200 degrees centigrade. The effect of temperature on the insulation was measured by three different methods — physical condition by visual observation, bending of the insulation to produce cracking, and the lowering of the breakdown voltage of samples which had been immersed in water. The final results are given in the form of temperature-time curves for several degrees of deterioration as measured by each of the tests."
"This paper reviews principles of rating of general-purpose a-c motors, particularly in relation to overload torque and temperature limits. The overload capacity of an electric motor is limited, first, by its stalling, or breakdown torque, and, second, by its operating temperature. The breakdown torque, analogous to the stalling torque of a gas engine, is roughly proportional to the motor size and the square of its magnetic flux density. The temperature limitation is exactly analogous to the temperature limit of a transformer, the useful life of the insulation being reduced exponentially as the temperature is raised. The increased variety of motor uses in recent years, especially for automatic operation of refrigerator compressors, air conditioning, pumps, and other mechanical devices, has led to more exact methods of application, utilizing motor overload capacity and matching torque characteristics to the driven equipment. Under this economic pressure, motor overload capacities have been increased over the requirements of present standards, and small motors are now commonly used on intermittent overloads far beyond their continuous ratings. It is proposed, therefore, that American standards be revised to provide for increased values of breakdown torque and service factor in the smaller motor ratings, and that permissible intermittent duty cycles be denned, enabling the full economic life of the motor to be utilized. It is also proposed that the starting current be recognized as a convenient and accurate measure of induction-motor breakdown torque, or momentary torque capacity, and that starting current values be established on a logical and consistent basis for both single-phase and polyphase motors. Specific recommendations are given in the paper for rated characteristics and operating limits under this starting current-temperature system of rating, and the economic advantages to the industry to be gained by their adoption are pointed out, including safer wiring and control systems and a reduced variety of special motors."
"The “American Standards for Rotating Electrical Machinery” (American Standards Association) prescribe that the temperature rise of motors shall be measured by the thermometer method for purposes of rating. Definite limiting values of temperature rise are established for each type of machine. The AIEE Standards No. 1 fix conventional allowances of 15 degrees centigrade, 10 degrees centigrade, and 5 degrees centigrade between the actual hottest-spot temperature and the highest observable value of temperature as determined by thermometer, resistance, and embedded-detector methods, respectively. This paper presents information on the relations between the measured values of temperature rise by different methods as found in tests on several hundred induction motors ranging from 10 to 1,000 horsepower in rating. It is shown that, with modern motor construction, variations of 20 degrees centigrade or more are sometimes obtained by the thermometer method on a given machine depending on location of thermometers or thermocouples, whereas the resistance measurements give relatively consistent values of temperature rise. It is therefore suggested that the standards for temperature-rise measurements be revised, and that the resistance method be adopted for all forms of enclosed or protected machines which are not readily accessible for application of thermometers on laminations, insulated windings, and other adjacent parts."
"THERE are three fundamental methods of temperature determination1 which might be applied to squirrel-cage motors, namely: 1. The thermometer method 2. The resistance method 3. The embedded-detector method"
"The horsepower rating of a motor carries a dual implication — first, torque ability; second, temperature rise. The two are frequently confused. In selecting motors for duty-cycle jobs the two concepts should be considered separately. The motor rating and type should be chosen to fit the torque requirements of the job. The proper time rating or service factor to associate with this horsepower rating to insure satisfactory insulation life can be determined from the duty cycle. Use of oversize continuously rated motors instead of short-time-rated motors to secure high torque ability on variable load jobs imposes an economic loss. Frequent starting and reversing or starting high inertia loads imposes a temperature hazard frequently greater than heavy overloads. Horsepower rating as now understood is not a satisfactory criterion of a motor's reversing ability. These topics are developed by means of simple hydraulic analogies."
"The life of cellulose insulation in oil has been investigated as a function of temperature under conditions of free access to oxygen and also in an inert atmosphere. Temperatures up to 140 degrees centigrade have been used. An attempt has been made also to study the life of oils as a function of oxygen concentration in an actual transformer at various temperatures. The amount of oxygen to produce a given acidity was also determined. On the basis of these data on oils, an attempt has been made to calculate rates of oxygen absorption by oil which may be used to estimate the relative deterioration in transformers of other dimensions. The results show cellulose deteriorates only mechanically, retaining its electrical properties. It is subject to both temperature and oxidation effects, the temperature effect, of course, taking place above 105 degrees centigrade."
"Analysis of operating characteristics shows that fixed shunt capacitors may be used to provide voltage correction up to approximately three per cent on a typical four-kv distribution circuit. Installation of capacitors up to this limit, or to unity power factor on the feeder if that occurs with less capacity, generally gives voltage improvement at minimum cost. Additional correction can be secured with a set of automatic voltage boosters beyond the shunt capacitors, except that single-phase taps from near the feeding point should have the other phases extended first to secure lowest cost. This procedure requires only three different devices, a 30-kva single-phase capacitor, a 90- to 180-kva three-phase capacitor, and a 5-kva automatic booster with two 1.33-per-cent steps, to secure appreciable economies in distribution cost."

"The need for faster railroad schedules has necessitated the development of new motive-power units capable of sustained high-speed operation. Newest entrant in that realm is the steam-electric locomotive recently placed in operation by the Union Pacific Railroad."
"By means of the device described in this article, which simulates in a mechanical sense the electrical phenomena of traveling waves on power-transmission lines, various types of surges may be visualized and relations fundamental in transmission theory may be deduced."
"COMPUTATIONS of voltage regulation ordinarily are based on the use of an equivalent circuit for the four-winding transformer, using either a six-branch network, or preferably the eight-branch network described by Starr.1 Determination of the equivalent circuit — a tedious analytical task — appears to be unnecessary, however. As a simpler alternative for determining voltage regulation with load on three windings and the fourth winding acting as a source, the necessary constants may be obtained directly from the usual two-terminal impedances."
"THE General Electric Company's annual analysis of population reported as being served at various lighting voltages shows a continued shift toward 120 volts, with decreases in both the 115- and the 110-volt percentages. The percentage of population receiving lighting service at 125 and 130 volts is almost negligible (actually less than one-tenth of one per cent) and shows no sign of increasing. The trend is as shown in the following table."
"IN A thought-provoking article published in the August 17, 1939, issue of Engineering News Record, Farley Gannett asks why so few engineers of today have obtained fame comparable to that of many engineers of past decades and puts forward several of the most plausible explanations that have been suggested to him. Excerpts from the article are given in the following paragraphs."
"The many and varied successes in technology have inspired in the minds of millions unskilled in technological methods the belief that such methods are directly applicable to social problems. The engineer should be the first to recognize the danger in this misconception and should do what he can to educate and warn the lay public that principles applicable to his inanimate problems cannot be applied directly in the domain of social phenomena."
"OF THE 37,098,084 telephones in service on January 1, 1937, approximately one-half, or 18,433,400, were in the United States, according to a survey recently compiled by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. By continents, there were 19,952,423 in North America, 13,513,152 in Europe, 1,690,978 in Asia, 840,880 in Australia and other Pacific Islands, 765,435 in South America and 335,216 in Africa. Of the total number of telephones in use about 93 per cent could be reached by a subscriber in the Bell System. Private companies operated 22,538,753 or 61 per cent and government systems the remainder. There were 18,300,000 automatic or dial telephones. Two American cities, Washington, D. C, and San Francisco, Calif., lead the world's urban service with 37.43 and 37.00 telephones per 100 inhabitants, respectively, followed by Stockholm, Sweden, with 34.78 and Denver, Colo., with 30.96."
"OF ALL FIRES in the United States and Canada during the years 1936 and 1937 (excluding those where lightning was the initial cause) 11.2 per cent were of electrical origin, and the loss was 10.9 per cent of all fire loss. These figures from the records of the National Fire Protection Association indicate that for all types of property, electricity ranked third as a cause of fire. The records of the Associated Factory Mutual Fire Insurance Companies on the same basis show that for industrial plants, electricity rates a strong first. For the years 1931 to 1938 inclusive, 19.8 per cent of the fires for which claims were made in Factory Mutual plants were caused by electricity, and the loss was 19.2 per cent of their total fire loss. That is, one out of every five fires was of electrical origin."
"Standardization of aircraft equipment is desirable when such standardization does not interfere with efficient operation. Equations developed for the standardization of electrical equipment indicate that the voltage for a large number of airplanes with d-c systems using storage batteries to carry peak loads can be standardized advantageously at 24 volts."
"IN ADDITION to the 95 technical papers which together with their related discussions will have been preprinted in the monthly Transactions sections of Electrical Engineering by the close of the current calendar year, 28 others will be included in the 1939 annual volume of AIEE Transactions. For the convenience of members and subscribers who desire to secure a complete file of these 28 technical papers and their related discussions, a special “Transactions Supplement” will be published in December. This supplement together with the 12 issues of Electrical Engineering for 1939 will provide in complete form all the technical papers and discussions published by the Institute during the year."
"Arack-RAIL Diesel-electric locomotive, said to be the first of its kind, has been built by the General Electric Company for the Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway, replacing the tilted steam locomotives used on the cog railway since its completion in 1891. Instead of hauling its load, the locomotive pushes a 50-passenger car from Manitou, Colo., at 6,562 feet elevation, to the top of Pike's Peak, 14,109 feet above sea level. The average grade is 16 per cent; the steepest 25 per cent. The new locomotive can provide traction at the wheels as well as t h e rack rail, but not simultaneously. It has two axles, weighs 20 tons, and is powered by three generating units, each rated 160 horsepower at an elevation of 1,800 feet. One control station is provided, and t h e same standard electric-drive equipment as is used in the company's new Diesel-electric industrial locomotives."
"SECTION activities were the subject of discussion at the recent summer convention conference of officers, delegates, and members, as reported in the August issue, pages 352–3. At that time a mimeographed booklet on Section activities was distributed to the Section delegates. The booklet, which summarizes the information accumulated by the Sections committee during the past few years, has been prepared by the committee as a means of acquainting new Section officers with the types of activities found most fruitful in various Sections. The material has been accumulated since 1937, when the Sections analyzed their aims and activities (see Electrical Engineering, August 1937, page 1046; March 1938, page 134; August 1938, page 351; August 1939, pages 352–3)."
"The National Safety Council's annual statistical report on accident rates in publicutility companies during 1938 shows 11.37 injuries per million man-hours of exposure and 1.97 days lost per thousand man-hours of exposure. The first, or frequency rate, is 16 per cent lower than in 1937, and the second, or severity rate, 1 per cent lower. The average frequency rate for all industries is 12.18; the average severity rate 1.53."

" It is very gratifying to one who has given much thought to the subject of education for engineers to note that at least one branch is receiving serious consideration. The general trend of electrical-engineering development makes it imperative to give the matter most serious consideration. The article entitled \"Graduate Training for Engineers\" (ibid, vol 58, no 3, pp 118-122, 1939) lays down the general problem most capably but I disagree with the proposition put forward that the solution to the problem of training men having \"the ability to do new and difficult feats in industry\" is to be found in postgraduate training. The commentor argues that engineers may be divided into three broad categories, namely: development engineers, applicational engineers, and operational engineers and discusses educational objectives for each. He then argues that the educational and training requirements for the three branches are entirely different. He considers a great deal of time, valuable energy, and money is wasted in trying to provide a curriculum that will turn out engineers suitable for any of the three categories."

"THIS PAPER outlines briefly some of the technical, economic, and psychological aspects of the methods of rating electrical machinery and apparatus. Some proposed modifications of existing standards also are discussed, with the idea of bringing the standards into better agreement with present-day conditions, knowledge, and practices."
"THE PURPOSE of this paper is to describe a new practical method of utilizing latent short-time overload capacity to the fullest extent, dependent upon actual copper temperature and automatically taking into account the factors that affect the life of a transformer."
"THE EFFECTS of temperature on electrical machinery are usually considered in connection with the deterioration of insulation used on the active conductors themselves. There are, however, many other parts of these machines where temperature effects are important and vitally affect the design of the machine. Unless provision is made in the design of machines to take care of these effects, unsatisfactory operation or reduced life may result. These effects on machine construction may be considered in three groups."
"This paper describes the procedure and practical results to date in applying single-phase motors to refrigeration compressors. The applications are primarily torque applications, temperature considerations being of secondary importance. A line of high-torque motors has been developed to meet the high starting and accelerating torques demanded by the compressors. Utilization of these torques results in running loads considerably higher than rated name-plate loads, without exceeding safe operating temperatures for the insulation life requirement. To meet these requirements a revised method of rating refrigeration motors on a starting and accelerating torque per horsepower and a starting efficiency basis is described. This method more clearly specifies a motor so that a more satisfactory application would be obtainable both from the standpoint of the user and the public utility company or code authority."
"The types of resistance-welding applications requiring precision control heretofore characterized by electronic equipment are well-known. Attempts to extend the field of application to borderline operations have not met with complete success because of the initial expense and complicated nature of the control available. A simplified form of precision control consisting of a synchronized magnetic contactor and motor-driven timer overcomes these objections without compromise on results obtained."
"Operating and test data concerning the maximum safe loading of impregnated-paper-insulated lead-covered cable are presented. The results of the study may be summarized as follows: 1. The occasional operation of cable at higher temperatures than are permitted by present temperature rules effects considerable economy. 2. During emergencies, temperatures of 5 to 35 degrees centigrade (depending on kind of cable) above those permitted by the rules are safe for the insulation. 3. For extra-high-voltage solid-type cable, void formation in insulation and expansion of lead sheaths may limit allowable temperatures and temperature ranges. 4. Cracking of lead sheaths due to reciprocating cable movement into manholes may limit the temperature range for usual daily loading. Limitation is more severe for longer conduit lengths up to 500 feet, but changes little with increase from 500-to 1,000-foot lengths. 5. Cracking of sheaths in manholes due to cable movement may be reduced by improving manhole conditions. 6. For many cables a balanced design requires a lead-alloy sheath that gives increased resistance to effects of cable movement and of internal pressures. 7. Continuous field temperature surveys are essential to efficient use of large conduit and cable systems. 8. Only a small fraction of the cable ever operates at the higher temperatures. 9. Data on center empty-duct temperatures and on average heat losses over 24-hour periods give satisfactory results in heat calculations. 10. Other practices which increase load ratings are the use of different ratings for various periods of the year, the replacement of poor soil in special cases, and the use of extra-large conductors in warmer conduits."
"THE capital investment in the underground cable system of any large metropolitan utility is so great that any means of increasing its usefulness is of great and immediate interest. The operation of paper-insulated cables at higher copper temperatures than are accepted as normal, offers one obvious means of increasing the usefulness of the cable system where voltage regulation does not limit load."

"THERE appears in this issue of Electrical Engineering the usual annual notice inviting the membership to suggest to the national nominating committee candidates for the various national offices that will become vacant July 31 next. It recalls the comment occasionally heard that our elections of national officers are more or less “cut and dried,” that the rank and file of the membership can have little influence in the selection of our officers, and that, as a consequence, our elections are not carried out in the completely democratic spirit contemplated by the prescribed procedure. A review of our election machinery therefore is opportune at this time."
"With the development of practical polarizing sheets, polarized light, long known and employed by science, is being given increasingly wide use in engineering and industry. Its applications in the study of stresses, in photography, stereoscopic motion pictures, vehicle lighting, and display lighting, are among those mentioned by this author, who reviews polarized light for the engineer."
"Light and Safety. Records kept by L. J. Samson, city traffic engineer of Chicago, ill., show a large dividend in safety on the investment for lighting dangerous intersections with sodium-vapor lamps. For the year following the installation of the lamps, in November 1937, as compared with the preceding year, night accidents dropped from 95 to 40, or 58 per cent; the number of persons injured from 43 to 14, or 67 per cent; and property-damage collisions from 61 to 28, or 54 percent."
"The apparent magic that created great oil fields out of grassy marshlands is not a product of the divining rod but the result of the application of scientific principles involving the fundamentals of the science of applied geophysics. A review of the various methods of geophysical prospecting for oil, in which electricity has played a large part, is presented here. In addition to strictly electrical methods, electrical measurements provide a means of recording the results of other methods."
"To transmit its allotment of power from Boulder Dam to its system, the Southern California Edison Company, Ltd., has completed and recently placed in operation a 233-mile, single-circuit, 220-kv line of simple and time-tested design, the principal features of which are here outlined."

"COMPLETION of a hermetically sealed 100-ton 16-cylinder air-conditioning compressor unit driven by a 100-horsepower 1,150-rpm refrigerant-cooled motor recently was announced by the air-conditioning department of the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, East Springfield, Mass. The new unit is intended particularly for stores, factories, theaters, and similar applications. Of extremely compact design the unit is said to require only one-third the space that would be required by a compressor of conventional design for the same capacity, and to weigh only two-thirds as much."

"For the sixth general meeting of the Great Lakes District, held at the Nicollet Hotel in Minneapolis, Minn., September 27–29 inclusive, the Minnesota Section served as host. Although a majority of the approximately 90 members of this Section reside in the St. Paul-Minneapolis metropolitan area, the Section territory embraces not only all of the state of Minnesota but a double tier of the ten northwesterly counties of Wisconsin. The District itself embraces the six states of Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, and its “center of gravity” of membership in so far as members are concerned is in the vicinity of Chicago, some 400 miles south and east of Minneapolis. Considering this factor of distance, and considering also the American Legion convention in Chicago and the utilities convention in Indiana held the same week, the total attendance of 230 at Minneapolis, including 141 from outside the Section territory, constituted a worthwhile achievement in the opinion of observers, especially in view of the unusually high percentage of attendance at the several very active student and technical sessions."

"THE mercury-arc rectifier competes with the older well-established types of apparatus, the synchronous converter and motor generator set. Both of these types of apparatus are flexible in application as they may be adjusted through a range of different output characteristics and in the case of the booster-type converter and motor generator set, considerable range in voltage control is possible. In order to take full advantage of the desirable features of the mercury-arc rectifier, its output voltage should duplicate that of its rivals."
"THE Metropolitan Edison Company, operating in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, has a total of 264 miles of 66,000-volt overhead transmission lines, to which interconnections at this voltage with the systems of the Pennsylvania Water and Power Company and the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company add 59 miles, making a total of 323 circuit miles. A single-line diagram of this system is shown in figure 1, which also shows the various types of line construction used, ranging from all-wood construction to all-steel construction, with overhead ground wires and counterpoise. The system neutral is grounded through transformers at West Reading, Middletown, and the Holtwood station of the Pennsylvania Water and Power Company. At West Reading, the grounding bank consists of three single-phase 500-kva 66,000–13,200-volt transformers connected wye-delta, and at Middletown a three-phase zigzag transformer having an equivalent transformer capacity of 1,000 kva. At Holtwood each 66,000-volt line, as shown in figure 1, terminates in a 20,000-kva three-phase 69,000–13,200-volt wye-delta transformer, having the high-voltage neutral grounded through a 300-ohm reactor. The 13,200-volt winding of these transformers is connected to the 13,200-volt station bus."
"THE effectiveness of the Petersen coil in extinguishing line-to-ground arcs on a transmission system is ordinarily attributed to the fact that the current in the arc is kept at a low value. Another factor of perhaps greater importance is that characteristic of the Petersen-coil system which results in a very low rate of rise of recovery voltage across the arc terminals. Although this characteristic has long been recognized,1,2 the engineering literature would seem to indicate that its importance has not been thoroughly considered. This paper calls attention to the importance of the rate of rise of recovery voltage, presents the circuit theory pertaining to the voltage recovery rate, points out some practical aspects of the Petersen-coil system design, and compares the theory with published records of operation. It is hoped that this analysis will lead to a better understanding of Petersen-coil systems which will permit their more effective use. With continued study of system operating records, it may become possible to predict the effectiveness of a system even before it is built."
"MUTUAL INDUCTION is very much like friction in that it is a great blessing under certain conditions and an unmitigated nuisance under others. If it were not for mutual induction there would be no a-c systems as we know them today because there would be no transformers. It is apparent, therefore, that mutual induction is the basis of an entire industry that could not exist without it. On the other hand it has been the bane of the communication industry where induction between circuits is highly undesirable. There is a story told about one of the early long-distance open-wire telephone circuits having several parallel lines in which the experimenter at one end spoke to the man at the other end and asked “Do you hear me?” The reply was, “Perfectly.” The first man then asked the second, “Which line am I on?” and after a moment's hesitation the second replied, “All of them.” These two illustrations show that mutual induction may be either a blessing or a curse depending upon the circumstances under which it exists."
"ABOUT 1930 the manufacturers introduced the high-speed circuit breaker with operating times in the order of eight cycles and at the same time engineers awoke to the possibilities of high-speed or one-cycle relays. The general requirements for such relays were set forth at the time in two papers1,2 presented before the Institute."
"As part of a program of improvements made to the network analyzer in the electrical-engineering research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an instrument to measure watts and vars has been devised which imposes a negligible burden upon the network, is rapid in response, and has an error less than one-half per cent of full scale. The instrument consists of (1) a semistock electrodynamic wattmeter, (2) a negative-feedback vacuum-tube amplifier, and (3) a phase-shifting network. When the equipment is once assembled the presence of the amplifier may be ignored and the instrument used thereafter as any portable instrument. The principle of instruments of this kind has other important applications in the field of electrical measurements."
"COSTS of money, depreciation, and taxes now represent almost two-thirds of all electricity-supply costs. Other costs have been reduced to the point where it is difficult to effect further large reductions in them. It appears, therefore, that the major opportunities for improving the competitive position of electricity must now lie in the direction of lowering the fixed costs by reducing to a practical minimum the investment required to deliver adequate voltage and the nearest practicable approach to continuous power supply."

"A METHOD of protection of submarine cables by placement “underground” was described during the process of its development in an article written for Electrical Engineering in May 1938. The work then projected has since been successfully carried out, and the first cables scheduled to be plowed under, to protect them from being fouled by fishing gear dragged along the ocean bottom by steam trawlers, have been laid and buried in trenches to a depth of from half a foot to approximately two feet. In the latest operations, sections of cable 25 nautical miles (of 6,087 feet) in length have been dropped into a continuous furrow cut in the ocean bottom, from 500 to 2,700 feet below the surface of the sea. It is the purpose of this paper to describe the engineering features of the entrenching operation, and in a companion paper2 will be found a description of a device, the submarine-cable depthometer, by which is measured the depth, in inches below the ocean bottom surface, at which the plowed-in cable actually lies in its trench."
"The extensive use of rectangular conductors for large alternating currents has made the determination of their electrical characteristics a problem of practical importance. Although these conductors are usually used in groups and in special configurations, no solution other than that of direct measurement has been given even for the basic problem of the distribution of current in a single isolated conductor. The mechanical complications of the direct measurement method are great, and the results obtained are necessarily an approximation."
"THE PROBLEM of plowing submarine cables into the ground or sand making up the bottom of the ocean requires a means of checking the depth of burial of the cable after the plowing operation has been completed. Measuring the actual depth in inches below the surface of the ground is the purpose of a magnetic detecting and measuring device known as the cable depthometer. This magnetic detector is contained in a sled as shown in figure 1, designed for towing by the cable ship along the ocean bottom. The detecting operation utilizes the fact that ocean cables have a protective sheath of iron or steel wires around the copper core and the insulation. The magnetic field arising from the magnetization of the cable sheath, together with the distortion created in the earth's magnetic field by the cable sheath, generates an electromotive force in detecting coils in the sled, when these coils are moved in a substantially horizontal plane through such a field."
"THE ESSENTIAL operating facilities placed at the disposal of toll operators for the switching and completion of long-distance calls have, in a general sense, remained substantially unchanged since the early days of toll switching. It is still common practice, in toll offices, to have toll lines and local subscribers' trunks terminate in multiple jacks and lamp signals with associated cords and plugs to permit the operator to answer and extend calls between local stations and stations at distant toll centers. In addition, toll operators are still dependent on the assistance of inward and through operators for connecting within and through distant toll centers."
"THE rapidly increasing use of a-c contact welders in metal fabricating plants imposes single-phase low-power-factor fluctuating loads on plant power systems. The loads may range from a few kilo volt-amperes for a few cycles per weld, as in the case of a small spot welder, up to several thousand kilovolt-amperes for five to ten seconds per weld in the case of a large butt welder. Where the plant is supplied from a small private generating station, single-phase welding loads not only cause troublesome voltage fluctuations but may damage the damper windings of the generators. If power is purchased from a utility, voltage fluctuations may still be present, not only in the plant but often in the entire adjacent area. To eliminate such disturbances it has been necessary in numerous instances to install motor generators to serve as phase converters to supply single-phase power. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss the more common applications for single-phase welding generators and the electrical problems involved in each type of application."
"THE proper functioning of a high percentage of electrical equipment depends on electrical insulating mediums, such as oils, under conditions known to include corona discharge. This is particularly true in the case of high-voltage cables of the “solid” type."
"THE rapid increase in the use of a-c bridges for the measurement of electrical and nonelectrical quantities makes desirable a critical analysis of the performance characteristics of various types of bridge structures. The literature is replete with descriptions of multitudinous bridges and there is a great mass of analytical treatment and experimental data available concerning bridges designed for special purposes. The selection of a particular type of bridge is dictated by many conditions, the more important of which are: (a). Sensitivity requirements (b). Accuracy requirements (c). Magnitude and characteristics of quantity to be measured (d). Voltage and current requirements (e). Frequency (f). Availability of bridge components"
"THE “demand meter” has been used for approximately 40 years. The function of this device is to measure the “maximum demand” of the load taken by any user of electric service. This quantity, in turn, is used by most utilities in their rates for such service to their larger customers."
"This paper is an extension of the work reported in a paper of the same title by the writer and C. N. Weygandt.1 The production of subharmonic oscillations in a series circuit consisting of a capacitor and an iron-cored inductor is studied by the method of matching boundary conditions. The calculations are carried out by means of a new mechanical calculating device, and are verified by differential-analyzer solutions. A sufficient, but not necessary, criterion for stability is deduced. Some consideration is given to the effect of resistance in the circuit."
"In a recent paper “Similitude of Critical Conditions in Ferroresonant Circuits,”24 a generalized solution for the critical conditions of the series circuit was given. The same type of generalized treatment when applied to the parallel circuit yields a number of interesting conclusions to supplement those found for the series circuit."
"THERE are many types and characters of switch houses on a power system, and their importance varies through wide limits. Many features which are of great importance and value in one type of installation cannot be justified in others. Probably the most important switching center is that of a generating station located near the center of a load area. In such a station continuity of service is of maximum importance. A complete shutdown of such a plant affects a great number of power users of all classes and the damage can be very great physically, commercially, and politically. This paper will be confined to a discussion of the means which have been used, or are available, to improve the reliability of this type of station."
"IN THE past two or three years the question of modernization of generating stations and station equipment has been discussed liberally in the technical literature and in technical committees. It is the purpose of this paper to review the principal features of a modernization program undertaken by the Consolidated Edison Company of New York and its associated companies."
"LOCATED on the Passaic River, three miles from the business district of Newark, N. J., the Essex generating station of the Public Service Electric and Gas Company was designed and constructed in 1915–16, to supply the load of the Newark and surrounding area at 13 kv with ties of approximately 20,000 kva to the neighboring Marion generating station. By 1924, six generators had been installed, totaling 214,444 kva, and the switch house had been extended to the ultimate of the 1915 plans."
"THIS paper is being presented with several objects in view, to serve possibly as a guide or outline of procedure for companies undertaking a modernization program, to list the main items of equipment installed, to discuss why certain selections were made, and to aid engineers in studying their own stations by indicating dangerous conditions or weak equipment as found at the L Street station of the Boston Edison Company."
"THE FUNCTIONS ber x and bei x and their derivatives are frequently used in electrical-engineering problems connected with heavy conductors and with wires at radio frequencies. For instance, the current distribution and the resistance loss in a round conductor, or in a coreless induction furnace, are often computed by means of these functions."
"IN 1932 a new aluminum-nickel permanent-magnet material was announced. It may desirably contain a small percentage of cobalt and in that form is commercially available in castings from several dependable suppliers. A typical analysis is aluminum 12 per cent, nickel 20 per cent, cobalt 5 per cent, with the rest iron. As compared with previously available materials, it has such a high coercive force as to affect design radically. No discussion of the material itself will be given as this has been presented elsewhere.1–3"
"THE CALCULATION of switching surges occasioned by circuit-breaker operations requires that transformers, reactors, generators, and other apparatus be replaced by their equivalent circuits. To be of much practical use these equivalent circuits must be simple, as well as reasonably exact. Great accuracy, however, is not required — a 20-per-cent departure from exact values being regarded as tolerable. But the approximate circuit must be very simple; for it is merely one element in a network which may consist of many other elements, all of which enter into the equations which describe the switching surge."
"WHEN Marconi electrified the world in 1901 by sending radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean, he incidentally proved that the upper atmosphere is electrified. Diffraction was insufficient to explain the bending of the electromagnetic waves around the 30 degrees of the earth's curved surface. The waves could not penetrate the earth. So there was only one way they could go the incredible distance, and that was by reflection from one or more conducting strata in the atmosphere. So reasoned Professor A. E. Kennelly, and he published the idea a few months after Marconi's demonstration. Oliver Heaviside reached the same conclusion and published2 it at nearly the same time; his paper however mentioned only a single layer. This postulated layer was known for a number of years as the Kennelly-Heaviside layer, and the entire ionized region in the upper atmosphere which affects the transmission of radio waves is now called the ionosphere. Radio waves transmitted by means of it are called sky waves, in contradistinction to the ground waves, those which are propagated along the earth's surface."
"This paper deals with the fundamentals of resonant regulators for constant current, and compares them with other kinds of regulators. It also discusses the various forms such regulators may take, their applications and control, and protective equipment required for them. A simple method of predicting performance by means of the voltage diagram is developed."
"An automatic line voltage regulator is described which employs ferroresonance and operates without tubes or moving parts of any kind. The device requires no maintenance attention nor expense, is highly efficient, very accurate, and much faster in its response than previous large-size line regulators."
"This paper discusses the fundamental requirements for stability in a generator voltage regulating system having several time delays. A new rheostatic type of voltage regulator element is described, together with a method of introducing antihunting means into the regulating system. In the appendices, a mathematical treatment gives the requirements for stability and adequate damping for several typical voltage regulating systems. It is shown that with certain systems, theoretically perfect regulation and also high damping are possible."
"ONE of the most important variables in the resistance welding process is the temperature obtained in the region of the weld. If this temperature is too low, the parts will not unite; and if it is too high, a burned weld will result. Besides the necessity for the proper temperature at the surfaces to be joined, it is often essential to bring a considerable portion of the bodies to a plastic temperature in order that the pressure exerted by the electrodes can be transmitted to the surfaces to be joined. Furthermore, the temperature gradients and the rates of heating and cooling have an important bearing on the final quality of the weld. Consequently, it is desirable to have some method by which these quantities can be calculated."
"The reflection prospecting method measures depths to subsurface strata by recording the travel time of reflected sound waves. The acoustic energy of the sound wave is converted into electrical energy by a pickup, amplified, filtered, and recorded. The equipment described provides automatic gain control in the amplifier, filtering to eliminate frequencies outside the reflection spectrum, and means of recording reflections from several points on the earth's surface, together with the necessary timing mechanism."
"This paper summarizes the results of an investigation of the harmonic currents and voltages in the a-c circuits of grid-controlled rectifiers and inverters. The principal part of the paper presents the development of a theoretical method for predetermining the magnitude of the harmonics in terms of the d-c load current, the commutating reactance, the rectifier transformer secondary voltage, and the amount of grid control. Harmonic voltages in the supply circuit may then be calculated from the harmonic currents and the supply-circuit reactances at the various harmonic frequencies."
"AS SYSTEMS grow in complexity and service standards grow higher, the need for more accurate determination of system characteristics increases. From time to time the question of how to handle the impedance introduced into the circuit by a regulating transformer has arisen. This paper has been written to present general equations by means of which the equivalent circuit impedance of regulating transformers may readily be determined."
"IN THE analysis of power systems it is customary to represent generators, transformers, and transmission lines by their equivalent circuits. The resulting circuit network is solved either by representation on a network calculator, from which the solution is read directly, or analytically by successive simplification of the network. When the network has been simplified as far as possible, it is usually relatively easy to solve the simplified network, by the application of Kirchhoff's laws, for the currents in the remaining circuits and the voltages at the remaining terminals. When this solution has been obtained, the steps of simplification are reversed until the original network is restored, the currents and voltages being calculated at each step, until the desired quantities are finally obtained for the original network. When the system is unbalanced, as by an unbalanced fault condition, the method of symmetrical components is widely used. Equivalent networks are derived for the positive-, negative-, and zero-sequence components of current and voltage. Interconnections between the sequence networks are made, corresponding to the unbalanced condition, and the resulting network is solved by the methods just described."
"THE importance of the measurement of dielectric loss for determining the quality of high-voltage equipment has been well known for a long time by the high-voltage-cable industry and its measurement has been included in the international regulations for acceptance tests of cables. It was obvious that the same method that had been applied successfully to cables could be used also for testing other high-voltage devices, such as transformers, bushings, etc."
"IN RECENT years there has been an increasing interest in the use of substituted variables in the analysis of unbalanced three-phase circuits and machines. The best known and most widely used of the substituted variables are symmetrical components, introduced by Fortescue in 1918. In the method of symmetrical components the actual currents and voltages of the three phases of a three-phase circuit are replaced by the zero-sequence, positive-sequence, and negative-sequence currents and voltages, and, furthermore, the three-phase circuit itself is replaced for purposes of analysis by three fictitious single-phase circuits known as the sequence networks. This method has achieved extensive use in the analysis of polyphase machinery and in the making of fault studies on three-phase power systems. Another example of substituted variables is furnished by the direct-axis and quadrature-axis quantities as defined by Park2 in 1929, which have greatly facilitated the mathematical analysis of salient-pole synchronous machines."

"For at least three decades, light sources and their application continuously have undergone rapid changes. To provide the Institute membership with a record of these developments, it has been the policy of the AIEE committee on the production and application of light to prepare at periodic intervals reports reviewing the progress achieved during those intervals. The 1939–40 committee∗ presents in this report a summary of the epoch-making advancements since 1936, when the last previous report was published,1 prepared by a member and former chairman of the committee."
"Visitors to the General Motors “Futurama” at the 1939 New York World's Fair, an extensive scale model purporting to depict the America of tomorrow, were transported through the exhibit on a specially designed and constructed conveyer consisting of a continuous train of moving chairs almost one-third of a mile long. Loudspeakers provided each individual spectator with a running account of the changing scene throughout the tour."
"LIKE many other words in our language, “science” has more than one meaning. It may be defined as systematized knowledge in general and also as any branch thereof. When we think of the various branches of science, we are apt to stress those like astronomy or metallurgy that are inanimate, inorganic, impersonal. Occasionally, therefore, it is well to remember that there is another science, a very human one — anthropology — the science of man himself. As might be expected from the wide range of human activities, anthropology is a very broad subject and can be here outlined only in part. In so doing, that sword of Damocles, the possibility of error, which hangs over the head of every scientist, is acknowledged at the start."
"Twelve years' experience with the Philadelphia low-voltage a-c network, which differs materially from the more common types of networks, has proved it capable of meeting all the requirements of simplicity, reliability, and economy in the supply of high-grade electric service to the central business district of the city."
"A POPULAR lecture on “Atomic Disintegration” by Doctor Enrico Fermi, distinguished physicist and winner of the 1938 Nobel Prize in physics, will be one of the high lights of the Institute's forthcoming winter convention, to be held in New York, N. Y., January 22–26, 1940, with headquarters at the Engineering Societies building. Doctor Fermi's lecture will be delivered on Wednesday evening, January 24, in connection with the presentation of the Edison and Hoover Medals, and will be followed by demonstrations of atomic disintegration by Doctor John R. Dunning, professor of physics, Columbia University."

"AN INCREASE in the number of pages of technical papers and discussions in the monthly journal, ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, and in the 1939 annual bound volume of TRANSACTIONS — an increase in the rate of traveling expenses for delegates to Institute meetings and to the District conferences for which such allowances are granted (from 7½ € to 8½ € per mile one way) effective January 1, 1940 — the addition of one person to headquarters' staff to assist in the work of the standards and technical program committees — an initial payment of $5,000 to a pension fund reserve — are provided for in the budget of income and expenditures for the appropriation year beginning October 1, 1939, which the board of directors adopted at its meeting on October 27, 1939."

"The John Fritz Gold Medal for 1940 has been awarded posthumously to Doctor C. F. Hirshfeld (A'05, F'36), by unanimous vote of the board of award. He was under consideration for the medal at the time of his death, April 19, 1939. The award, the highest distinction bestowed jointly by the four national societies of civil, mining and metallurgical, mechanical, and electrical engineers, for notable scientific and industrial achievement, went to Doctor Hirshfeld \"for notable leadership through research and development in power generation and electric traction, and for being a great teacher and friend of men both old and young.\" Doctor Hirshfeld was chief of the department of research of the Detroit Edison Company, Detroit, Mich. A biographical sketch and obituary notice appeared in the May issue, page 229."
"At its 12th annual meeting, held November 2–4, 1939, at Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass., the National Research Council's conference on electrical insulation took on a new pilot-Ward F. Davidson (A'14, F'26) director of research for the Consolidated Edison Company of New York and chairman of the AIEE committee on research. Originally organized in 1928 as the NRC committee on electrical insulation, the conference with two exceptions has been operating continuously under the stimulating leadership of its retiring chairman, Doctor John B. Whitehead (A'OO, F'12) director of The Johns Hopkins University school of engineering. The exceptions noted were the period (1933–34) of Doctor Whitehead's presidency of the AIEE, and the last half of the current year. A serious illness in the Spring of 1939 and an off-expressed belief in the desirability of having “new blood,” caused Doctor Whitehead to insist upon the acceptance of his resignation from the chairmanship. During these interim periods, the responsibilities of leadership fell upon and were assumed by Vice-Chairman William A. Del Mar (A'06, F'20) chief engineer of the Habirshaw Cable and Wire Division of the Phelps Dodge Copper Products Corporation and long-time active participant in AIEE affairs."

"AN underground high-voltage cable system is made up of two major components: the cable with its joints and accessories and the underground duct and manhole structure. The question of what size of conductor should be chosen ground facilities already exist and when only a few additional feeders are being considered it might seem logical to make use of them. A study of the annual charges may show, however, in some cases, that it will be more economical to for a particular transmission feeder or as a general standard for distribution feeders has confronted every planning group. The voltage for the system is frequently limited to one or to relatively few different values already existing as a system standard, deviations from which would result in increased cost to obtain terminal facilities. Frequently some under-build additional new underground facilities rather than further to congest already existing structures."
"THE USE of the multianode metal-tank mercury-arc rectifier is well established in the transportation industry. At the present time there are approximately 500,000 kw of these rectifiers in operation on railway properties in America. The units vary in size from 500 to 3,000 kw and range from 500 to 3,000 volts direct current."
"THE basic principles of ultrahigh-speed reclosing of high-voltage transmission lines have been presented previously before the Institute.1 Although, as has been explained, the effects and phenomena behind these principles are generally known, there are still a number of unknown factors that have not been explored fully and the effects of which need be known to make a thorough and scientific application of these principles. Among these are further data on the effects of breaker time and elapsed time between clearing of the arc and the re-energization of the circuits on the deionization of the arc and the re-establishment of the insulation strength of the surrounding area; data on the probable extent of and total time elapsed, as well as time between intervals of multiple strokes; knowledge concerning the effects of the quantity and the type of load on the likelihood of restriking or the failure of lines to hold when re-energized by virtue of system drifting away from synchronism; and, finally, data on the dead time needed on phase to phase faults to prevent restriking."
"WHEN two interconnected power systems pull out of step the relative values of voltages and currents are such as to indicate a three-phase fault somewhere in the interconnection, which if in the zone of high-speed impedance or reactance relays will cause them to trip their associated oil circuit breakers. Although this phenomenon has been recognized for some time, and various blocking schemes suggested,3,4 it has been generally accepted that when high-speed relays are involved, carrier current or pilot wires giving simultaneous control of the relays at both ends of a protected section are required to discriminate between a fault and an out-of-step condition.2,7 This paper describes a scheme developed for an important tie circuit of the Gulf States Utilities Company, whereby out-of-step blocking and selective tripping are obtained with existing impedance relays and without the use of carrier current or pilot wires."
"Condenser bushings use paper to provide high dielectric and physical strength. The value of paper as an insulation is recognized by its accepted use as the insulating medium in cables, transformers, and other apparatus. It is also recognized that unlimited life is attained when proper protection is provided against external influences. Such protection is obtained by improved methods of winding the capacitors, treatment with oil impregnation, and surface varnish. Further protection is provided for outdoor bushings by sealing the condenser in a weather casing of porcelain with improved flexible caps and gaskets. Insulating oil or a plastic heavier than water is available for encasing the capacitor."
"FUNDAMENTALLY, the voltage-time characteristic of insulation suggests the extending of studies for fullerboard and transformer oil1,2 to other insulation materials. Porcelain is considered in this investigation since it is used extensively for line and substation insulation, in apparatus design as bushings,3 and for other insulation."
"The development of the type J 12-channel carrier telephone system for open-wire lines required an increase of nearly 5 to 1 in the transmission frequency range of the lines. In the provision of suitable line facilities a number of new problems were encountered with respect to attenuation, noise and cross talk. Methods for meeting these problems and the results obtained are described."
"Previous papers before the AIEE describe the development of a 12-channel type J carrier system. This paper discusses some of the practical problems encountered in extending the circuit capacity of existing open-wire lines by the use of this carrier system."

"Technology has made enormous contributions to modern society, but there still remain many attention-challenging aspects of its influence upon social development; some of these aspects are discussed here by this noted scientisteducator, who says that many future social developments can be realized only through better technical developments and better management. The type of management that is most likely to be successful in the long run will direct and inspire, but not too rigidly control."
"INSULATION co-ordination on oil-circuit-breaker designs makes desirable a knowledge of surge voltages required to break down insulating oils. Because of the lack of available data on this subject a series of tests using hemispherical electrodes has been under way during the past year at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. One reason for the absence of data of this type, according to R. W. Sorensen (A'07, F'19) professor of electrical engineering at that institution, has been the difficulty in providing a convenient lead-in bushing for making the necessary tests. This difficulty was overcome by making a test barrel in which the electrodes were mounted, with a lead-in bushing of insulating material having about the same dielectric constant as insulating oil. Professor Sorensen has made available the following brief description of the test barrel."
"The distinguishing feature of a professional course is, or should be, that it is built on the basic engineering sciences which must precede it, and the emphasis in the course should be on a most thorough analysis of these principles as applied to fundamental practical problems, in the opinion of this educator."
"A Midget Sun. A 1,000-watt mercury-vapor lamp, no bigger than a cigarette, with an intrinsic brilliancy about one-fifth of the sun's, is now available. The lamp itself is a capillary quartz tube containing electrodes, a drop of mercury, and a little argon gas for starting. The heat and pressure are such that water-cooling is necessary, so an outer tube is provided as a water jacket about the size of a shotgun cartridge. The light is much whiter than that of the well-known low-pressure mercury-vapor lamp. If the outer tube is made of quartz instead of hard glass, the lamp is a powerful source of ultraviolet radiation. The efficiency is about three times that of an incandescent lamp of corresponding wattage. Suggested uses are in projection, photographic processes, and therapy."
"Industry needs both the highly professional education that is prerequisite to the expectancy of further future development of new products and methods, and the more diversified preparation that is vital to operation and management. The united efforts of all engaged in engineering education are necessary if the best program is to be achieved."
"CONSTITUTING an electric locomotive with its own complete turbogenerating unit on board, the 5,000-horsepower steam-electric locomotive that has been under construction for nearly two years recently was completed at the Erie, Pa., works of the General Electric Company. Shown below attached to a test train, it will be subjected to a series of exhaustive operating tests before being placed in regular service. The locomotive is intended to haul passenger trains consisting of as many as 12 Pullman and standard passenger cars between Chicago and the Pacific Coast over 2.2-per cent grades without helper. It will be capable of speeds up to 125 miles per hour and continuous runs of from 500 to 700 miles. The locomotive is housed in two cabs, each containing: a complete 2,500-horsepower geared turbogenerator set; a high-pressure steam boiler; turbine-driven auxiliary set; and a finned-tube condenser cooled by turbine-driven fans. A low grade of oil, known as “bunker” oil, is used for fuel. Steam pressure and temperature are, respectively, 1,500 pounds per square inch and 920 degrees Fahrenheit. Complete automatic control is provided for boiler, auxiliaries, and power units. Twelve axle-hung geared motors drive the locomotive, six being supplied from each main generating unit. Speed is controlled by varying the field current of the main generators. Electric braking is employed."
"Continuing a series based on the annual report of the chairman of the Conference on Electrical Insulation of National Research Council, this article presents a summary of the principal research work on gaseous, liquid, and solid dielectrics during the past year. A comprehensive list of references is included."
"A PROGRAM comprised of some of the latest technical developments in many fields, yet not without social activities, has been arranged for the 1939 AIEE winter convention, which will be held in New York, N. Y., January 23–27, with headquarters in the Engineering Societies Building. Seventeen technical sessions, two general sessions, and seven technical conferences will be held during the mornings and afternoons, while in the evenings the smoker, Edison and John Fritz Medal presentations, and a dinner-dance will be held. In addition, a committee under the chairmanship of Mrs. A. F. Dixon is making arrangements for the entertainment of the women guests and the inspection trips committee will make arrangements to visit interesting places. As in the past, a post-convention cruise to Bermuda may be taken."
"UNDOUBTEDLY the “farthest south” of the general meetings of the Institute was the Southern District meeting held in Miami, Fla., November 28–30, 1938. Headquarters were at the Miami Biltmore Hotel, Coral Gables, where the facilities that were provided comfortably accommodated all technical sessions and major entertainment features. This was the third meeting to be held by the Southern District since District meetings were inaugurated in 1924. Average attendance at the five sessions, including the student sessions was in excess of 100. Other attendance details may be noted in the accompanying tabulations."
"A meeting of the executive committee of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers was held at Institute headquarters, New York, N. Y., on December 16, 1938, in place of the regular meeting of the board of directors."
"W.A. Kock of the Baldwin Piano Company, Cincinnati, Ohio, has been named by Eta Kappa Nu, honorary electrical engineering society, as the outstanding young electrical engineer for 1938. Mr. Kock was chosen from over 40 candidates nominated from every section of the United States by heads of college electrical-engineering departments and Sections of the AIEE. He becomes the third man to receive this honor. Two honorable-mention awards have also been announced for 1938, to be given to H. E. Gove (A'31) of the Union Electric Company of Missouri, St. Louis, and G. M. L. Sommerman (A'31, M'37) of the American Steel and Wire Company, Worcester, Mass."

"Marking the 20th year of the American Standards Association activities as national clearing house for the standardization work of American industry, the annual meeting of the association was held at New York, N. Y., November 30, 1938. D. D. Barnum, retiring president of the association, welcomed six trade groups that have become members during the past year, and emphasized the international work in which the association is taking part. He also cabled attention to the 14 active projects in the building field, to the beginnings of work for the prevention of occupational diseases, and to the newly organized highway-traffic standards committee which is bringing together 17 national organizations and government groups interested in safety standards for traffic."
"More than 50 electrical engineers from Mansfield, Galion, and Ashland, Ohio, met December 5 to organize a Mansfield division of the Cleveland Section, to establish the objectives of the division, to settle organizational details, and to elect officers for the current term."
"IN HIS annual report to the Conference on Electrical Insulation of National Research Council, presented at the eleventh annual meeting of the conference held recently in Pittsburgh, Pa., Chairman J. B. Whitehead (A'OO, F'12) said that during the past year: “There have been perhaps fewer noteworthy developments in applications of new knowledge to the problems of insulation. However, basic research in the field of chemistry and physics has continued its attack upon the problems of atomic structure and molecular assemblage.” (Full text of Doctor Whitehead's report appears elsewhere in this issue.) This trend toward fundamentals was reflected also in the 22 papers presented and discussed at the Pittsburgh meeting. Brief abstracts of these papers are given on this and following pages."

"Some 200 industrialists, heads of research departments, patent lawyers, and engineers engaged in a spirited discussion of “Invention and the Engineers' Relation to It” at the second forum of American Engineering Council, held in Detroit, Mich., November 11, 1938. The forum, in subject and in time, was scheduled so that the viewpoint of the engineering and allied professions might be expressed with regard to invention as a contribution to the hearings held in Washington during December, under the direction of the so-called Temporary National Economic Committee, sometimes called in brief the “Monopoly Committee.” It may be recalled that Senator O'Mahoney the chairman of this committee, made a vigorous plea for the Federal incorporation of business enterprise, at the annual meeting of AEC in Washington in January 1938."

The Institute assumes no responsibility for statements made in the following outlines, information for which is taken from the preface of the book in question."
"THERE has been evident need for some time for a general review of the factors influencing the application of capacitance potential devices. This need has been accentuated by the increasing use of bushing potential devices and the extension of the field of application made possible by the introduction of the coupling-capacitor potential device."
"FUSES may be used on large central station and industrial systems in locations where a high interrupting capacity is required. The conventional fuse may clear a short circuit in a half cycle or several cycles. Associated apparatus is subjected to electromagnetic forces produced by the high momentary currents. Good engineering practice dictates that all disconnecting switches, contactors, motor starters, etc., shall have short-time current ratings at least equal to the initial root-mean-square fault current which the system is capable of producing at the point of installation. Where these currents are extremely high, a saving in size and expense of such apparatus can be effected if the required short-time current rating can be reduced. Many attempts have been made and accomplishment has been achieved by the use of a fuse which consistently limits the initial peak current to a fraction of that available in the circuit. The purpose of this paper is to describe the new fuse."
"THE dominating position of the lightning surge as the principal scourge of transmission lines has occupied so much attention in the technical literature that traveling waves developed from other causes have been relegated to a zone of comparative unimportance. But lately, a growing interest and curiosity concerning switching surges makes it imperative to investigate, theoretically, the possibility of initiating traveling waves from the steady state; for both the “energizing” and “de-energizing” transients associated with switching operations are calculable as traveling waves and their successive reflections. The object of this paper, therefore, is to lay the groundwork for a systematic treatment of switching surges by considering the general subject of the initiation of traveling waves from steady-state conditions. In general, such waves are started either by closing or opening a switch; and the corresponding transients may be called closing transients and opening transients, respectively. If a “dead” line is connected to a generator, the ensuing transient is called an energizing surge, while if a “live” line is disconnected from a generator the transient is called a de-energizing surge."
"TERMINAL bushings for high-voltage power transformers require many electrical tests to demonstrate their fitness for service. A vital part of the complete transformer, they operate under extreme variations of temperature and weather conditions. They are subject to all the variations in load, ambient temperature, and surges that the transformer windings receive, and in addition must be built to withstand severe attacks of ice and snow, rain and hail, hot sun, smoke, fog, dust, and dirt. They must be stronger against flashover than the protective apparatus, and must maintain their strength year in and year out. The terminal bushing is a part of the transformer and not an individual piece of apparatus; under normal service conditions it should be proportioned in strength to the winding, and should be co-ordinated with the winding under impulse voltage conditions."

"Civilization grows as a consequence or community contacts among human beings, which contacts are largely made possible by engineering. The relation of engineering to society and social adjustment is one of inseparability, and although much progress has been made through historic time in the improvement of living conditions, further opportunities for improvement are outlined in this article by a noted engineer."

"Fluorescent Industrial Lamp. Out of the laboratory has come a new, highly efficient 100-watt lamp for industrial lighting. Like the well-known long-tube Cooper-Hewitt lamp, the new lamp is a four-foot tube containing a low-pressure mercury-vapor arc; but the new feature is a fluorescent coating on the inside wall of the tube, which converts the ultraviolet radiations of the arc into light. The efficiency is 50 lumens per watt, about three times that of the corresponding incandescent lamp."
"Certain conditions and trends relating to incentive and security are discussed in this article, which suggests that consideration should be given to various possibilities of stimulating interest toward higher standards of living as well as security."
"Electrical manufacturing offers many opportunities for the engineering graduate. Broad, intensive fundamental training rather than specialization is required, because co-ordination of knowledge from various branches of engineering is required. The scope of positions in the industry, ranging from technical to nontechnical by successive steps from research to sales and advertising, is outlined in this article."
"Actions have been taken recently by international bodies toward adoption in 1940 of new absolute unit standards for electrical quantities. A brief outline of the development of international standards and of the significance of the change are given in this article by an outstanding authority long active in this field."
"Society often has decreed regulations and restrictions that hamper management and private enterprise; but society is the sole arbitrator of what it considers right, and management must conform, says this chairman of the board of a leading electrical manufacturing company. He emphasizes the vital importance of private enterprise in modern life and the dependence of successful private enterprise upon good management."

"The governing bodies of Columbia University have placed at the disposal of the AIEE each year a scholarship in electrical engineering in the school of engineering of Columbia University for each class. The scholarship pays the annual tuition fees of $380. Reappointment of the student to the scholarship for the completion of his course is conditioned upon the maintenance of a good standing in his work."
"ELECTRIFICATION of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge railway, involving different voltages, offered many engineering problems in its design and construction. The project will be one of the high spots to be seen during the combined AIEE summer and Pacific Coast convention at San Francisco, Cal., June 26–30, 1939. As electrical engineers on the Pacific Coast are particularly concerned with the utilization and maintenance of electrical equipment, a well-rounded program of particular appeal to the engineer in industrial and commercial fields is under preparation."

"THE early departments of electrical engineering in American universities were outgrowths of courses developed in physics. In most engineering colleges some member of the physics faculty offered application courses in physics for engineering students and after a few years these developed into a complete curriculum with a separate faculty for electrical engineering in parallel with the older civil and mechanical engineering curricula."
"NO DEFENSIVE arguments are required to justify the need and desirability of co-ordination between mathematics, physics, and electrical-engineering subjects; such co-ordination must exist to some degree in every electrical-engineering curriculum and the essential objective of this symposium is to create a discussion of views and to reveal the instrumentalities whereby such co-ordination may be and is achieved."
"MANY definitions are given of an engineer. For the purpose of this discussion I would define an engineer as a scientist who uses physics and mathematics to promote the welfare of mankind. His use of physics and mathematics presupposes a thorough knowledge of them and demands that he be capable of:"
"IN RECENT years engineers and teachers have recognized1,2 that many graduates lack facility in the use of mathematics and physics in the solution of engineering problems. Appearing to know the principles of science that underlie engineering, the young graduates frequently cannot apply them correctly in new situations. It is evident that the development of the requisite facility depends upon first, mastery of the basic sciences and second, adequate training in their application. Thus, there is need for two different kinds of co-ordination of mathematics and physics with electrical engineering: co-ordination of the departmental teaching activities for most effective instruction, and co-ordination of the subject matter in the student's mind for most effective use."
"IN RECENT years all branches of engineering have experienced rapid growth and progress. Technological advancement has been accompanied by an increasing realization of the breadth and scope of the profession. College curricula have been altered and adjusted in attempts to meet changing conditions. We have been forced to realize that the solution of our educational problems is not to be found in an increased amount of work or in adding further courses to already overcrowded curricula, but rather in more complete co-ordination and unification within the programs themselves. Due to the manner in which the engineering curricula have been built up through the years, new subjects being added from time to time as was found necessary, we are in danger of thinking of a curriculum as being composed of separate blocks, i.e., so much mathematics, so much physics, chemistry, and so forth. Our problem is to break down the well-defined boundaries of these blocks so that they will be combined to form a unified and coherent whole. We might compare the curriculum to a painting for which the artist carefully chooses a number of colors which are not used separately in blocks, but are harmoniously blended and intermingled in a complete picture."
"It has been known for some time that an induction machine whose rotor is driven mechanically may become self-excited if capacitors are connected across its terminals. The present paper is concerned with the predetermination of the machine characteristics when operating under such conditions. The frequency of excitation is very close to the synchronous frequency corresponding to the speed of the rotor. The voltage to which the machine will excite is dependent upon its no-load excitation characteristics at that frequency, the criterion to be satisfied being that the lagging volt-amperes of excitation equal the leading volt-amperes of the capacitors."
"THE methods most often used for the measurement of d-c, a-c, and transient magnetic fields depend upon one fundamental law: that a voltage is generated in a conductor cutting lines of magnetic flux. However, for each of these fields the apparatus and procedure are entirely different. Perhaps the greatest difficulty arises in the study of a magnetic field under transient conditions, since the resulting voltage oscillogram is a composite of several components having more or less intricate phase relations. Thus the actual magnetic-field values or changes are rather difficult to obtain. A single instrument, adapted for use in any of the three fields, would be very desirable. With this object in view, the following report describes the work done in attempting to use, for the measurement of a-c and transient magnetic fields, an instrument previously proposed for use only in the d-c field."
"It is found that (10-cycle polarity characteristics correlate with the positive and negative impulse calibration curves for grounded sphere gaps sufficiently well to use them for determining the polarity limits for sphere gaps. The available data show that the maximum spacing at which a grounded sphere gap has equal positive and negative spark-over is a linear function of the size of the spheres. From this relation, it follows that the maximum sparking distance for equal positive and negative sparkover, expressed as a per cent of the diameter of the spheres, is not constant for all sphere diameters. Therefore, arbitrary polarity limits expressed in terms of the diameter of the sphere cannot apply to all sizes of sphere gaps."
"This paper describes a family of devices which automatically respond to signals and control the circuit amplification in such a way as to improve transmission. Their general characteristics are outlined, their differences explained, and some of their applications are listed."
"FOR some time, information dealing with the testing and application of lightning arresters has been needed. The two memoranda presented herein entitled “General Guide for Utilities on Methods of Testing Lightning Arresters” and “Factors Affecting Application of Arresters” have been prepared by the lightning arrester subcommittee of the AIEE protective devices committee and provide such information."
"RETARDATION tests have been used by industry for a long time. They have found their main applications in the determination of certain machine losses, usually friction and windage and core loss. The machines to which these methods have been applied have ordinarily had large mass and low rotational losses with the result that a considerable time would elapse between the time the power was shut off and the time the machine would come to rest. By proper selection of equipment and analysis the same methods may be applied to much smaller machines having relatively short stopping periods. In the present instance the methods have been applied to two double squirrel-cage induction motors, one a 7 1/2-horsepower 6-pole machine, and the other a 5-horsepower 4-pole machine. In each case the inertia was increased to about twice that of the motor alone by the use of a small flywheel. A similar analysis has been applied to acceleration tests on these two motors in which the motors were started at reduced voltage. By combining the acceleration tests with the decleration tests the speed-torque curves of the motors have been obtained. It is hoped that the discussion of the difficulties and the results of these tests will help to indicate the value and limitations of the methods as applied to similar determinations in this and other fields."
"AS is generally recognized, electrical energy is a commodity, the sale of which should be subject to the same economic laws that apply to other commodities. The two most important economic laws which regulate the sale price are (1) the law of diminishing costs, and (2) the law of supply and demand."
"DURING the last ten years there has been a considerable development of water power resources in this country. Many different organizations have participated in the design of these projects, and many contributions have been made to reduce the first cost, improve the overall efficiency, and reduce the cost of operation. A brief review of those trends which represent the greatest changes, or have provoked the most discussion, may be of interest at this time. On many of them there is no unanimity of opinion. The reader may disagree with some, he may even question whether others represent general trends at all; nevertheless, the writer will try to give them without either commendation or condemnation, and he would not be entirely candid if he did not say that some looked rather foolish to him at first. It should be emphasized that this paper will discuss only those features which have been changing, or have provoked discussion; many things which are of much greater importance to the station may therefore be mentioned only briefly, if at all."

"With a wind velocity as high as 186 miles per hour, and traveling forward as fast as 65 miles per hour, the hurricane that devastated parts of Long Island and New England on September 21, 1938, was the first storm of its character to afflict this territory in more than a century. The storm originated at least ten days prior to that time in the Caribbean Sea and was expected to strike the city of Miami, Fla., but turned north instead; later, it veered unexpectedly to the west as it progressed northward, gaining in intensity and momentum, and with unpredictable fury swept across a territory where a hurricane of any sort is a rarity. The story of the terrible destruction and loss of life left in its wake already has been told, as has been the story of the tremendous damage to the various public-utility systems and the added suffering resulting from the temporary loss of these services. With a view to determining what if any engineering conclusions might be drawn from the experiences following the hurricane that might be of value in the future, one of the two general sessions of the AIEE 1939 winter convention was devoted to a presentation and discussion of six addresses on this subject. The following six articles embrace the essential substance of those six addresses."
"THE railroad appurtenances chiefly affected by the storms were: tracks, bridges, passenger and freight station buildings, signals, electric power generating, transmission, and distribution facilities, communication lines, and miscellaneous motors, such as shop, pump, floatbridge and track-switch motors, and drawbridge motors and control circuits. Various types of buildings, boats of all sizes, including a large lighthouse tender which required 17 days to remove, and other debris of all kinds deposited on the tracks, contributed relatively minor but still important problems in restoration of service. Busy passenger stations, such as that at Providence, R. I., and at New London, Conn., having been inundated, were without lights for a time. The railroad organizations thus lacked nothing of variety in re-establishing service."
"THE Long Island Lighting Company system extends from the Rockaway beaches to Orient and Montauk points on the eastern end of the island, although the main part of our territory is, of course, outside of the city of New York. This territory is a little more than 100 miles long and at right angles to the path of the storm, with a maximum width of about 25 miles and a population in the whole area of something less than 700,000 people. The system has three main generating stations, one at Far Rockaway on Jamaica Bay, one at Northport on the north shore of Long Island in Suffolk County, and our principal station at Glenwood Landing which is also on the north shore in Hempstead Harbor. These stations feed into two 66-kv circuits on steel towers running down the backbone of Long Island. The hurricane of September covered this whole area and disrupted the service in varying degrees and intensities in practically all of it. Although the wind velocities reached as high as 100 miles per hour, the damage to transmission and distribution lines was caused almost entirely by trees falling against the poles or across the lines, except in some cases where the poles were set in soil which became really drifting sand due to the high water."
"EXCLUSIVE of the Cos Cob station (referred to in article II of this series) there are five steam generating stations along the Connecticut coast owned by three different operating companies. These stations are at Montville, New Haven, Bridgeport, Devon, and Stamford. As a result of the storm wave, the Montville and Stamford stations suffered outages because of flooded essential auxiliary equipment. New Haven and Bridgeport stations did not shut down, but did have a few non-essential motors flooded. At Devon, earth barricades excluded water from the station."
"THE PATH of the hurricane disturbance over New England embraced the entire system of the Boston Edison Company. The wind velocity of the hurricane at the Blue Hill Observatory near Boston situated 500 feet above sea level approximated 186 miles per hour at 6:47 p.m. on the day of the storm and several sustained gusts of 111 miles per hour were recorded over five-minute periods. In general, the maximum wind velocity at the ground throughout our area was estimated to have been in the vicinity of 85 to 100 miles per hour. There was almost no rain in Boston although rain elsewhere resulted in extensive floods."
"EXPERIENCES of the telephone companies are naturally much the same as those already described. The aftermath tally showed that more than one-half million telephones were put out of service — in the New England States about 30 per cent of the telephones in that area. Through the destruction of toll lines, the storm temporarily cut off telephone communication with the outside from over 200 towns. The total damage to telephone plant was in the neighborhood of ten million dollars."
"Remarks made by President Parker at a general session of the recent AIEE winter convention on the subject of the social and political relations of professional bodies are presented here."
"The qualifications of the 1939 recipient of the highest American engineering honor are those of a leader, a statesman, and a nobleman of science."
"Conditioned Reflex and Traffic Lights. When through experience a new stimulus becomes effective to produce automatic response, the neural mechanism producing it is called a conditioned reflex. Pavlov produced conditioned reflexes in dogs by associating for them the ringing of a bell or tapping on the skin with immediately thereafter receiving food. After such conditioning of reflexes, the bell or the tapping would suffice in itself to produce a flow of saliva. In driving an automobile, the shift of the right foot from accelerator pedal to brake pedal, or vice versa, as traffic conditions call for deceleration or acceleration, becomes almost automatic and largely unconscious. The introduction of traffic lights created a new stimulus to that response and thus a conditioned reflex."
"Questioning the value and adequacy of postgraduate engineering courses as commonly conducted, this article tosses a verbal bombshell into the laps of educators. A symposium of solicited comments reflecting the opinions of representative industrialists and engineering educators is scheduled for presentation in the next issue; other brief comments are invited."
"WITH a technical program enlarged to include 17 sessions, at which 82 technical papers were presented, two general sessions, and five technical conferences, the AIEE 1939 winter convention held in New York, N. Y., January 23–27, closed with a total registered attendance of 1,610 — the highest since 1924. This enlarged program, together with the careful planning and execution of the program as a whole on the part of the hard-working winter-convention committee, is believed to be largely responsible for the increased attendance. More detailed statistics on registration and attendance are given in accompanying tabulations. Included on the program were the usual entertainment features and inspection trips. A special evening program was devoted to presentation of the Edison and John Fritz medals to Past Presidents D. C. Jackson and F. B. Jewett, respectively."

"A complete official ticket of candidates for the Institute offices that will become vacant August 1, 1939, was selected by the national nominating committee at its meeting held at Institute headquarters, New York, N. Y., January 23, 1939. This committee, in accordance with the constitution and bylaws, consists of 15 members, one selected by the executive committee of each of the ten geographical Districts, and five selected by the board of directors from its own membership."
"THE AIEE South West District meeting will be held in Houston, Tex., April 17–19, 1939. Headquarters for the meeting will be in the Rice Hotel. The program is complete with technical sessions on varied subjects of particular interest to the Southwest, three student sessions, and attractive entertainment features."
"Plans for the AIEE North Eastern District meeting to be held at the Hotel Kimball, Springfield, Mass., May 3–5, 1939, are now approaching the final stages."
"The AIEE San Diego Section, authorized by the AIEE board of directors in December 1938, held its organization meeting in San Diego, Calif., January 18, 1939. Seventeen members and two guests attended this first meeting of the Institute's 66th Section, whose territory consists of San Diego and Imperial counties."
"The regular meeting of the board of directors of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers was held at Institute headquarters, New York, N. Y., on January 24, 1939."
"The patent inquiry now underway with funds provided by the National Industrial Conference Board, and under the direction of the AEC patents committee, directs attention to one of the primary opportunities for united action of engineers on public questions. A seven-page summary of these several fact-finding projects of the American Engineering Council is available on request."
"The board of examiners, at its recent meeting recommended the members listed for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objection to these transfers should be filed at once with the national secretary."
"Among the new books received at the Engineering Societies Library, New York, recently are the following which have been selected because of their possible interest to the electrical engineer. Unless otherwise specified, books listed have been presented gratis by the publishers. The institute assumes no responsibility for statements made in the following outlines, information for which is taken from the preface of the book in question."
"This paper describes an application of a new method of automatic control between two interconnected power systems, whereby greater utilization of the interconnection capacity is secured. As the stable limit of the interchange between systems is affected by variations in the magnitude and location of intermediate loads on the respective systems, direct control of the phase angle between systems recognizes such variations and permits a flexible and more stable type of operation including, when desired, maximum transfers of energy. An indication of the 60-cycle voltage from a desired point on one system is continuously transmitted by means of carrier current, to a point on the second system where its phase position is compared with that of the 60-cycle voltage at the receiving point. The output of generating units at the control station is automatically regulated to maintain the phase angle between systems at desired values or within predetermined limits."
"THIS paper presents an analysis of the determination of static power limits of power systems and offers an accurate method considering resistance, shunt loads, saliency, and saturation. The conventional methods of determining the static power limits of systems composed of synchronous machines and shunt loads based on unsaturated cylindricalrotor theory give only approximate results. It is fortunate that the actual maximum power transfer is generally larger than the calculated value obtained from the customary analysis. Machine saturation and saliency increase the power limit, the difference decreasing with increased system impedance. The validity of the method is shown by the check between experimental values obtained from three small machines and theoretical curves. It was found that errors due to neglecting saturation are more significant than those due to neglecting saliency."
"Since the development of the copper-oxide rectifier in 1927, no paper has presented to the Institute a comprehensive list of the many problems to which the device may be applied successfully. It is the purpose of this paper to describe a few of the representative installations made in the various industries."
"RECENTLY three Petersen coils were installed on the 66-kv transmission system of the Metropolitan Edison Company of Pennsylvania. These Petersen coils provide service protection to approximately 320 miles of overhead transmission lines against outages and voltage dips which would otherwise result when single phase-to-ground flashovers occur on the system. Much of the 66-kv transmission system consists of two-circuit lines with vertical configurations of the line conductors with no transpositions prior to the Petersen-coil installation."
"This paper describes the power features of the aqueduct being built to supplement the water supply of Southern California. Three hundred thousand kilowatts of power ultimately will be transmitted from Boulder Dam to operate 45 synchronous motors driving centrifugal pumps. High efficiency, long life, and simplicity of design are given precedence over close voltage regulation and the elimination of momentary interruptions."
"A method of transmission and reproduction of line images is described which utilizes a cathode-ray tube for reproduction, the spot of which is made to trace out the line image 20 or more times a second. In an experimental test, a drawing of a woman's head was reproduced with an equivalent total band width of approximately 2,600 cycles. This was made up of two bands, each 1,300 cycles wide for the potentials to the two sets of cathode-ray deflector plates. Analysis of a more complex image, such as that of an animated cartoon shows that such material could be transmitted and reproduced by this method within a total band width of 10,000 cycles. Means are described for transcribing from drawing or animated cartoon film into recordings (similar to sound recordings) from which the potentials for transmission and subsequent operation of the cathode-ray tube may be obtained."
"RECENTLY a number of articles dealing with the critical conditions in ferroresonant circuits has appeared. However, no simple generalization is possible from these previous methods. The generalization presented in this paper offers certain information pertaining to similitudes of circuits in a surprisingly simple manner. Knowing the critical stable conditions for one reactor, the principle of similitude enables the predetermination of the critical stable conditions for any other reactor using the same grade of iron."

"TREASURE ISLAND is 400 acres of sand pumped out of San Francisco Bay; but those attending the combined summer and Pacific Coast Convention of the AIEE to be held in San Francisco, June 26–30, 1939, and other visitors to the Golden Gate International Exposition, will remember it as a scene of rare, colored beauty. Electricity will have been responsible for that. Electricity is what makes the San Francisco Fair different from those that have gone before. Treasure Island is a symbol of the progress that has been made in illumination in just a few short years."
"SAID a young applicant to the secretary of a state registration board: “I don't understand why your board refuses to grant me a license as a professional engineer. Your requirements are a diploma and four years of experience. I have a diploma and five years' experience, but you turn me down. Why is it?” The reply of the secretary opened the eyes of the applicant. “You have been doing routine work which has not added to your professional development,” he said, “your experience is not satisfactory to the board.”"
"ELECTRIC motors and other types of prime movers rotate at much higher speeds than do the majority of driven machines and therefore some means of speed reduction is necessary. One of the most important and most efficient of methods is gearing, which satisfies the fundamental requirements of compactness and high mechanical efficiency. With helical gears mounted on anti-friction bearings and running in oil, efficiencies of 98 per cent for single-reduction gear drives and 96 per cent for double-reduction drives may be attained. Initial cost is always important in the purchase of power-transmission equipment, and surveys indicate that in the majority of applications the gear transmissions can be purchased for a lower initial cost than can other types of drives. This is also true for slow-speed motors which would form an alternate for the high-speed motor and some form of speed reduction."
"IN 1937, at Milwaukee, I attempted an analysis of the organization of the engineering profession.∗ Here I wish to develop that theme somewhat and I intend to trace briefly the relationship of engineering to the other professions, the professional traditions which engineers inherit, and the outlook for the engineering profession in view of its unique relationship to society. I plan to review the history of professions very sketchily; but through this history runs a thread to which I wish especially to direct your attention."
"ON OCCASIONS like this it is expected that the medalist say something about his past which presumably he thinks may have borne on the award. Since the matters discussed by the committee of award around the council fire are never disclosed, this is a dangerous thing and one to be invited only by stoics. If the medalist chances to hit on things they have approved, they may be pleased but must wear the mask of vacancy. They must wear it also if he esteems things they consider of little or no merit. It is an irreversible process. I am going to avoid both Scylla and Charybdis by the simple process of crawling overland and dropping a few fragments of my history and philosophy."
"APPARENTLY the complexities of the standardization machinery in operation in the electrical field today is continually leading to misunderstandings, particularly among the members of the Institute uninitiated in standards rites. These erroneous beliefs vary all the way from one in which the Institute is pictured as having resigned all interest in standards work, to that where the AIEE is preparing again to take over full control. Both statements are far from the truth and might lead to unfortunate developments. An attempt therefore was made over a year ago through the publication of an article in Electrical Engineering (June 1937, page 653) to get a clear picture of the situation before the membership. With the same goal in view, this article is now being presented but from a slightly different viewpoint."
"THE CITATION that the Edison Medal committee has so graciously joined with my name couples engineering education with engineering practice. That never before has been done explicitly in an Edison Medal citation. Indeed the phrase “engineering education” never before has been used in such a citation. The use here seems to me significant of the present relation in the field of electrical engineering, where education and practice are now recognized as complementary parts of one whole; and it turns me to the theme of engineering education, to the exclusion (at this time) of directly discussing the science and art of electric-power practice which is the conjoined part of the citation."
"Questioning the value and adequacy of postgraduate engineering courses as commonly conducted, L.W.W. Morrow in an article in Electrical Engineering for March 1939, pages 118-122, called for a program of investigation of postgraduate training. Solicited comments of some representative industrialists and educators are presented here."
"FINAL DETAILS are being completed for the North Eastern District Meeting of the AIEE to be held at Springfield, Mass., May 3–5, 1939. Headquarters will be at the Hotel Kimball and arrangements have been made to house those attending in this hotel and other hotels in the city. Springfield, situated in the Connecticut River Valley, is the center of a growing and prosperous industrial area. An attractive program of entertainment, inspection trips, and technical sessions has been arranged by the District meeting committee under the chairmanship of W. O. Henschke."
"BY VIRTUE OF its location in San Francisco, Calif., the AIEE 1939 combined summer and Pacific Coast convention, to be held June 26–30, affords unusual opportunities to combine business and pleasure. The Golden Gate International Exposition, recently opened on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay, will be the principal “extra curricular” attraction. (An article describing electricity's part in the operation of the exposition appears elsewhere in this issue.) The San Francisco Bay area is noted for its many beautiful homes, fine golf courses, and natural attractions such as famed Muir Woods, a virgin grove of giant redwoods. Within a day's drive are many noted resort areas including Del Monte and the Monterey Peninsula, Santa Cruz, Yosemite Park, Lake Tahoe, and the Redwood Highway."

"Latest addition to the series of research monographs on alloys of iron is “The Alloys of Iron and Nickel: Volume I-Special-Purpose Alloys” by J. S. Marsh, physical metallurgist and associate editor, alloys of iron research, The Engineering foundation. Like its predecessors, it is published in New York, N. Y., by the McGraw-Hill Book Company for The Engineering foundation, which is a joint agency of the Founder Societies. This monograph is the tenth in a series of critical summaries of technical information on iron and its alloys, prepared under the supervision of the iron alloys committee of the Foundation. Although the AIEE is not officially represented on the committee, Wilfred Sykes (A'09, F'14) of the Inland Steel Company, Chicago, Ill., is a member-at-large."
"CONTRIBUTIONS to these columns are invited from Institute members and subscribers. They should be concise and may deal with technical papers, articles published in previous issues, or other subjects of some general interest and professional importance. Electrical Engineering will endeavor to publish as many letters as possible, but of necessity reserves the right to publish them in whole or in part, or reject them entirely."
"The board of examiners, at its meeting on March 16, 1939, recommended the following members for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objection to these transfers should be filed at once with the national secretary."
"Among the new books received at the Engineering Societies Library, New York, N. Y., recently are the following which have been selected because of their possible interest to the electrical engineer. Unless otherwise specified, books listed have been presented gratis by the publishers. The Institute assumes no responsibility for statements made in the following outlines, information for which is taken from the preface of the book in question."
"THE Boulder Dam transmission line of the Department of Water and Power of the City of Los Angeles, has been in service since October 1936. By virtue of the vagaries of climate, the line has been called upon to withstand lightning, wind, ice, and floods of unusual severity, subjecting the line to many of the extreme conditions for which it was designed, without having to wait the usual long term of years for such conditions to occur."
"THE original basis for the selection of 1.4 inches as the diameter of the conductor for the Boulder Dam transmission line was provided principally by test data taken at the Ryan High Voltage Laboratory, at Stanford University, by the Department of Water and Power in co-operation with Doctor Joseph S. Carroll, on conductors ranging from 1.125 inches to 2 inches in diameter.1 Also reference was made to other previous corona work at the same place.2,3,4 An analysis and use of the data,5,6 taking into account temperature and altitude effect and making some allowance for unknown factors affecting corona laws that had appeared in many of the tests, led to the final recommendation of 1.4 inches as the diameter for the conductor for 287.5 kv."
"THE Boulder Dam-Los Angeles transmission system of the Bureau of Power and Light traverses country presenting a wide variation in geological and climatological conditions. Starting from practically sea-level conditions at the Los Angeles terminus, the line passes through low-lying alluvial valleys, with their accompanying fogs, through the foothill sections and across the gravelly and rocky talus slopes at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains. Passing over Cajon Pass at an elevation of 4,415 feet, the line drops gradually into the Mojave Desert area for the remainder of the 190 miles to the Boulder power plant. For those unfamiliar with this territory, it is a mingling of mountain ranges, large sloping valleys of a generally rocky character with occasional sinks or dry lakes that are flooded at two-to four-year intervals by desert storms. In this section the line varies in elevation from 800 to 4,862 feet with the general trend being between 2,000 and 3,000 feet. The average rainfall in this territory is between one and six inches per year which usually comes in one or two storms of cloudburst proportions."
"CARRIER-CURRENT equipment is being employed for three distinct services on the Boulder Dam transmission line: first, for pilot channels for automatic protective line relays; second, for a transmission channel for supervisory control equipment which provides control from Boulder power plant of the two switching stations between Boulder and Los Angeles; and third, for telephone communication between Los Angeles, Boulder, and the two intermediate stations, and to transmit orders to line patrolmen who may be working at any point along the line. These three functions may be performed simultaneously without interference with each other, and are not affected by power conditions or normal switching conditions on the line."
"WHEN the study of these lines for the application of protective relays was started the predetermination of fault currents made it necessary to calculate all of the phase-sequence constants of the lines since none of these constants for conductors of this size and spacing was available."
"OVER thirty years ago work was done by Ryan1,2,4 and his student, Ekern,3 to determine the electrical strength of air at pressures of many atmospheres. It was discovered that the voltage required for sparking between points bears a roughly linear relation to the air pressure until the voltage has risen to approximately ten times that required for sparking between the same points, at the same spacing, at normal atmospheric pressure. A maximum voltage is reached at an air pressure of between 100 and 200 pounds per square inch. As the pressure is further raised, the sparking voltage does not rise correspondingly — in fact it drops somewhat if sharp points are used, and then at still higher pressure (above 400 pounds per square inch) the voltage rises slowly with pressure."
"FOR many years amortisseur, or damper windings, were included in water-wheel generators only when they were required to meet special conditions such as high starting torque for automatic station service, synchronous condenser operation, or system-stability requirements."
"THE use of insulating oil in electrical equipment carries with it the problem of prevention of deterioration when the oil is subjected to elevated temperatures in the presence of air. Deterioration may be accelerated by the presence of moisture and organic acid. This condition is found in certain types of transformers and oil-filled bushings."

"Large Cable Order to Phelps-Dodge. — An order has been received from the municipal electric light plant at Jacksonville, Fla., by the Phelps-Dodge Products Corp., New York City, for 133,000 feet of lead covered, paper-insulated cable of 3-conductor design and 750,000 circular mils. The cable is rated for operation at 21,000 volts and is to be installed underground in four parallel circuits, providing a capacity of about 100,000 kw. The cost of the cable is approximately $450,000. The Scofield Engineering Co., of Philadelphia, were the consulting engineers in the extension development of the Jacksonville power system."

"The test of any form of social organization is the opportunities it creates for the release and development of human energies, declares this economist. On that basis he contrasts the principle of “enterprise,” as it has operated in the United States for 150 years, with the older principle of “authority,” and predicts the outcome of the struggle between them."

"REGULAR facsimile broadcasts of a morning newspaper to 100 subscribers now are being made by the McClatchy newspapers in Sacramento and Fresno, Calif. The service, which began February 2, 1939, uses standard broadcast frequency bands to transmit signals and synchronizes senders and receivers through the interconnected facilities of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company. While experiments with the equipment have been under way for several years, this is the largest regular service yet attempted and the first use of facsimile network broadcasting."
"NO engineer can contemplate the whole field of his profession without the thrill of recognizing the leadership of science — the new knowledge which is remaking the physical world. But most of the achievements of science require the services of the engineer, whose care it is to translate facts into physical form for the use of society."

"THE combined AIEE summer and Pacific Coast convention, which will be held in San Francisco, Calif., June 26–30, 1939, offers members and guests unusual opportunities to combine business and pleasure. The technical program will include outstanding papers on a variety of pertinent subjects, round-table conferences, student meetings, and related activities. Entertainment will feature the Golden Gate International Exposition, which has designated Tuesday, June 27, as AIEE Day. Sports and entertainment have been arranged and extensive plans have been made to entertain the women guests."
"THE conference on sound measurement held during the AIEE 1939 winter convention, under sponsorship of the subcommittee on sound of the AIEE standards committee, attracted widespread interest; the discussion was participated in by some 20 speakers, and the total attendance was well over 100. This summary report of the conference was prepared by P. L. Alger, chairman of the subcommittee."
"The fourth in the series of published indexes to technical papers and discussions published in the AIEE TRANSACTIONS is now off the press and ready for distribution. Covering the years 1922–38, inclusive, the volume contains 160 pages and its over-all dimensions and type of binding are similar to those of recent TRANSACTIONS volumes."
"AIEE Student Branch recognition of the approaching 75th birthday of Doctor C. F. Scott (A'92, F'25. HM'29) began with a dinner and meeting given in Doctor Scott's honor by the Yale University Branch, New Haven, Conn., March 17, 1939. Doctor Scott, who inaugurated Student Branches during his presidency of the AIEE 1902–03, was head of the department of electrical engineering at Yale for 22 years, and himself founded the Yale Branch. Yale therefore arranged to be the first of the Student Branches to commemorate the “diamond jubilee” of their founder, acting upon the suggestion made last year by R. W. Sorensen, chairman, committee on Student Branches."
"In accordance with the provisions of the Institute's 1938–39 budget as approved by the finance committee and the board of directors, the 1939 edition of the AIEE Year Book has been issued, in limited edition, and is available to members of the Institute who have use for it. The book contains essentially the same material as was included in the 1938 edition; business and mailing addresses have been corrected as of February 28, 1939."
"The Mansfield (Ohio) division of the AIEE Cleveland Section which was formed in December 1938 (EE, Jan.

"IT IS the purpose of this paper to describe briefly the crossbar dial-telephone central-office switching system which has recently been developed by the Bell System for use in large cities. Sixteen years ago, in February 1923, a paper was read before the Institute, by E. B. Craft, L. F. Morehouse, and H. P. Charlesworth of the Bell System, which outlined the history and the problems involved in telephone central-office switching and described the panel dial central-office system which had just been developed and was being introduced in the large cities. The first central office of this type was placed in service in December 1921, and since that time 456 panel dial offices serving nearly 4 1/2 million subscriber stations have been installed in 26 different cities throughout the country. During these years many improvements have been made in the panel system to make it more serviceable to the telephone public and to meet the new problems which have arisen, but in addition, the engineers of the Bell System have continued their search to find new and better means for meeting telephone switching demands. This work has resulted in the adoption of the crossbar-type central-office switching equipment. Two offices of this type were placed in successful operation during 1938 and others are in process of manufacture and installation."
"THE superior dielectric strength of compressed gases, their low dielectric loss, their low dielectric constant, their low cost, and the fact that they are self-healing make them very promising insulating media. Compressed-gas insulation has been used in precision condensers where low dielectric loss is essential; it has been tried in other types of equipment such as transformers; it has been suggested for electric power cables where the low dielectric constant is of considerable importance; and recently it has found interesting and important application in the production of very high voltages by electrostatic means for use in X ray and nuclear physics work."
"THE RECENT occurrence of several serious switch-house fires has occasioned an unusual interest in the matter of bus protection. Acting upon the belief that a comprehensive survey of modern practices in such protection would be of some benefit to those interested, the relay subcommittee of the AIEE protective devices committee and the relay subject committee of the Edison Electric Institute electrical equipment committee jointly prepared and circulated a rather extensive questionnaire on the subject."
"IN June 1938, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad placed in operation six new 3,600-horsepower a-c d-c passenger locomotives of the same general type as the ten 2,800-horsepower engines which were put in service in 1931, but incorporating numerous improved features to give considerably increased performance to meet the more exacting demands of modern high-speed transportation."
"PROGRESS is evident to an unusual degree in the fabric-processing operations at the new automobile-tire plant of the Ford Motor Company.∗ The fabrics and rubbers which are run through these operations to form the rubber-fabric structures used in building the automobile tire pass through processes and machinery which clearly reflect the continuous production idea developed by the automobile industry. The electrical equipment in this plant introduces ideas which make the drives fundamentally different from those in general use."
"THE Permatron is a new gas-filled control tube in which the initiation of a discharge may be controlled by an externally applied magnetic field. The possibility of this type of control has been recognized during the past few years,1 but little attention has been paid to proper design or to the interesting applications of tubes built specifically for magnetic control. The present paper has been written as the result of research work which has shown that magnetic-control tubes are a reliable and useful addition to the field of electronics. The trademark “Permatron” has been chosen to indicate the use of magnetic control."
"Secondary capacitors cost more than primary capacitors but they offer some additional benefits which may offset the additional costs. There are presented herein the results of a comprehensive economic study covering a wide variety of circuit and load conditions on both network and radial distribution systems to establish within reasonable limits the probable field of application of the secondary capacitor."

"Each of the great American expositions has marked progressive advances in the field of artificial illumination. Chicago's Columbian Exposition of 1893 startled the world with its wide use of the then-novel incandescent lamp. In 1915 the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco eached new levels in the use of exterior floodlighting. Chicago's Century of Progress showed further advances, particularly in the field of color. But it is safe to say that the current expositions employ a wider variety of new illumints, equipments, and installations than all their predecesors combined. The Golden Gate International Exposition frnishes dramatic proof of such advances; and because the problems involved are applicable to all building design, description of its principal features seems worthwhile."

"I was sorry not to be able to go to England to receive this great honor directly from The Institution of Electrical Engineers. In some ways, however, it is not unfitting that I receive it through the kindly auspices of the AIEE, of which I have long been a member. Nor is it unfitting that I receive it in Springfield, Mass., for there are many factors connecting this locality with the event."
"WELDING has grown to be as important a tool in engineering in Europe as it is in the United States. Welding machines in Europe are of high quality and in most countries of a-c equipment is far more widely used than d-c equipment. Special attention has been directed to low-rating machines for thin-gauge welding with the consequence that very excellent a-c and rectifier type sets have been developed for this work."
"A STEAM generator no larger than an ordinary incandescent lamp has been developed by the lamp division of Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company. Heating coils of the device are directly immersed in water, providing a thermal efficiency of 90 per cent. It can generate superheated steam from cold water in less than 15 seconds. The heater is made in 1,000-, 1,500-, and 2,000-watt sizes, with evaporating capacities up to 5.7 pounds of water per hour. Steam can be superheated by it to 350 degrees Fahrenheit."
"A VERY successful three-day meeting and Student Branch convention of the South West District was held in Houston, Tex., April 17–19, with headquarters in the Rice Hotel. Over 500 members, guests, and students attended and took part in the various activities arranged by the committees, such as technical sessions, inspection trips, and social functions. The subject of oil-field operations was treated by papers presented in three of the nine technical sessions. One of the high spots of the meeting was a talk on “Geophysical Prospecting,” by L. W.

"THE PROBLEM of bus differential protection is receiving increased attention by relay engineers because of the serious consequences of a bus fault. Several cases of bus faults have recently occurred indicating that regardless of care used in the design of structures, some unexpected failure or accident may cause a disastrous outage. In spite of the many improvements that have been made in the protection of transmission lines in recent years, little attention has been given to the protection of station busses. This has been due partly to the impression that they were not particularly subject to faults and partly to the feeling that the protective relays would do more harm than good through incorrect tripping. Recent experiences, however, indicate that a bus fault, though of infrequent occurrence, can cause much greater damage and a longer outage period than many transmission line faults. Also, high-grade performance has been obtained when a bus protective scheme is properly installed with due consideration given to the many factors which might lead to faulty operation. The purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the important factors to be considered in bus differential protection and the operating characteristics and results of a field test on a new bus differential relay."
"Copper-oxide modulators are widely used in telephone systems for translating either single speech channels or groups of speech channels to carrier-frequency locations on the lines. A number of simple circuit arrangements have been developed that enable suppression of certain undesired frequencies to a degree that is impractical in tube modulators. These modulators transmit equally well in either direction and the modulating elements are more nonlinear than in tube modulators. As a result numerous effects are found that ordinarily are not important in the tube arrangements. Analytical studies have been considerably simplified by the use of a small signal, and a large carrier controlling the impedance variation of the copper oxide. It is found in this case that the superposition and reciprocity theorems hold for all the circuits that it has been possible to analyze even though the modulator is made up of nonlinear elements. Open and short-circuit impedance measurements can be made use of as in four-terminal linear networks, and a generalized reflection theory developed. Performance data are given for an idealized modulator under a variety of operating conditions."
"When the railroads began air conditioning their trains, adequate charging of the storage batteries associated with air conditioning systems became an important factor in the new development. The capacity of the axle driven d-c generator charger was increased; however, supplementary charging was frequently necessary or desirable, particularly when the axle generators were not operating. The railroads met this problem by using portable motor generator sets, wiring their stations and yards with standby service and through the use of small, compact, dry-disk rectifier battery chargers of sufficient current capacities to charge one or two car batteries simultaneously. The first rectifier developed for this service made use of the magnesium-copper sulphide dry-disk type. The mechanism of this rectifier is here briefly discussed, design features enumerated, and the type of rectifier battery chargers developed for railroad use described."
"THE completion and placing into service of the Pennsylvania Railroad electrification marks the satisfactory conclusion of a relay design and application problem involving considerable pioneering work in this field. The protection problem is the provision of a system of protective relays, which in event of trouble, will automatically open circuit breakers to isolate the faulty section from the remainder of the power system. Outstanding features of the protective system are:"

"This paper gives the enumeration of impedances measurable at the n terminals of a linear passive network. The enumeration supplies background for the study of network representations and the numerical results which are given up to ten terminals are perhaps surprising in the rapidity of the rise of the number of impedances with the number of terminals; almost 126,000,000 impedances, e.g., are measurable for ten terminals."
"Copper oxide modulators are widely used in telephone systems for translating either single speech channels or groups of speech channels to carrier frequency locations on the lines. A number of simple circuit arrangements have been developed that enable suppression of certain undesired frequencies to a degree that is impractical in tube modulators. These modulators transmit equally well in either direction and the modulating elements are more nonlinear than in tube modulators. As a result numerous effects are found that ordinarily are not important in the tube arrangements. Analytical studies have been considerably simplified by the use of a small signal, and a large carrier controlling the impedance variation of the copper oxide. It is found in this case that the superposition and reciprocity theorems hold for all the circuits that it has been possible to analyze even though the modulator is made up of nonlinear elements. Open and short-circuit impedance measurements can be made use of as in four-terminal linear networks, and a generalized reflection theory developed. Performance data are given for an idealized modulator under a variety of operating conditions."
"Previous papers before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers describe the development of a twelve-channel type J Carrier System. This paper discusses some of the practical problems encountered in extending the circuit capacity of existing open-wire lines by the use of this carrier system. The first systems of this type were placed in commercial operation late in 1938. One of these systems is discussed in detail from the standpoint of obtaining satisfactory operation with the most economical arrangement of new and existing facilities."
"The development of the type J twelve-channel carrier telephone system for open-wire lines required an increase of nearly 5 to 1 in the transmission frequency range of the lines. In the provision of suitable line facilities a number of new problems were encountered with respect to attenuation, noise and crosstalk. Methods for meeting these problems and the results obtained are described."
"Exploration of Pressure Field Around the Human Head During Speech.1 H. K. DUNN and D. W. FARNSWORTH. A single speaker in a seated position repeated a fifteen-second sample of connected speech. while r.m.s. pressure measurements were made in thirteen frequency hands, and at seventy-six positions, in different directions and distances. The results arc applicable to intelligibility and microphone placement problems. They show, in general, the greater variation with direction at higher frequencies. Directivity due to the size of the mouth opening appeared to enter above 5600 cycles per second, the axis at these frequencies being about 45° below the horizontal, in front."

"THE application of carrier telephone systems to toll cable conductors, particularly those conductors in existing cables, is expected to become an important means of providing additional long distance telephone circuits. Eight hundred and thirty-seven route miles have been equipped in the United States to date, and 17 twelve-channel systems have been placed in service, providing a total of about 58,000 circuit miles. Late in 1939, 200 additional route miles are expected to be completed which, together with additional systems on existing routes, will add nine systems and about 48,000 circuit miles to the above figures."
"During 1937 a 60-mile toll cable was completed between Toronto and Barrie which, in several respects, is unique. Among the interesting features in the design and construction of this toll cable were the use of non-quadded exchange cable and loading, a 60-mile repeater spacing, planning for future carrier operation, and extended pole spacings."
"A statistical method is described for computing the meter reading which would be obtained on a sound level meter when used to measure room noise resulting from the random concurrent operation of a number of intermittent or continuous noise sources. The application of the method in the solution of practical problems is illustrated."
"The amplifiers of multi-channel telephone systems must be so designed with regard to output capacity that interchannel interference caused by amplifier overloading will not be serious. Probability theory is applied to this problem to determine the maximum single frequency output power which a multi-channel amplifier should be designed to transmit as a function of N, the number of channels in the system. The theory is developed to include the effects of statistical variations in the number of simultaneous talkers, in the talking volumes, and in the instantaneous voltages from speech at constant volume."
"It is proposed to make this paper the first of a series of three dealing with the quantum physics of solids. This one will be concerned with the quantum states of electrons in crystals. The discussion will commence with an introductory section devoted to the failure of classical physics to account for phenomena of an atomic scale. Next, the quantum theory of electrons in atoms will be discussed, together with the resultant explanation of the structure of the periodic table; this is designed to illustrate the meaning of various quantum mechanical ideas which are important in understanding solids. Furthermore, much of the detailed information about atomic quantum states of particular atoms will be needed in the later discussion of the properties of certain solids. As an introduction to the modification of the quantum states occurring when atoms are put together to form a crystal, a short section will be devoted to structure of diatomic molecules. The next section will be concerned with quantum states for electrons in crystals. Whereas in an atom there are a series of isolated energies possible for an electron (corresponding to the various quantum states), in a crystal there are bands of allowed energies. This concept of energy bands is essential to the theory of crystals in much the same way that the concept of energy levels is essential to that of atoms. In terms of energy bands, the energy holding crystals together can be interpreted on a common basis for a wide variety of crystal types. This will be followed by a brief description of various crystal types and by a discussion of thermal properties in which the smallness of the electronic specific heat will be shown. The last section will be devoted to a discussion of para and ferromagnetism on the basis of the energy band picture. In the second paper, problems connected with electric currents and the motion of electrons through crystals will be discussed. This leads to the concept of the Brillouin zone which is complementary to that of the energy band, the two together forming the basis for discussing the quantum states of electrons in crystals. The third paper of the series will contain a comparison between theory and experiment for the alkali metals, the principal emphasis being placed upon the physical picture of the state of affairs in these simple metals."
"The mathematical theory is developed for the spring clutch which consists of two coaxial cylinders placed end to end and coupled torsionally by a coil spring fitted over them. Relations are derived whereby it is possible to design spring clutches in terms of the requirements and the constants of the spring material. Experimental verification of the relations is given. The theory of residual and active stresses as applied to the springs is discussed."
"Recent Observations on the Relation between Penetration, Infection and Decay in Creosoted Southern Pine Poles in Line.1 C. H. AMADON. The relation between poor penetration and decay, and the necessity for rational and adequate penetration requirements in treating specifications, are now fairly well understood by producers and users of creosoted southern pine poles. The purpose of this brief paper is to supplement the information presented in the Proceedings for 1936 and 1937 on the behavior of these poles in line under actual service conditions."

"THIS paper may be regarded both as a continuation of a prior one by the writer and Thornton C. Fry1 and as a companion of that by J. G. Chaffee 2 the inventor of the circuit under consideration. For an understanding of the present, an acquaintance with the prior paper1 is absolutely necessary, since the fundamental analysis and the formulas there developed are too lengthy to be repeated here. References to that paper will be designated by (Ref.)."
"Negative feedback can be applied to a frequency-modulation receiver of superheterodyne type by causing a portion of the output voltage to frequency-modulate the local oscillator in such phase as to reduce the output signal. As a consequence of this arrangement the effective frequency modulation of the intermediate wave is diminished by the feedback factor. This reduction is accompanied by a decrease in noise and distortion. Restoration of the original signal level by increasing the degree of modulation at the transmitter brings about a corresponding increase in signal-to-noise ratio provided the disturbance is not too great, while distortion ratios are improved to about the same extent. These effects are treated analytically for the case where the disturbance level is sufficiently low to permit simplifying assumptions to be made. The results are in general agreement with observations made on an experimental laboratory system. Comparing the feedback system with a frequency-modulation system using amplitude limitation, the ratio of signal level to noise level in the absence of modulation is identical in two systems. During modulation the noise level increases in the feedback system by an amount depending upon the ratio of the effective frequency shift of the intermediate-frequency wave to the signal band width. By keeping this ratio small, the increase in noise during modulation can be made relatively unimportant. In cases where the disturbance level is high, phenomena have been observed which are very similar to those encountered when amplitude limitation is used."
"The great diversity of magnetic characteristics demanded by telephone apparatus, and the large number of available magnetic materials propose intricate problems in the choice of materials and design of apparatus to attain greatest efficiency and economy. The present paper undertakes to evaluate magnetic materials in relation to apparatus needs. After a review of the earlier developments, the materials now available are listed, together with data on technical characteristics and raw materials costs. The advantages of various materials for specific applications are described. The scope of possible further improvements in magnetic materials is surveyed."
"The input impedance of an idealized space charge grid tube is investigated under general conditions of space charge between the accelerating grid and the negatively biased control grid. It is shown that under certain space charge conditions the input capacitance and conductance both may be negative. These impedance properties persist up to frequencies for which the transit angle is quite large. Possibilities of designing electronic negative capacitances are thus opened up. Experimental results are also given; these give a broad confirmation of the theoretical deductions."
"Plastics are used extensively in the manufacture of telephone apparatus and equipment. They belong to the class of materials known as insulators but are very often employed not only for their electrical properties but for their unique manufacturing and structural possibilities. Good insulating materials are very important in the telephone field although the voltage and current used are much smaller than in the power field. Progressive improvement in transmission, especially for long distance telephone service, has required that the telephone industry as a whole provide sensitive instruments and that there be a minimum loss of the electrical impulse due to leakage through insulating materials."
"This paper deals with the variation of a-c conductivity with frequency and with that of apparent d-c conductivity with charging time for dielectrics exhibiting anomalous dispersion (i.e., having dielectric constants which decrease with increasing frequency). The a-c conductivity of a dielectric exhibiting simple anomalous dispersion approaches a constant limiting value γ∞ as the frequency increases. The discussion shows that γ∞ possesses properties similar to those of the conductivity due to free ions, although in most cases it depends upon the motions of polar molecules or bound ions. It is also shown that the apparent conductivity for constant (d-c) potential approaches an initial value as the charging time is diminished. This initial conductivity γ0 is demonstrated to be equal to the limiting value of the a-c conductivity attained at high frequencies (γ∞), a relationship which simplifies the description of the behavior of dielectrics exhibiting simple anomalous dispersion. Dielectrics possessing the property of anomalous dispersion then have two conductivities: one is due to local motions of polar molecules or bound ions; the other is due to the migration of free ions to the electrodes. Both γ0 and γ∞ refer to methods of measurement. It is to be noted that in many non-homogeneous dielectrics, especially those in which one part is of much higher resistivity than the remainder, both γ 0 and γ∞ may be a measure of a free ion conductivity. As the equality of γ0 and γ∞ is independent of the nature of the polarization responsible for them, experimental agreement between a-c and d-c measurements cannot be used to distinguish whether the dielectric loss in a material is due to polar molecules, to bound ions, or to free ions present in a non-homogeneous dielectric. However, in homogeneous dielectrics γ0 (or γ∞) is a conductivity due to polar molecules or bound ions."
"Radio Telephone System for Harbor and Coastal Services.1 C. N. ANDERSON and H. M. Prüden. Radio telephone service with harbor and coastal vessels is now being given through coastal stations in the vicinities of seven large harbors on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts with additional stations planned.

The Franklin Institute of Philadelphia recently awarded him the Elliott Cresson Medal. He is now a research mathematician."
"Certain types of electrostatic fields may be used as lenses to focus electron beams. The theory of these lenses is developed for electric fields that are symmetrical about a central axis. The introduction of two velocity functions exactly reduces the partial differential equations of electron motion to a series of ordinary differential equations. The first equation describes the action of a lens for electron paths near the axis; the remaining equations determine the higher order aberration terms. Sections on the following subjects are included: the general equations of electronoptics, thin lenses, thick lenses, aberration, the reduction of aberraration, apertured plates, and concentric tubes. A list of symbols and lens equations is also included at the end of the article."
"Equivalent modulator circuits are developed in the form of linear resistance networks. They are equivalent in the sense that the current magnitude in any mesh of the network is equal to the current amplitude of a corresponding frequency component in the modulator. The elements of the network are determined by the properties of the modulator, while the terminating resistances are those physically existent in the connected circuit. With this correspondence demonstrated, the operating features of the modulator may be deduced from the known properties of linear networks. Among the properties considered are the transfer efficiency from signal to sideband, and the input resistance to signal as affected by the sideband load resistance. Equivalent networks are worked out for a number of interesting cases, involving different impedances to unwanted modulation products, together with different non-linear characteristics. The equivalents come out comparatively simple in form under the restrictions noted and followed in the text, which make the carrier large compared to the signal, and the circuit elements purely resistive."
"This paper describes an improved three-channel carrier telephone system for use on open-wire lines. It employs recent advances in the telephone art to bring about many economies and circuit simplifications as compared with previous models of the three-channel system. A new type of automatic regulating equipment is included."
"This paper describes the crossbar dial telephone switching system recently adopted by the Bell System for large cities where the panel system has been used for nearly twenty years. Central offices of the crossbar type can be introduced in panel areas without changes in existing offices and without changes in existing dial telephone instruments. Crossbar offices and panel offices in the same building will operate on a common power plant and utilize other equipment in common, such as “A” and “B” operator switchboards and outgoing trunks. The precious metal contact crossbar switches are used for all switching purposes as contrasted with the base metal contact panel switches. The switches operate with relay-like movements under control of common control or marker circuits consisting primarily of multi-contact, U and Y type relays. The control and marker circuits, which are connected to the switch frames by means of multi-contact relays, perform their operations in a fraction of a second. The switches, the U and Y type relays and the multi-contact relays are equipped with twin contacts of precious metal. Senders similar to those of the panel system are employed. The system will be used for new offices in larger cities as manufacturing and plant conditions permit."
"A new carrier telephone system is described, together with its application in the long distance telephone plant. By its use, an open-wire pair which already furnishes one voice circuit and three carrier circuits may have twelve more telephone circuits added. Thus in all sixteen telephone circuits are obtained on a single pair. Several such systems may be operated on a pole line. Various problems incident to the extension of the frequency range, from about 30 kilocycles, the highest frequency previously used, to above 140 kilocycles, are discussed. Among the more important of these are the control of crosstalk between several systems on a pole line, arrangements for taking care of intermediate and terminal cables, and automatic means for compensating for the effects of weather variations on the transmission over this wide frequency range."
"This paper describes the progress which has been made in recent years in the development of methods and apparatus for the measurement of telegraph transmission in the Bell System. Such measurements play an important part in transmission maintenance work in the field and are also necessary in development work. The changes which have occurred in service requirements, particularly the large commercial development of start-stop teletypewriter service and the effect of these changes on the technique of telegraph transmission measurement, are first discussed; then a description is given of several new measuring devices and their use."
"Even after fifteen years of intensive research following on two decades of more desultory study, the cosmic rays are still a store of new and remarkable data. The question of their ultimate origin, though by no means extinct, has been set aside by many physicists in favor of a fuller inquiry into their qualities. The distinctive mark of the cosmic-ray particles is the immensity of their energies; for, great by all previous standards as are the energy-values which physicists now can impart in their laboratories, those manifest in the cosmic rays are greater by factors not of thousands merely, but often of millions. To this remote and exalted energy-range belong the penetrating particles capable of cleaving through a metre of lead, and the wonderful and beautiful phenomenon of cosmic-ray showers. It is not to be wondered at that with energies so high, particles so familiar as electrons and photons should be invested with unfamiliar powers. So evidently they are; but some of the charged corpuscles of the cosmic rays have properties such that their strangeness cannot be ascribed to high energy alone, but apparently must be based upon some fundamental difference (perhaps a difference of mass) from all the particles thus far identified."
"Editor's note: The following was presented by Mr. Harrison as the closing address of a symposium on the effects of the hurricane and floods of September 21, 1938 on transportation, power and communication utilities. The symposium was held in New York at the Winter Convention of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Thursday, January 26, 1939. After the close of the meeting a motion picture on the hurricane prepared by the Bell System for the information of its own employees was shown."
"There is described a radio altimeter that gives continuously on the plane a measurement of the separation between the plane and the earth's surface or projections therefrom. There is projected from the plane and reflected from the earth back to it a very short radio wave, the frequency of which is continuously swung back and forth. The returned wave is thereby made to differ from the outgoing wave in frequency by an amount that is proportional to the echo path; and the difference or “beat” frequency is indicated on a frequency meter calibrated in feet of separation. The paper outlines some of the early efforts in this field, some of the technical problems involved, the theory of the system and the practical experimental results that have been obtained."
"Late in 1937 a large construction project was completed which added 16 telephone circuits to the transcontinental layout, and the work was so planned that 48 additional circuits can be obtained by the addition of equipment but without stringing additional wire. A brief description of some features of this project and the general development of the transcontinental telephone routes since the first one was opened for service in 1915 is given in this article. Although most of the discussion relates to transcontinental lines, the methods described are generally applicable to other similar situations."
"Paper as a Medium for Analytical Reactions. 1 B. L. Clarke and H. W. Hermance. Absorbent paper has long been used in chemical laboratories for filtering suspensions. Paper has also found a special use as a container or holder for certain testing reagents; litmus paper is a common example. In this article and a preceding one (Indus. & Engg. Chem., Anal. Ed., June 15, 1937), are reported exploratory investigations on the extension of the use of absorbent papers in chemical analysis."

American Telephone and Telegraph Company, Engineering Department and the Department of Development and Research, 1916–34; Bell Telephone Laboratories, 1934–. As Assistant Director of Transmission Development, Mr. Affel is concerned with toll transmission problems, including the development of carrier telephone systems."
"Data are given on the amount and distribution of light which can be obtained on the transparent screen with regular high-intensity carbons and various optical systems. These optical systems include two condenser-type systems and two relay-condenser-type systems used with f/2.3 and f/2.0 objective lenses. Values are obtained which are in line with the recommendations on Process Projection Equipment by the Research Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. — In addition, characteristics of two new carbons developed for this purpose are given. These are also evaluated in the relay-condenser system and give the advantage of additional light, or the same light at lower energy input."
"Recent improvements in carbons for broadside lamps and spotlamps are described. New negative carbons, designed for use with spotlamps result in more quietly burning arcs. — New carbons have been designed for broadside lamps giving quieter burning and steadier light. The light is of the same spectral quality as that of the spotlamp-filter combinations used for Technicolor photography. Curves of spectral energy distribution of light received on the set and records illustrating the improved steadiness and quieter burning are shown."
"The design requirements for this type of unit and how these requirements were met in the selection of truck, body design, equipment layout, etc., are discussed. The recording equipment utilized together with the power equipment and other special features of the unit are described. This type of unit has been in successful operation without revision."
"The use of an a-c polarizing potential on a gas type PEC produces an alternating output current as compared with the continuous current obtained with a d-c polarizing potential. If the output voltage from the cell is suitably connected to a conventional audio-frequency amplifier and copper-oxide rectifier meter, the equipment may be conveniently used as an exposure meter. When used for the line-up of variable-density light-valves, the proper bias current, lamp adjustment, and lamp current may be readily determined. Variations of valve spacing and lamp current are also indicated. Numerous other applications for such a meter are being considered."
"A direct-reading densitometric method is described for the determination of the approximate cross-modulation cancellation of bilateral variable-area prints. This method makes use of the relationship between film rectification and the accompanying change in the mean transmission of a modulated print. The static measurement tells the direction as well as the approximate amount of the print density deviation from optimum. Complete measurements can be obtained with only a few inches of film, compared with several feet required by the routine dynamic measurement of cancellation. The method may simplify the checking of release prints."
"A direct-reading photoelectric densitometer has been built which shows the density of the area being measured at a reading window. A density range front 0 to 3.0 is covered with a reproducibility of approximately ∓0.00.5. A motor-driven circular neutral wedge is used as the balancing means and the density scale marked on the wedge is read by a stroboscopic flashing light."
"The term “acoustic condition factor” is used as a general term descriptive of the acoustic environs of a point in an enclosure. Relationships expressed as ratios are given for several quantities, such as “useful” and “harmful” sound, direct, and generally reflected sound energy and sound intensity. Curves are shown representing loci for partial antinodes produced by interference between direct and first as well as second reflections in a rectangular room in which the sound source is located symmetrically. Equations are given expressing the minimal distance between source of sound and microphone for the probable avoidance of recording absolute nodes."
"This paper avoids technicalities and formulas, reaching back to elementary acoustics which are often side-tracked. Controlled reflection plays the leading role, with the minor parts delegated to sound diffusion and uniform energy distribution. Although much can be mathematically proved, the only satisfying conditions are the apparent ones, which are judged and gauged by the normal human ears. — Audio effects due to the physical characteristics of both sound absorbents and building materials are explained and their proper locations emphasized. Although a room can have the desired optimal reverberation time over the entire frequency response characteristic, it can still be unsuitable for the rendition of speech and music that is clear and distinct; the shape, size, and contours of the six surfaces in a room, plus the incidental equipment and purpose, are the deciding factors on how much and where the reflecting and absorbing materials should be placed."
"When the modern optical industry was born, this country was predominantly agricultural. Its principal industrial developments related to transportation. It was natural, therefore, that Europe should have gained great prestige in the field of optics in the final quarter of the nineteenth century. — With the turn of the century, however, agricultural developments had about reached their limit and industrial activity began to occupy a larger place in American life. Along with others the optical industry felt the incentive to greater activity and the first fifteen years of this century saw a rapid advance in the magnitude of the industry and improvement in the quality of its product. — We are still, however, completely dependent on European sources of supply for our optical glass and for some of the small-demand class of laboratory instruments. Then came the war that not only cut of all aid from Europe but ultimately led Europe to our doors with appeals for optical munitions. — The war only hastened what would have been inevitable anyway, viz., the complete independence of America in optical matters. — The American optical industry has now reached a point where its raw materials (optical glass) and its technical skill recognize no superiors. It can make any practical optical element or instrument for which quantitative specifications can be written."
"A brief survey is made of the history of motion pictures in education and their use as a teaching aid; the present status of 16-mm sound pictures and projectors in schools; types of educational pictures available and their sources; the distinction between auditorium and classroom films; types and sources of auditorium films currently used; types and sources of classroom films; cost of films; their acceptability by teacher groups and coöperation of non-profit educational groups toward creation of adequate classroom libraries; and a plan is suggested for an educational-film-producing organization to meet school needs."
"The color intensity of a motion picture projection system may affect the presentation of the picture. Using sample comparison methods the average color of projection systems can be determined and the deviation of a particular system measured."
"Motion picture film will form an important source of programs for television broadcasting. Film projectors for this use are required to meet a number of conditions peculiar to television. Methods for projecting and utilizing motion picture film are outlined. A specific film projector and associated television channel are described in some detail. — In establishing a technic for producing films most suitable for television, equipment is needed to interpret the final results. Apparatus that wall he used by broadcasting stations is described. A simpler system has been designed that may be useful for the specialized service of gauging the merit of films for television This is described and its operation indicated. — Some very preliminary observations are included on the characteristics of films that have given good results in experimental work and in field tests."
"A motion picture film scanner, the first of the continuous type to be used for television transmissions, is described. The apparatus was put into operation in New York City in the summer of 1937 and has been in use since. In its preferred form the scanner projects the image of a continuously moving film onto the cathode of a dissector tube. Five images, representing different portions of the film in the gate, produced by five stationary lenses, are superimposed one on top of the other, while a rotating shutter with concentric slots permits only one lens at a time to produce an image. The scanning is accomplished partly by the uniform motion of the film and partly by the magnetic scanning of the electron image in the opposite direction. The pictures thus obtained are completely free from shading, cover a great range of contrast, are free from flicker, and are steady. The construction of the scanner is simple and inexpensive."
"The studio operating technic as practiced in the NBC television studios today is discussed and comparisons are made, where possible, to motion picture technic. Preliminary investigations conducted to derive a television operating technic revealed that both the theater and the motion picture could contribute certain practices. — The problems of lighting, scenic design, background projection, and make-up are discussed, with special emphasis on the difficulties and differences that make television studio practice unique. — An explanation is given of the functioning of a special circuit used in television sound pick-up to aids in the creation of the illusion of close-up and long-shot sound perspective without impracticable amount of microphone movement. The paper concludes with a typical television production routine showing the coördination and timing of personnel and equipment required in producing a television program."
"Lighting a television production presents many problems peculiar to this new field of public entertainment. These problems have necessitated the redesign of lighting equipment and the establishment of a simplified technic for handling the equipment that differs radically from moving picture practice. — To cope properly with the lighting requirements of the continuous action sequences, characterizing television, productions, a system employing inside silvered incandescent lamps in a standardized unit was developed by NBC engineers. Based on multiple standardized group of 1½ kw each, these units are used in both the foundation light and modeling equipment of the television studios in Radio City, thus insuring quantitative as well as qualitative control of lighting by the personnel. — With cameras generally in motion and an average duration of pick-up from one camera a matter of seconds, the problem of modeling in the sets becomes acute. This appears to be satisfactorily solved by the technic now in use wherein the major interest is centered around the close-up camera. Even this solution, however, required new and ingenious equipment to maintain light in the sets and still give floor precedence to the cameras and sound equipment. — While NBC at the present time has appeared to have standardized on the inside silvered lump, exhaustive tests were carried out in an attempt to utilize more orthodox equipment. Actual tests under production conditions proved, however, that certain requirements of space, weight, and flexibility could not be had without a serious sacrifice of foot-candles on. the set, resulting in the present set-up of equipment and personnel that are handling the television lighting assignment in the East. — Under these circumstances, our producers—relying on their scientific skill, the richness of their facilities and resources, and the variety and range of talent available to them in every field-will, it would seem, be well advised to stress most strongly in the foreign markets the factor of the superior quality of American films. We should export only pictures of unquestioned excellence. High quality will continue to retain for American motion pictures an exceedingly worth-while place in the markets of the world."
"The current television technical facilities of the Don Lee Broadcasting System in Los Angeles are briefly described. A mosaic type camera and accompanying Don Lee control equipment are used. A coaxial cable conveys the signal therefrom to the W6XAO sight-sound television transmitters, operating on daily schedule on 45 and 49.75 megacycles, respectively. — The routine of production of a dramatic comedy serial entitled, “Vim Street,” in its forty-eighth biweekly episode at this writing, is utilized as an example. A tota1 time of twenty hours of one or more members of the dramatic unit is required to prepare and present one fifteen-minute episode. — The sequence of production is as follows: preparation of script; construction or modification of props and scenery; cast memorization of lines; cast rehearsals; camera, sound, sound-effects, light rehearsal with production staff; make-up; the performance itself, including visual aural introduction of the act; the performance proper with overall supervision of lighting, microphone, and television adjustments by a television-producer at a distant receiver; closing announcement; written and verbal report of errors or advances in technic made during the performance. — Specifications, for the: physical instrumentalities and the current television technic are covered for each of the above factors of production."
"A discussion is presented of the present-day television standards as adopted by the Radio Manufacturers Association, stressing their importance in relation to the design and production of television receiving equipment. — Emphasis is placed upon the limitations of the standards and the possibility of their obsolescence in the future. It is claimed that the lack of flexibility embodied therein is very likely to cause serious. difficulties for the industry in the future, for the transmission of a video signal is a much. more complex problem than the transmission of an audio signal as in modern radio broadcasting where standards were relatively unimportant. — As an aid to circumventing any of the limitations of the present tentative standards, a new system of television transmission standards is proposed which will greatly simplify the considerations involved in the design of television receivers."
"A report on the aims and work of the Committee, with partial reports by the two sub-committees: (A) on Television Production and Reproduction Technic, O. B. Hanson, Chairman, and (B) Film Properties and Laboratory Practice, O. Sandvik, Chairman. The scopes of activity of the sub-committees are described, and their program for the coming year. Among the items covered by these scopes are (1) glossary, (2) bibliography, (3) tutorial material, (4) dimensional practices, (5) normal equipment and procedure, (6) special problems such as inter-industry coordination. future equipment needs. and specifications, etc."
"Sound reproduction systems are designed on the premise that the sound-track will be illuminated by a scanning-beam of substantially uniform flux density. This paper presents results of extensive studies of the actual beam characteristics for all types of optical systems and lamps employed in the reproduction of sound from film. They were made possible by a unique microphotometer, designed by the author, with which the scanning beam can be analyzed in minute elements. — The studies cover: relative levels of scanning beam illumination; effect of source displacement from design position on total flux at the sound-track; microphotometer recordings of distribution of flux density across the beam as affected by optical systems and source forms and by displacements of the source."
"An explanation is given of lighting problems from the viewpoint of the cinematographer. Certain advances in equipment and working tools remain in obscurity for a long period before they find their rightful places in motion picture set lighting because they seem to interfere with dramatic effect. If they possess merit however, they are gradually adapted to general use. A typical example is the light-meter. which is now going through the final stages of assimilation to studio lighting technic. New fast films have been brought into rue and the resulting changes in lighting technic are now in the process of perfection. Recent changes in lighting equipment are described. Three new higher speed negative films for the Technicolor process are being med. The effect of the new films on Technicolor set lighting is explained."
"A report of the work of the Committee since the last Convention. Work on the proposed revision of the NFPA Regulations for Handling Nitrocellulose Motion Picture Film has been completed and the revision will be placed before the NFPA at the Chicago meeting in May. The present report discusses also the Committee's search for practicable and inexpensive light-measuring instruments for use in theaters, in addition to other subjects engaging the attention of the several sub-committees."

"Unlike political subdivisions of this earth, the moving picture world has two capitals. Last April we were entertained in the production capital at Hollywood, California, and from all reports, our meeting was considered about the most successful we have ever had. This fall, the financial, exhibition, and distribution capital is our host, and those of us who live here, welcome you to our city and to the halls of our convention."
"Nearly 250 members and guests of the Society assembled at the Fall, 1939, Semi-Annual Banquet held at the Hotel Pennsylvania, New York, N. Y., on October 18th. Guests at the speakers' table were: President and Mrs. Williford; Mr. and Mrs. Frank Meyer of Paramount Picturcs, Inc.; Mr. and Mrs. D. E. Hyndman; Dr. L. A. Jones, recipient of the 1939 Progress Medal; Dr. Alfred N. Goldsmith, citationist for Dr. Jones; Dr. H. T. Kalmus, recipient of the 1938 Journal Award; Mr. E. P. Curtis, citationist for Dr. Kalmus; Mr. C;. F. Lewis, Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation; Mr. E. G. Hines, International Projector Corporation; and Mr. J. I. Crabtree, Editorial Vice-President. After introducing those seated at the speakers' table, President Williford announced the results of the annual election of officers for 1940 which were as follows."
"Some problems involved in the production of satisfactory three-dimensional motion pictures have not received much mention in the literature dealing with stereoscopy. Their practical solution has contributed marked improvements to the three-dimensional picture of today. — The fundamental problem in projecting three-dimensional pictures is that of providing a “right-eye” picture that will reach only the right eye and be prevented from reaching the left eye, and to do the same for the “left-eye” picture. To attain this result two methods have been employed with success, namely: the “anaglyph” in which substantially complementary colors are employed in the viewing devices, and polarized light. — The screen surface upon which three-dimensional pictures are projected by polarization methods is of extreme importance. The selection of the proper type of screen raises real problems but these also have been overcome in a practical way."
"An electroöptical method of producing reverberation synthetically is described. The method employed consists in recording the original program on the rim of a phosphor-coated disk by means of a modulated light-source and then picking up the continuously decaying sound images after a predetermined time interval by means of photocells. — The exponential decay curve of the phosphorescent substance produces an infinite number of secondary sound impulses to which any desired decay characteristic can be applied. This reverberation signal is then mixed with the original program in the proportion required. — This new reverberation device has been employed in radio broadcasting and can be used in phonograph as well as in motion picture sound recording, where the scenic effect or script requires a type of sound which, due to the deadness of the sound stage, might not readily be available. — This device would replace the use of so-called echo chambers, at the same time introducing an appreciable amount of flexibility without degrading the quality of the original sound."
"The use of the optical penumbra to obtain linear variable-intensity light-modulation has already been described. The present paper shows how to obtain non-linear penumbras having predetermined intensity-amplitude characteristics. By this means it is possible to compensate optically for non-linear relation between negative exposure and print transmission known to exist in the variable-density system. — Variable-density noise-reduction has been obtained by moving the penumbra vane at right angles to the optical axis in accordance with the volume of the original sound. If a fixed penumbra vane is placed close to the movable vane, it forms an optical end-stop which limits the deflection of the penumbra after it has reached a predetermined position. The optical characteristics of penumbras formed by two displaced vanes are also shown. — For a given amplitude of galvanometer-mirror vibration, the extent of the light-modulation is determined by the penumbra height at the recording slit. The penumbra height may be varied by moving the penumbra vane along the optical axis. Either compression or expansion of the sound volume obtained from a film record may be effected by causing the penumbra vane to move along the axis in accordance with the volume of the original sound. Such a system is described in detail. — A combined system is also described which permits both noise-reduction and compression to be obtained by the use of a single shutter and noise-reduction amplifier."
"Progression from standard variable-area types of recording to class A push-pull and finally from class A to class B push-pull was primarily motivated by an appreciation of the inherent advantages of the push-pull types of recordings, and an ability to perfect processing and recording controls necessary to realize the finer qualities of the class B push-pull recording. The adoption of class B push-pull variable-area for original recording has eliminated distortion introduced by noise-reduction systems, and has reduced background noise by at least 6 db."
"A new method of transmission and reproduction of line images, e. g., drawings, is described which utilizes a cathode-ray tube for reproduction, the spot of which is made to trace out the lines of the image 20 or more times a second. The steps of the complete process are: first, the transcription of the line image into two tracks similar to sound-tracks on moving picture film; second, the production from these tracks of two varying potentials by means of photoelectric pick-up devices; third, the transmission of these potentials; and fourth, their application to the cathoderay deflector plates to effect reproduction. Satisfactory transmission of fairly complex images, e. g., animated cartoons, could be effected within a total band-width of 10,000 cycles."
"A television film chain with particular reference to amplifier, sweep and power circuits in the film pick-up unit is described. — Many improvements in television circuits have been made possible by recent advances in circuits and circuit components in radio and allied electronic fields. Application of some of the newer ideas to motion picture film pick-up equipment has resulted in improved performance and simplicity of operation. — Circuit arrangements which permit flexibility in transmission standards are considered and their application discussed. Also the anticipation of possible future improvement in picture quality is indicated in some circuit capabilities."
"The “time telescope” or combination time-lapse and photoelectric exposure control machine speeds up imperceptible motion. The variable-exposure control with exposure modulator gives either a gradual change in density, or equal average frame densities regardless of spectral or intensity changes in subject lighting. It corrects for failure of film to follow the reciprocity law. Photoelectrically regulated, it automatically exposes the subject properly regardless of changes in color, area, and average light intensity during or between exposures. Long periods of time between exposures make possible the use of a small fixed diaphragm (f/256)."
"The editors present for convenient reference a list of articles dealing with subjects cognate to motion picture engineering published in a number of selected journals. Photostatic copies may be obtained from the Library of Congress, Washington, D. C., or from the New York Public Library, New York, N. Y. Micro copies of articles in magazines that are available may be obtained from the Bibliofilm Service, Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C."
"During the Conventions of the Society, symposiums on new motion picture apparatus are held, in which various manufacturers of equipment describe and demonstrate their new products and developments. Some of this equipment is described in the following pages; the remainder will be published in subsequent issues of the Journal."
"Flicker in motion pictures has been receiving attention ever since the beginning of the art, and most of the source of this defect have been minimized, if not eliminated, by technical accomplishments. The paper constitutes a qualitative review of the now prevalent sources of flicker, presenting some new concepts, emphasizing the sources of major importance at the present time, and reporting on two investigations made on the problem. Flicker and “registration jump” are differentiated, and the latter, which is really a separate problem, is not considered. Some data are presented to indicate the magnitude and characteristics of the flicker effect."
"A brief account is given of the development of the process projection art, and the difficulties that arose due to its intial haphazard evolution. — Following this is an account of the work of the Process Projection Equipment Committee of the Research Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, leading up to the recommendations of the Committee with regard to the projection equipment used in the process."
"A microphone is described which has uniform directivity over a wide frequency range. This is made possible by placing in a single instrument a dynamic type pressure microphone element and a ribbon type “velocity” element, and electrically equalizing the outputs before combination. The resultant directional pattern is a heart-shaped curve or cardioid, giving a fairly wide pick-up zone in front and a substantial dead zone at the back of the instrument. Because of the unusually rugged ribbon employed, the new microphone is much less susceptible to wind noise than ordinary ribbon types. Housed in an aluminum case, the microphone weighs only 3¼ lbs. High output level, low impedance, and high quality, together with the excellent directivity, promise to make the cardioid microphone an important tool for the motion picture sound engineer."
"Factors influencing the choice of a microphone for sound recording are considered. The characteristics of a new miniature condenser transmitter and amplifier, as well as a number of other types of microphones now in use, are included."
"After an explanation of the term Class A-B and a brief specification of such a recording system, the general requirements for the operation operation Class A-B system are given and illustrated. — Differences between the operation of push-pull photocells and push-pull vacuum tubes are pointed out and explained, and a discussion of the relative advantages of Class A, Class A-B, and Class B push-pull tracks is given."
"A fundamentally new principle in desgn of photographic developers has been investigated and found to afford many worthwhile characteristics, chief of which is the effective self-replenishing Property of the developer solutions. Application of the new principle to developer solution makes it possible to develop about eight times the quantity of film as would be possible under ordinary conditions. The principle may be applied to any developer."
"Improvements in the technic of recording and printing during the past few years have made possible the production of 16-mm. sound-films, either by optical reduction or by direct recording. having considerably better quality than is being obtained in general commercial practice. By the use of a moderate degree of equalization in recording, it it practicable to obtain from 16-mm. negatives prints giving a flat frequency response to 6000 cycles, with useful response to 7500 cycles, when reproduced through a flat amplifying system. Harmonic and envelope distortion and speed variations can be kept within acceptable limits for high-quality reproduction. The principal remaining defect is background noise. Some, general agreement upon commercial 16-mm. reproducing system characteristics is needed, however, before this improved quality can be made generally available."
"Fluorescent lamps provide a new tool for solving some of the lighting problems encountered in the motion picture industry. A low-pressure glow discharge in mercury vapor and an efficient fluorescing powder are the chief features of such lamps. The differences between them and the ordinary filament lamps are many—not only with regard to design but with respect to their operating characteristics. These differences are discussed and many characteristics are shown for both the lamps and the necessary auxiliary equipment. The daylight quality of light which may be produced at high efficiencies and the relative lack of radiant heat make the new lamps attractive for several applications in studios."
"The editors present for convenient reference a list of articles dealing with subjects cognate to motion picture engineering published in a number of selected journals. Photostatic copies may be obtained from the Library of Congress, Washington, D. C., or from the New York Public Library, N. Y. Micro copies of articles in magazines that are available may be obtained from the Bibliofilm Service, Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C."
"The dates of the first recorded use of underwater photography and the tendencies toward its increasing use by producers are noted, and the author's early experiences in this field are described. For work in natural settings the most useful equipment consists of submergible cameras placed on the bottom and operated by divers. The problems of and equipment for such work are dealt with and it is pointed out that studio tank work shares most of these problems. — The optical properties of water are described. Since water is less transparent than air, photography by natural light is limited to shallow depths and more power is required for artificial illumination under water. Since colors are not absorbed equally, accurate monochrome rendering and photography in natural color are complicated. Haze limits the distance at which pictures can be taken under water, but is largely confined to a part of the spectrum and can be partially eliminated by the use of color filters. It is plane polarized and can, therefore, also be suppressed by the use of polarizing plates. The advantages of this method are briefly stated—it does not distort monochrome rendering and can be used in natural color photography. — The ideal attributes of equipment for use in underwater cinematography are outlined and available equipment is briefly described."
"Now that television standards have been agreed upon in the United States, commercial receiving sets will undoubtedly be available very soon, and regularly scheduled television programs may be expected at the same time. How good will the television be and what are the problems yet to be solved before television reaches the technical maturity that radio has today? These are questions of considerable interest to engineers in related &Us, and are the subject mutter of the present paper. The quality of present-day television pictures is compared with that of motion pictures both in the theater and in the home. A discussion is given of the problems that have been solved to make television what it is today, and consideration is given to the problems that must be solved to make television what we hope it will be tomorrow. The problems of signal propagation and interference are discussed, and the matter of network program distribution is considered. Finally, a short introduction is given to the commercial problems in television."
"In a previous report of the Studio Lighting Committee the need of a catalogue of studio lighting equipment was emphasized. A number of papers have been published which describe various lamps and light-sources in detail, but there has not been assembled in one paper a symposium of all types of equipment and light-sources used on motion picture sets. — This report covers all types of equipment in general use. The various lighting units are numbered and briefly described. Photographs of popular lamps are shown. Tables give minimum and maximum beam divergences, carbon and bulb sizes. Reference numbers are assigned to the various lamps for convenience in listing their characteristics. This report covers all types of equipment in general use. Data on light control devices and lump filters are included."
"An account is given of the various types of photography used in the feature production “Topper.” Among the shots discussed are a split screen against a projected background, demonstrating the feasibility of such treatment. Other effects are: multiple exposures, animated split screen, animated travelling mattes, straight animation, intricate matching of action, and a new process of subtractive matting. — A statement is included on the precautions taken to eliminate weave between the production shots taken with Mitchell cameras and the duping. which was done on Bell & Howell machines. The paper is illustrated with various selections from the picture, made by the processes described."
"In a previous paper the writer attempted to show that the latent photographic image is formed in two distinct and separate steps. In the present paper this theory is compared with recent physical research. The writer concludes that each of the photographic steps consists of the attraction of one electropositive silver ion to a sensitizing speck on the grain surface which has previously captured an electron. — The reciprocity law failure at high intensities is explained by the minimum time required for the attraction of a silver ion. The reciprocity law failure at low intensities, is explained by assuming that a sensitizing speck which has attracted only one silver, ion is unstable and that the number of grains activated by a single capture decreases exponentially with time. — From these physical theories the whiter deduces mathematical relations governing the photographic characteristics. H&U curves and reciprocity failure curves computed front these relations are in good qualitative agreement with experimental curves. — The assumption of an unstable intermediate state of insufficiently exposed grains implies certain effects of delayed fogging (and delayed development which are verified by experiments."
"Test methods for the evaluation OJ motion-picture film for permanent records require test specimens too large to be removed from certain archival films. To assist those charged with the preservation of such 3lms in determining the quality and checking the condition of them, suitable semimicro methods were developed for acidity, viscosity, and residual hypo content. Specimens as small as 7 mg. in weight, removed from the film with a small hand punch, gave satisfactory results for the purpose."
"Certain of the characteristics of television have their counterparts in motion pictures, and motion picture film and motion picture practice are applicable to television. Some of the problems and limitations pertaining thereto are outlined, and the following television-image characteristics are briefly discussed: (1) Number of scanning lines and the relationship to image size and viewing distance; (2) number of frames; (3) interlacing. — The effect of film and optical system limitations on reproduced television images is illustrated by photographs, and curves are given showing the spectral characteristics of Iconoscopes. The screen color characteristics of Kinescopes are also discussed, and the overall range and gamma characteristics of a television system are reviewed."
"The binaural effect, while of great importance in our day-to-day life, has been an unexplored field in our conventional monaural sound motion picture which, despite our other technical advances, remains incapable of the quality called sound “perspective.” — To achieve the missing quality, it is important that controllably variable perspective effects be attainable for the release print from an original having different perspective quality. This is necessary not only to make the sound recorded on a three-walled set simulate the sound from a six-sided room, but also to make the recorded sound correspond satisfactorily with the view portrayed by the camera. — A new system is described that not only fulfills these fundamental requirements, but also is capable of controllably producing at will the various perspective and quality-change effects in a simple dubbing operation from a source having no perspective characteristics such as a conventional monaural sound-track. The new method may be introduced step by step into our present production system without material obsolescence of either films or equipment."
"In past practice, acoustics has been overlooked as a function of the architectural planning of motion picture theater structures. The need for and the extensive use of sound-absorbing devices in existing buildings have led to reliance upon corrective methods in the planning of new designs. — The constructive approach to the solution of acoustical problems in new design is achieved only through proper determination of the basic proportions, cubic-foot volume per seat, and detailed form of the auditorium structure. — The purpose of this paper is to show that acoustics can be coördinated constructively with the other primary functions of theater planning to develop a more efficient and more economical design and one that truly expresses modern and creative architecture."
"An analysis of sound-picture reproducing-system characteristics, including electrical and acoustical response data collected in the interest of determining the possibilities involved in obtaining an average characteristic for reproducing various film products with uniform response over several combinations of loud speaker equipment. With the aid of a curve tracer having a long-persistent cathode-ray screen, a photographic record was made of the characteristics, starting with various forms and amounts of equalization and exploring their relationship to the power-handling capacity of amplifiers. Following through the system, this record shows the characteristics of dividing networks under various conditions of load, and finally the acoustical response curves taken for comparison of the loud speaker equipments under study. — The measurements of loud speaker combinations included various types of units, both permanent-magnet and energized, low-frequency horns ranging from open back baffles to folded horns with specially designed rear-loading compartment, and high-frequency multicellular horns of various configurations and constructional details. — After establishing the natural characteristics of the various equipments involved, careful listening tests were made over an extended period with samples of commercial prints and other recordings. A description follows of the difficulties and problems involved in an effort to obtain one overall characteristic, which would give satisfactory reproduction for all types of material. The final results are shown, with a short discussion of the methods for duplication in other equipment combinations, and conclude with recommendations for future designs and ratings."
"The addition of practical operational accessories lo standard recording channels as purchased expedites operation and saves time. At the Eastern Service Studios a number of such accessories have been designed and are described briefly. It is the purpose of this paper to show what has been done at one studio in the hope that it may be of some interest and help to others who are engaged in recording work. — Included in the equipment are the following items: A small collapsible, portable microphone boom for location work; a special microphone suspension to prevent mechanical noises from getting into the recording system; a small mixer console for stage work, to permit the miner man to operate close to the scene of action; an accurate illumination meter, using a microammeter, for setting and checking the recording machine exposure; a compact re-recording mixer console equipped with equalizers, effect filters, amplifiers, and attenuators; a projected volume indicator and footage counter for use in re-recording rooms; a film playback adapter for use on a Western Electric film machine for location use; playback horns for stage and location use; and an air-brush adaptation for blooping re-recording tracks."
"Here and there a theater is planned with lighting features utilizing the fundamental principles that have been expounded on many occasions. In too many cases, however, interior lighting has lagged far behind exterior lighting for advertising, and owner and public alike have suffered. In too many cases, also, the theater falls far short of complementing the attractive scenes so well projected upon the screen. — This paper reiterates the aims and advantages of proper lighting, and outlines the problem of locating, and controlling the lighting properly so that it will be comfortable and pleasing and an aid, psychologically."
"(As a result of additional tests and consideration of field operating conditions, these Revised Specifications are recommended to supersede the original Specifications of March 31, 1937, and the subsequent Specifications of June 8, 1937.)"
"The editors present for convenient reference a list of articles dealing with subjects cognate to motion picture engineering published in a number of selected journals. Photostatic copies may be obtained from the Library of Congress, Washington, D. C., or from the New York Public Library, N. Y. Micro copies of articles, in magazines that are available may be obtained from the Bibliofilm Service, Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C."
"One of the fundamental advantages of the variable-area system is that the original negative may be reproduced directly without appreciable wave-shape distortion. One printer operation can be eliminated and the film noise considerably reduced by originally recording a track in which the transparent area diminishes as the recorded level is decreased. A direct positive recording system has been so designed that the recording and noise-reduction light-beams are separated in the direction of the film motion. This allows the noise-reduction system completely to anticipate a coming signal, thereby eliminating clipping. When the sound volume is less than is required to fill the track, the noise from the direct recording is reduced further by additionally exposing those portions of the track not needed for the sound-waves. A single shutter vane automatically controls both the transparent area and the additionally exposed area. — A model of the direct positive optical system has been on test in Hollywood for several months. The exposure has proved to be less critical than on the negative-print process. Densities from 0.80 to 1.60 produced only minor quality differences. A good print of a negative compares favorably in quality with a direct positive record, but because of the variations always present in the printing operation, it is believed that a higher average of quality can he maintained from the direct record."
"At the New York World's Fair 150 versions of a fifteen-minute story are carefully sorted to bring each to only four persons seated in comfortable chairs on a moving conveyor. — A verbal description of a diorama along the edge of which the conveyor progresses, carefully synchronized with the motion of this conveyor, is given each group of persons and is repeated to each succeeding group with approximately a six-minute lag. In telling the fifteen-minute story, approximately 150 versions are being repeated simultaneously, each version differing only in its starting time. — In considering possible ways of meeting the elaborate requirements established for this sound system, various combinations of disk, film, and steel-tape reproducing apparatus were considered, a novel form of film reproducer being selected primarily on the basis of proved operating reliability over long periods of time. — The Polyrhetor consists essentially of a rotating steel drum eight feet in diameter capable of carrying 24 continuous film loops past 168 optical scanners and associate amplifiers mounted on seven posts equally spaced about the drum. A multiple system of sectionalized trolleys conveys the sound through sliding contactors to small speakers in the cars, around which sufficient acoustical partitioning is provided to avoid Program interference from car to car."
"This paper gives a general analytical theory of reproducing variable width records with oblique images. Two types of records are considered. In each case the effect of obliquity is to introduce non-linear distortion and loss of power; but the amount of distortion produced and its dependence on the modulation are different in the two types of records. The loss due to the width of the image is practically independent of the orientation of the reproducing image. Curves are given which show the amount of distortion produced by an error of orientation of 43 minutes when the width of the sound-track is 0.080 inch."
"The usefulness of chemical analysis as a supplement to sensilometric data is emphasized. Distribution ratios for hydroquinone and mitol between water and ether are given as functions of sulfite concentration and pH. A new analytical method is presented for the determination of metol and hydroquinone in a photographic solution where the developing agents are “salted out” of the solution at the proper pH by means of sodium thiosulfate and determined volumetrically by titration with iodine. A modified Volhard method is presented for the determination of soluble bromide where the interfering substances are removed by treatment with hydrogen peroxide."
"The motion picture today is the legacy of experimentation of the past. From the still camera to the movie camera, man moved into new realms of record and drama. Thus was evolved the fade-out, the close-up, special lighting, dissolves, and process shots. We had the Melies, the Lumiè, the Griffiths, and the deMilles contributing to early production technics. — The documentary is one of our oldest movie forms, for it means factual photography with the impact of drama. The documentalist takes real people in real places. The 15 years from Flaherty's Nanook of the North to Lorentz's The River represent years of advance in engineering; but those working in the medium recognize many unsolved problems of sight and sound. — The problems of modern life open exciting possibilities for both the producer and the engineer—problems that will mean new developments in the science of the motion picture. We have great frontiers ahead in the production of documentaries on housing, recreation, the business of food distribution, the problem of raising and obtaining food, communications, the conservation of natural resources, the backgrounds of war—all these offer a challenge to both the engineer and the producer, for in working together they will contribute much to a great art and a great science—the modern motion picture."
"The purpose of this paper is to deal with a very specialized phase of the motion picture industry; that is, its hazards of fire and consequent accident, as due not solely but chiefly to the prevalent use of nitrocellulose film. Consideration is given to the causes of hazards and an attempt made to show that they are real and what is being done about them. — The many organizations and groups concerned with and supporting the cause of fire prevention and protection in the industry are described briefly as to their basic organization and methods, and are then correlated. — As distinguished from the recommended Regulations of the National Board of Fire Underwriters and the National Fire Protection Association, which in general specify the safe methods of installation and use of needed safeguards for apparatus and equipment in the field, the Standards of Underwriters' Laboratories specify the safe construction and performance of apparatus and equipment, and are applied and “policed” in the producing factories. — The paper concludes with a discussion of some of the underlying considerations affecting the Standards of Underwriters' Laboratories as applied to projectors, rewind machines, sound amplifiers, speakers, etc."
"During the Canventions of the Society, symposiums on new motion picture apparatus are held, in which various manufacturers of equipment describe and demonstrate their new products and developments. Some of this equipment is described in the following pages; the remainder will be published in subsequent issues of the Journal."
"The great interest that the problem of optimal screen brightness holds in motion picture engineering is proved by the numerous researches on the subject in recent years. Besides the very interesting American papers published in this Journal, some recent German works are worthy of consideration. — In 1936 Zimmermann determined the dependence of the visual effect upon the screen brightness and found that a maximum value is attained at about 14 foot-lamberts. He investigated also the influence of light distribution, and temporary brightness changes. Finally he pointed out that the time the eye needs to see all recognizable contrasts varies, according to the brightness level, between 1/3 and 1/10 second. — In 1936 Rieck verified, under conditions similar to those in cinema theaters, the character of the contrast-sensibility relation that Brodhun and König had found in their classical research. — Very recently H. Frieser and W. Münch reported results obtained by projecting a detail test-object. They determined the contrast threshold function under conditions very similar to those of actual projection. They did not find a material increase in the number of distinguishable contrast steps for picture brightnesses exceeding 10 foot-lamberts. — It is to be hoped that the consideration of the results of (111 these investigations will form a basis for early temporary screen brightness standardization."
"A 16-mm. developing machine designed for installation in loft buildings without disturbing overhead ducts and piping is described. The machine is ruled at 150 feet per minute. A detailed description is given of the constructional features of the equipment and its control."
"A description of the features of chromium-nickel stainless steels that make these alloys useful as corrosion-resisting materials, and how they are influenced by the several alloying elements commonly present. — Chromium is shown to benefit corrosion-resistance by the formation of inert films that prevent progressive attack. Data are presented to illustrate the effect of nickel in increasing the stability of the alloys and in supplementing the effects of chromium. The usefulness of molybdenum in improving corrosion-resistance under both oxidizing and reducing conditions is pointed out. Illustrations are given of its beneficial effects in connection with specific corrosives. — Included also is a discussion of intergranular corrosion, and the effects of carbon and stabilizing elements on this phenomenon."
"The first part of the paper deals with the determination of the minimum amount of sound absorption necessary in a room so as not to produce a space interference node at a certain distance from the loud speaker when that is emitting a steady tone. Two cases are investigated—the amount of sound absorption necessary in the room that will make it impossible to find a node within a given distance from the emitter; and the amount of sound absorption in the room that will make it improbable to find such a node within the same given distance from the emitter. — The second part of the paper deals with the minimum amount of sound absorption necessary in a room so as not to produce time interference nodes during the decay of a tone in the room. Here again two cases are considered-the amount of sound absorption necessary to make it impossible to produce nodes during decay; and the amount of sound absorption as mill make it improbable lo produce such a node in the room."
"Problems are described that were encountered during the production of several motion pictures with sound for the New York State Department of Health. These films represent a type that has found new uses in instructing physicians and nurses, as well as the general public, in the treatment of pneumonia patients, as a purl of a nation-wide campaign program against the spread of pneumonia."

"This report of the Progress Commitee covers the period June, 1938, to April, 1939. The advances in the cinematographic art are classified as follows: (I) Cinematography: (A) Professional, (B) Substandard; (II) Sound Recording; (III) Sound Reproducing Equipment; (IV) Television at the Close of 1938; (V) Publications and New Books; (VI) Appendix A: The Motion Picture Industry in Japan."
"American motion pictures continued to enjoy widespread popularity throughout the world during 1938, although the intensification of difficulties abroad has resulted in a drop of 70 to 65 per cent in America's domination of the world's motion picture screens. The obstacles encountered have been of diverse character, including legislative restrictions, quota systems, high taxes, foreign-exchange controls, occasional excessive censorship, so-called “racial” theories, fervent efforts to build up local film industries, active hostilities in the Far East and Spain, transfers of territories, and such intangible factors as uncertainty and apprehension. — Various significant legislative enactments occurred during the year in Europe. Great Britain imposed a new quota system, to last for 10 years. Notwithstanding the erection of new barriers, American films have continued to enjoy a substantial European market. — During 1938, foreign motion picture production totaled 1706 feature films, against I809 in 1937. The countries of the Far and Near East led in production. with 967 features, as compared with 959 in 1937. Production in Europe fell off sharply, the total for all Europe being only 609 features. Latin-American feature-film production increased by 40 films to a 1938 total of 130, Mexico being the largest producer, with 60 features. — The Latin-American market at present appears to afford a promising opportunity to offset the restriction of our picture markets in other parts of the world. — Spanish-dialog films have scored notable box-office successes in nearly every Latin-American country in which they have been shown locally produced pictures having often exerted a powerful appeal during the past year, because they have portrayed familiar aspects of life, in a language understood by the audiences. On the other hand, a wealth of recent evidence demonstrates the grave defects and difficulties of the motion picture production attempted in certain countries abroad on wholly insufficient foundations."
"During the past year a special triple-head projection mechanism has been in use at the Paramount Studio for transparency process work. This device permits the projection of three separate background positives, through three separate projection heads, superimposing the images upon a single screen to form a single registered image of greater size and brightness than would otherwise be possible. — The general construction, use, and applications of the device are described."
"Consistency in negative printing values is one of the most desirable factors in modern cinematography. Photoelectric light-measuring devices help the cinematographer maintain such consistency to a far greater degree than is possible otherwise. — Several requirements in these devices must he recognized, among which are freedom from error and photocell fatigue, changes in humidity or temperature, and the like, and good uniformity. — While these requirements are not wholly met in existing meters, it has been found possible to use such meters to advantage. Coördination is effected by use of a special, portable testing unit of the photometer type. Further developments should include complete acceptance of strict time-and-temperature methods of negative development and some form of automatic, photoelectric-cell-controlled print-timing. This would remove all variables from the processing problem, and leave the responsibility for results solely in the hands of the cinematographer."
"Practically all precision sound-truck measurements are made with a microscope, which has been the accepted standard in the industry. This method is necessarily slow, and in an effort to speed up track position, printer alignment, and other technical measurements, a projection microscope has been developed. Using equipment available at a reasonable cost, a projection microscope which can he used by anyone in the sound and laboratory departments has been developed and is herein described. — One of the most important advantages of the instrument is its ability to detect printing machine defects, and by its use the quality of sound printing has been greatly improved."
"Direct recording is becoming commercially more and more important. Acetate blanks are used for high-quality recordings, but these materials are essentially softer than pressed records, and therefore make necessary new considerations in the design of high-quality pick-up to be used with them. — It is shown that a dynamic stylus pressure of approximately 25 grams is the maximum force that acetate can tolerate without permanent deformation of the modulated grooves, even when due consideration is given to the proper matching of stiffness and inertia of the vibratory system of the pick-up. — A simple formula is given for the most suitable condition of the matching of inertia and stiffness for a complex wave-form. Other factors that interfere with the construction of a light pick-up, such as uneven record and turntable surfaces, are explained, and suggestions are made for the reduction of these effects. — The advantages of “constant amplitude” as a method of recording and reproduction are shown, and a constant amplitude system is demonstrated."
"The editors present for convenient reference a list of articles dealing with subjects cognate to motion picture engineering published in a number of selected journals. Photostatic copies may be obtained from the Library of Congress, Washington, D. C., or from the New York Public Library, New York, N. Y. Micro copies of articles in magazines that are available may be obtained from the Bibliofilm Service. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C."
"A new dubbing (re-recording) and scoring (music recording) building recently completed on the Republic lot consists of a recording stage, scoring monitor room, machine room, projection booth, power room, maintenance room, and a recording truck testing platform. — The recording equipment consists essentially of two complete RCA high-fidelity recording channels, together with their associated equipment of film recorders, film phonographs, amplifier racks, power rectifiers, dubbing and scoring consoles, “acetate” recorder and projection equipment. — The stage is of the live-end-dead-end type, and has dimensions which conform to the recommended 1:2:3 ratio. The live-end is provided with permanent side wall and ceiling reflecting panels which increase the reverberation and diffusion of sound. The remainder of the stage is treated with 4-inch rockwool battens, placed between the studs and retained in place by a dual muslin covering. The measured reverberation characteristic of the stage, fulfilling recommended requirements, is between 0.95 and 1.00 second for the frequency band of 540 to 7000 cps. The stage is equipped also with an eight-position mixer console so that dubbing may be monitored in a room having approximate theater sound characteristics."
"After describing the constructon of a unidirectonal microphone several desirable factors are discussed connected with the use of such a transmitter for recording sound in motion picture studios. Six illustrations show how the microphone may he used to advangate under specific set conditions, and four diagrams illustrate its use in recording various types of music."
"In the recording, acoustical, and electrical transmission of sound, the control of reverberation for purposes of speech articulation, musical quality, and acoustic illusion has been one of the problems confronting architects, broadcasting, recording, and acoustic engineers for some time. The paper discusses briefly the phenomenon of reverberation, and describes two methods of reverberation control: (1) reverberation chambers and (2) a practical machine employing magnetic recording."
"From the earliest days of artificial lighting the broadside type of unit has been a fundamental lighting tool. Regardless of the light-source used in such lamps—whether mercury-vapor tubes, carbon arcs, or incandescent filament globes—the broadside is a lamp of the floodlight type, designed to emit a relatively wide flood of soft, moderately powerful illumination. It has withstood innumerable changes in lighting and photographic technic, including the introduction and acceptance of spotlighting, the change from orthochromatic to panchromatic film. the changes from silent to talking pictures and from arc to incandescent light-sources, and the present growing popularity of natural-color photography. — The paper traces the evolution of arc broadsides only, and comment upon the design and performance of the early units. The evolution of the broadside is followed through successive improvements in silent-picture usage; its decline at the introduction of sound and Mazda lighting; through the relatively recent rebirth of arc lighting due to the requirements of modern natural-color photography; and the most recently introduced units of this type which are replacing equipment designed less than jive years ago at the introduction of the three-color Technicolor process. Comparison is made between the early, intermediate, and modern units as regards color distribution, light distribution. steadiness and length of burning period, indicating that though less public attention has been given to these types than to the more familiar spotlighting units, the broadside has kept pace with advances in lighting and equipment design."
"Some experiments on the toning of motion picture positive him by the methods of direct dye coupling color development, which have heretofore been applied principally to natural color processes, are described. Also methods of obtaining a wide range of colors and of controlling contrast are discussed. — Also methods of obtaining a wide range of colors and of controlling contrast are discussed."
"During recent years an important problem in major-studio cinematography has been that of following focus. Due to the shallow depth of field in modern lenses when used at maximum apertures, it is necessary to alter the focus frequently during the filming of a scene. In moving-camera shots, which are being used with increasing frequency, this problem is naturally aggravated, since both camera and players may move. The use of “blimped” cameras for sound pictures also aggravates the cameraman's problems. as finder parallax is greatly increased by placing the finder outside the camera “bungalow.” — At the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studio these problems have been simplified by the use of the semi-automatic follow-focus device. This consists of a finder which is both focused and pivoted to correct for parallax as the lens is focused. Individual cams coordinate the finder movement with the characteristics of any given lens."
"The a-c. interlock motor system used to drive cameras, recording, rerecording, and projection machines in synchronism has special advantages in such applications as driving projector and camera for projection background process. The system is generally started from a central point, such as the recording room, and the cameraman does not have means for running his camera independently as is so often required for photographing slates, exposure tests, and silent scenes. — An addition has been made to the system to give it the advantages of the synchronous motor system: namely, the facilities enabling the cameraman to operate his camera at will at regular speed. The addition consists of a set of relays with control circuits, and a frequency-changer and field-exciter set. Normally, the camera motors are connected to the common interlock system through the relays. If, however, the button provided at the camera is depressed, the pilot relay operates the main relays which transfer the camera motor circuit to the bus of the frequency-changer and field-exciter set. One phase of the rotor is short-circuited, and the remainder is excited with direct current and serves as the field. The three-phase stator is supplied with three-phase power of a frequency that will cause the motor to run at the required speed, the same speed as when driven with the interlock system. — The power developed by the a-c. interlock camera motor when operated as a synchronous motor is approximately the same as under normal operating conditions. The acceleration is typical of small synchronous motors when the power supply is suddenly connected. The pull-in torque is superior to the slotted-rotor type of as-synchronous motor. The operation of the system is smooth, simple, and efficient, and has, after several years of use, proved its value."
"A New wind-machine has been adopted and use for several years with a great improvement realized. It is a centrifugal blower, such as is commonly used in ventilating systems. The air is conducted by canvas ducts to the set where the scene is being enacted. The ducts are equipped with variously shaped fillings and nozzles so that the air stream may be directed as desired. — It has been found expedient to locate the blower outside the stage building and enter the duct through a special portal. Thereby the greatest noise source, the blower, is remotely located and insulated from the scene by the walls of the stage building. Furthermore, it incidentally serves as a ventilator, suppplying fresh air to the scene. Measurements of noise-level for various wind velocities indicate improvements up to 70 decibels in noise reduction. Thus sound recordings of scenes requiring wind are made possible where heretofore it was necessary to photograph the scene without sound and provide synchronized sound subsequently."
"In furthering developments in process projection equipment and technology, the Research Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is carrying out its fundamental purpose of assisting to achieve new production economies and furthering technical progress."
"The early history of the standardization of electrical characteristics and the preparation of the first version of the Research Council Theater Sound Test Reel is detailed. Performance specifications and methods for using the various types of Standard Multi- Frequency Test Reels, Warble Frequency Reels, Buzz Track, Scanning Illumination Test Track, Standard 7000 and Standard 9000-Cycle Film, and Balancing Films are enumerated. — Current activities of the Committee on Standardization of Theater Sound Projection Equipment Characteristics, including current investigations toward specifying a Standard Electrical Characteristic for the Simplex 4-Star Sound Systems, are outlined. General recommendations for adjustment of theater sound equipment, in the light of the Committee's experience, are recounted, and in conclusion, the cooperation of the theater service and equipment groups in commenting upon the Committee's Theater Standardization activities and submitting suggestions for further consideration is requested."
"In the improvement of sound motion pictures, the trend has been to make the response of all parts of the recording and reproducing circuits as nearly “flat” as possible. In some cases, however, this has resulted in unnatural sound, and therefore certain empirical practices have been adopted in the studios and theaters to make pictures sound best. — This paper describes the results of a study the purpose of which has been to evaluate the factors which effect the quality of speech as recorded and reproduced, from the vocal cords of the actor on the sound-stage to the brain of the listener in the theater. The characteristics of the various factors have been determined and combined with dialog, voice effort, and other equalizers designed to produce an overall characteristic “subjectively flat” at the brain of the theater patron. These factors, as well as others which are now in the process of being studied, are presented in this paper. — One of the most important characteristics studied is that of the change in voice quality with a change in the effort on the part of the speaker. This is described in detail in this paper. The stage and set acoustic characteristics, microphone characteristic, and dialog equalization to compensate principally for tire hearing characteristic of the average theater listener, are among the factors described herein."
"Several types of non-linear distortion in variable-density recording are discussed and methods of measurement outlined. The two-frequency intermodulation method is described. Mathematical and experimental relationships between per cent intermodulation and per cent harmonic distortion are established. The intermodulation method is applied to film processing for the determination of optimal negative and positive densities and overall gamma. Variances of these parameters from those indicated by classical sensitometry are traced to halation in the emulsion and to processing irregularities. The uses of special anti-halation emulsions appear to reduce residual distortion effects and tend to bridge the gap between intermodulation and sensitometric control values."
"The editors present for convenient reference a list of articles dealing with subjects cognate to motion picture engineering published in a number of selected journals. Photostatic copies may be obtained from the Library of Congress, Washington, D. C., or from the New York Public Library, New York, N. Y. Micro copies of articles in magazines that are available may be obtained from the. Bibliofilm Service, Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C."
"The purpose of this paper is to present o series of curves showing: the photographic control of variable-area sound-tracks in commercial production at Warner Bros. Studio, and to show the wide tolerances in film processing permissible with Class A push-pull recording, a factor that is of especial interest in daily production. — The results of a study of the technic involved in fine-groin photographic duplicating of variable-area sound-track, for foreign release are also discussed."
"Recent advances in design, and in materals of which the recording disks are composed, have resulted in improved fidelity. Both the volume range obtainable, and the frequency range, have been extended, satisfying present-day requirements of motion picture and broadcast applications. — For reproduction, there is provided a new light-weight lateral pick-up having high sensitivity and equipped with a permanent diamond point. This reproducer, in combination with its associated circuit, is suitable for use on all lateral cut disk records. — Pre- and post-equalization are employed in making high-fidelity records, insuring a low noise level. This reduction of background noise together with the wide frequency range and low distortion create an illusion of realism or “presence” during reproduction. — Usually a large number of playings is not required from direct playback disks. However, because of the low mechanical impedance of the new RCA pick-up and the improved composition of the disks, it is possible to reproduce many times without appreciable increase in noise or distortion."
"January 7, 1939, marked the centenary of the day when Arago communicated to the French Academy of Sciences news of the invention by Daguerre of what was to be known as the daguerreotype. — At the suggestion of the Société Française de Photographie that ceremonies and meetings be held by scientific and engineering bodies throughout the world to commemorate this Centenary, the Atlantic Coast Section of the SMPE devoted its January, 1939, meeting to two presentations: the one that follows, by Edward Epstean, describing the historical background of Daguerre's time, as related to photography, or “light writing”; and the second by Beaumont Newhall, describing more an detail the work of Daguerre and his process."
"Taking motion pictures of celestial phenomona that show change is not as simple as it would first appear. Work on spectroheliokinematography was started in 1928, and in 1931 the instrumentation was donated to the University of Michigan by the founders of the McMath-Hulbert Observatory. — The combined tower telescope and spectroheliokinemalograph of this observatory. now one of the most powerful pieces of solar apparatus in the world, is described and some of the solar data obtained with it are discussed."
"Music is a study that is primarily an art; its scientific aspects have been recognized since ancient days. An outline is given of the physical basis of harmony upon which in turn are based the musical scales. A short outline of the historical development of the modern scale is included, the discords produced in the tempered scale due to natural harmonics and summation and difference tones being noted. In the electronic instruments the musical tones can be generated as such in the first instance, or may be produced as a synthesis of pure tones; instruments embodying these principles are described briefly. A method of the synthesis of musical qualities is described, and at the presentation of the paper, such tones were demonstrated using the Hammond (electric) organ, the wave-forms being shown on an oscillograph. — In conclusion it is suggested that the possibility of removing the limitations of the traditional keyboard instruments gives an opportunity of abandoning the tempered scale in favor of the just scale."
"The recent advances in color photography have made more apparent than ever before the need for some simple and accurate method for the estimation of the color-temperature of light-sources. Photographers, Whether professional or amateur, are only too well aware of the influence which the quality of the illumination has on the color rendering of photographic subjects. For example, the difference in color-temperature between general-purpose tungsten filament lamps, and studio modeling lamps, or between modeling lamps and photoflood lamps, is often the. deciding factor between correct and incorrect photographic Color reproduction. In order that the photographer may easily determine the quality of lighting which he is using and make the proper adjustments to secure standard lighting conditions, an instrument that is at once compact, simple in operation, and accurate, has been developed in these laboratories. No auxiliary light-source is required for making measurements since each source is tested by means of the radiant energy which it itself emits. In this paper a discussion of the principles applied in construction of the instrument, a description of the instrument, and data showing the probable error of results are given."
"The maintenance of developer activity over a long period of time is among the most important problems of a motion picture laboratory. The developer is oxidized by the silver halide in the emulsion and by air. When known amounts of these two oxidizing materials react with the developer, simple calculations (presented in a previous paper) are sufficient to determine the equilibrium condition of the developer as well as the replenisher formula to give a chosen equilibrium. Under ordinary conditions there are large variations in the amount of developer oxidation. A chemical analysis immediately detects any deviation from the correct equilibrium and permits readjustment of the replenisher formula. Chemical analyses are presented which require a minimum of equipment and time. In most cases ease of manipulation and speed have been considered as more important factors than a high degree of accuracy but in all cases the methods are capable of giving results to an accuracy of five per cent or better. Whenever possible the analyses are colorimetric in nature, the measurements being made on an instrument called an opacimeter. One opèrator can make a complete analysis in about half an hour. Analysis for any one constituent may be made in a much shorter time. It is emphasized that no one control variable is significant for specifying the activity of a developer. Sensitometric curves are included demonstrating the time lag in pH equilibrium but not in photographic equilibrium when hydroxide is added to or released in the developer. The aim of chemical control is to insure a constant condition of the developer and thus constant photographic quality, rather than to determine the degree of development."
"The opacimeter is an optical instrument designed to measure the light-transmission of a colored or turbid solution. A Loewenthal photronic type light-sensitive cell connected to a microammeter is used to measure the intensity of the light transmitted by the solution under test. The light-intensity falling on the sensitive cell is kept within a fixed range by varying the distance of the cell from the source. The instrument is arranged so that a 30-cc. test tube or a 300-cc. Kohle flask may contain the reaction mixture. The results of analyses are determined from calibration curves prepared from known solutions."

"L. J. Berberich (1) prepared a review of progress in electrical insulation, as achieved by the combined efforts of physicists, chemists, and electrical engineers. Data are reviewed on: The relationship between power factor stability of oil-impregnated paper and the degree of refining received by the oil; an oxygen balance for oil aged in a closed vessel; the gas evolution from several oils subjected to electric discharge, as influenced by degree of refining; and the influence of adding aromatics on the gas evolution."
"Among the modern methods being used to aid in the correlation of observed chemical and physical behavior of matter with the existing information concerning the structure of molecules the dielectric constant and conductance studies have made possible fuller theoretical and practical understanding of both simple and complex substances. Such added knowledge particularly on the electrical behavior of matter is of special value to the field of electrical insulation not only in the selection and processing of superior insulation material but also in the interpretation of phenomena observed with insulation material now in use under various conditions. Nearly every set of dielectric constant or conductivity data, particularly on insulation material, involves some aspect of anomalous dispersion."
"Two amongst many comprehensive reviews written on developments in insulating materials are one by J. F. Gillies (1) and another more recent one by H. Warren (2). The latter includes a table of the plastics and resins available at present, with their chemical constituents and trade names. There is also included data concerning the power factor and permittivity of these end other insulating materials,"
"The past year may very well be regarded as the coming of age of the so-called synthetic rubbers. It has been a year of technical advances in the design of these materials as well as in the solving of the engineering difficulties involved in their commercial production. The National Defense Program has undoubtedly accelerated this activity but progress in this direction was inevitable."
"Progress in plastics during 1940 has been primarily in the improvement of present commercial types and the perfection of methods of fabrication. Only one new plastic, melamine-formaldehyde, was announced in full scale production during the past year."
"In a paper concerning important properties of electrical insulating papers by H. H. Race, R. J. Hemphill and H. S. Ehdicott (1) information concerning the types of papers commonly used in electrical apparatus and typical data concerning some of their physical and chemical properties are presented along with a description of test methods used to evaluate and control these properties. It is pointed out that the desired electrical properties are directly dependent upon the physical and chemical properties incorporated into the paper by the maker. Power factor is said to be one of the most important characteristics of capacitor paper and methods of measurement and calculation of the power factor of impregnated paper are described. The conclusion is reached that the dielectric loss in impregnated paper depends upon the dielectric loss in the paper and on the relative dielectric constants of impregnant and paper but ordinarily not on the power factor of the liquid impregnant. In these calculations the assumption that the paper and the impregnant act in series most nearly fits the experimental results, there are, however, little understood effects resulting from adsorption of polar molecules by the cellulose which are difficult to calculate."
