"Two methods of cancelling the surface reflections of dielectric lenses are described. The first utilizes a simulated quarter-wave matching layer, and the second a reactive wall embedded within the dielectric. The reactive wall may take a variety of physical forms, such as arrays of thin conducting discs, which have a capacitive reactance, or arrays of thin wires, which have an inductive reactance. Surface matching is obtained when the discs are placed approximately 3/8 wavelength inside the lens, or the wires 1/8 wave-length Curves are presented that show how the reflections at the air and dielectric boundary are reduced for various angles of incidence and polarization when quarter-wave layer and reactive-wall matching are employed. The reactance of the array of discs for waves incident at various angles and polarizations is computed by means of Bethe's small aperture theory, and Babinet's principle. Measurements in waveguide of the reactance of an array of circular discs for various angles of incidence and for both E- and H-plane polarization show close agreement with the theory."
"This paper is concerned with theoretical estimates of wide angle radiation in pencil beam antennas. In reflector type antennas this energy consists of direct radiation from the feed and scattered energy from the reflector. Approximate methods for the evaluation of these contributions are discussed together with their simplifying assumptions. To get some numerical indication, calculations were made for paraboloidal reflectors of different f/D ratios and a class of primary patterns which provide an approximate representation of a great many common feeds. The results are presented in graphical form."
"Flat sheets are sometimes used as microwave reflectors at the top of towers. Calculations are presented showing how these reflectors may produce a system gain rather than a loss, however this gain exists in a qualified sense, as the antenna at the ground level is taken as the gain standard. The reflectors exhibit no gain when the gain standard is an antenna having the same area as the reflector. Reflectors exhibit several characteristics which complicate their use in practice."
"The question is first raised as to how a 'trapped' wave radiates, and what beam shapes it can produce. The results are compared with the radiation fields produced by conventional antenna apertures. A flush-mounted type of antenna is discussed which utilizes waves trapped in single and multiple dielectric layers. The calculated mode characteristics are in very good agreement with experimental results. By means of phase and amplitude control, it should be possible to design such antennas with a great variety of beam shapes in azimuth and elevation."
"The terminated - waveguide slot antenna consists of a slot cut in the wall of a waveguide terminated in a known load. The gain pattern of such a slot is a function of the waveguide termination and may change markedly for different load values. The slot field can be regarded as composed of two independent field types arising from symmetric and antisymmetric electric field excitations of the slot, respectively; the relative intensities of the two excitations depend on the waveguide termination. Each of these constituent fields has its own characteristic radiation pattern, and the total gain pattern is obtained by superposition. The determination of the constituent slot fields from which the radiation fields may be computed is an extremely difficult task. it is desirable, therefore, to employ a technique which enables one to find the radiated field as a function of the incident field in the waveguide without a detailed knowledge of the slot field."
"The demand for radar antennas exhibiting a narrow beam and low side-lobes has led to the development of the so called Dolph-Tchebyscheff array which optimizes the relationship between beamwidth and side-lobe level. Unfortunately, however, the calculation of the excitation coefficients for the Tchebyscheff array is quite time consuming and tedious for arrays with a large number of elements. The present paper describes a simple approximate method for calculating long Tchebyscheff arrays which cuts the calculating time by 95 per cent for a 40 element array and which does not increase in complexity with the number of elements in the array. Furthermore, sample calculations indicate errors of only 3 or 4 per cent in the excitation coefficients which is tolerable for most practical arrays. In addition, the paper contains a table of all the coefficients for Tchebyscheff arrays computed in the course of antenna development at the Hughes Aircraft Company. The table contains the exact excitation coefficients and the gain values relative to the corresponding uniform array."
"This antenna was originally developed for the Air Navigation Development Board under a U. S. Navy contract. Four equally spaced longitudinal slots in the wall of a cylindrical cavity constitute the radiating elements. The four slots are energized by three independent feeders in such a way that one circular radiation pattern and two figure of eight patterns are obtained. When the antenna is used in conjunction with a goniometer, a rotating limacon pattern results. Intercoupling among the feeders is very low. The antenna is 7 feet high, 15 inches in diameter and weighs 110 pounds. The antenna may be readily tuned with the aid of a calibration chart to any frequenay between 108 mc. and 118 mc. Experience with a number of installations shows that the overall course errors are around ∠ 1.5° although the antenna error itself can be kept down to about one half of this value. The design of the antenna, flight tests and the several sources of course errors are discussed in detail."
"The channel capacity of a communications system which utilizes wave propagation through a time varying medium such as the ionosphere or troposphere is evaluated in terms of the statistical properties of the medium and of the noise. The signal fading in such a system reduces the capacity. Information theory concepts are broadened to include the possibility of multiple reception at spaced receiving sites, and the consequent increase in theoretical channel capacity is computed as a function of the number of such sites. Current practices in the use of diversity reception and directional antennas are examined in the light of these results."
"The scattering of electromagnetic waves by wires and plates is discussed, particularly with reference to new polarization components which appear. The problem of scattering of radiation by a rectangular plate, for arbitrary angle of incidence, and arbitrary direction of polarization, is solved. The problem of scattering by wires is formulated in terms of the current distributions on the wire when center driven, and when driven as a receiving antenna. A relation between the magnitude of the input impedance of a center driven wire and the scattering properties of the wire is given. The use of simple sinusoidal current distributions is shown to give good results for the scattering of wires of length less than a wavelength. The scattering properties of a wire are shown to provide a method for precisely measuring the magnitude of the input impedance of a center driven wire. This avoids the unknown impedance usually associated with measurements on a center driven wire."
"Results of 100 Mc measurements are evaluated in terms of distributions of hourly medians of transmission loss. Transmitters were located at elevations of approximately 6200, 8800, and 14100 feet above mean sea level on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. Receiving sites were located at distances of 230 and 400 miles from the transmitters. Various types of antennas were employed for transmitting and receiving. The results of studies of fading rate and fading range are reported for the 400 mile site by comparing signals received simultaneously on two different antennas. These results are compared to those expected from the application of the tropospheric scattering theory."
"The Central Radio Propagation Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards has been conducting a program of research at frequencies of 418 and 1,046 mc in conjunction with an extensive 100 and 200 mc program of measurements throughout the United States. This research program has revealed many aspects of the frequency dependence of propagation from 100 to 1,000 mc, including the attenuation with distance and the magnitude of signal strength variations. Reception of 1,046-mc transmissions 400 miles from Cheyenne Mountain, Colo. has been found possible at all times. By far the most important factor determining the available signal power available to the receiver in the uhf band is the effective absorbing area of the receiving antennas. This is illustrated by the use of the transmission loss concept in presenting the results of propagation studies. Transmission loss and its variability versus distance will be presented for a number of frequencies in the vhf and uhf bands as derived from the National Bureau of Standards propagation research program and an interpretation of the results will be given in terms of expected service and interference ranges in the uhf band."
"Measurements of direction of arrival as well as polarization have been made on 9.1 mc/s pulsed transmissions over a 1300 km path from Glenville, North Carolina to Lexington, Massachusetts. The vertical and horizontal angles of arrival were required in order to determine the polarization of the downcoming wave from that measured at the receiving site. Therefore, the direction of arrival was measured in addition to the polarization. Equipment for the continuous automatic recording of the information was constructed; the directional data being obtained in the form of two phase measurements, and the polarization data as phase and amplitude ratio measurements. Data were recorded simultaneously for each pulse of the series of pulses arriving for each one transmitted. Samples of the data are shown, and the correlation with the magnetic-ionic theory is discussed."
"The engineering which is incorporated into the FCC Rules is designed to provide a satisfactory administrative tool for station assignment and licensing purposes. With the rapid growth of television, it was found necessary to include in the Rules a national assignment plan based upon avaiable propagation and equipment data and upon estimates of average service areas. The data and procedures used for the development of the mileage spacings employed in the assignment plan; for the development of the propagation curves; and for the estimates of field strengths required for various grades of service are examined and discussed. An appraisal is made of present progress in UHF and of needed technical developments to permit the UHF to provide the necessary service."
"Television transmitting and receiving antennas are components of a major intelligence transfer system only small portions of which are subject to man's control. The information is carried between antennas by propagating waves which are affected by the propagation media. The main propagation phenomena are considered briefly, but not in detail, to point up how wavefront variations occur. These usually are greater at UHF than at VHF and make the large capture area UHF receiving antenna impractical in many cases. The design and effective application of receiving antennas is quickly discussed in the light of these problems. UHF transmitting antenna design is then reviewed. It is approached from the standpoint of requiring an effective Size near the VHF antenna, in order to partly offset the inapplicable receiving antenna. The resulting many wavelength UHF apertures then require new feeding techniques. These are briefly described. It is also pointed out how the resultant high gains require care in application, with perhaps necessary contouring. The manner in which the same FCC curves are used to predict coverage for channels 14-83 as for channels 2-6 despite differences in propagation characteristics is explained. A single set of measured UHF field intensities is shown. In conclusion, adequate-signal UHF results in superb picture quality because of less selective distortion because of the smaller percent bandwidth. Man-made noise is almost nil. It is only necessary for the receiving end economically to approach as near VHF performance as the transmitting end has, and many of the UHF problems will vanish."
"Employing an approximate method the input impedance of a ground based vertical radiator is calculated. The ground system consists of a number of radial conductors buried just below the surface of the soil. The integrals involved in the solution are evaluated, in part, by graphical methods. The final results are plotted in a convenient form to illustrate the dependence of the impedance on number and length of radial conductors for a specified frequency, antenna height, and ground conductivity. It is finally shown that under usual conditions the radiated fields are modified by only a few percent due to the presence of the ground system."

"An acoustic lens combined with a conical horn can be used to obtain a highly directional microphone without some of the disadvantages of the parabolic microphone. The directional characteristics can be calculated satisfactorily if one assumes that the horn provides uniform flooding of the lens aperture."
"The relative advantages of perpendicular versus longitudinal recording have been re-evaluated in term of the electron-beam pickup. It is shown that dc response can be obtained only with perpendicular or transverse recarding, but because of other considerations longitudinal recording appears to be more generally practicable, even though the resulting low-frequency response limit depends upon the extent to which the physical dimensions of the core may , b e increased and the speed of the recording medium may be reducqd. Measurement techniques have been devised to permit study of the magnetic circuit parameters which influence over-all pickup sensitivity; associated studies show the advantages of a core structure having unconventional configuration and physical dimensions. Procedures recentlypresented by other writers for the investigation of factors contributing t o high-frequency loss in conventional heads have been tested with the electron-beam pickup; tape-coating thickness appears to be responsible fm, a decibel loss approximately equal to the total contributed by all other factors. Relatively simple striptype core structures for use with the electron-beam tube have been developed - over-all performance data under typical recording conditions show an output of the order of 0.2 volt and an equalized response range of approximately one to 15,000 cycles per second, plus or minus three decibels, at a tape speed of 10 inches per second."

"A cable-less microphone system has been developed, Designed for general public address use, the system utilizes inductioncoupling between the transmitter and receiver, and requires no license. The subminiature transmitter is completely contained in a stick type microphone housing. It consists of a microphone, a five-tube, printed circuit frequency-modulated transmitter, a self-contained antenna inductor, and batteries, and weighs less than one pound. The system gives excellent performance with operating areas up to 5000 square feet. The development of the system and of the subminiature transmitter is discussed and the performance of the induction system is evaluated."

"A process is discussed, in which a rotaryfield is generated by the speech frequency spectrum. The rotary field deflects the electron current of an oscilloscope, so that the typical polar coordinate pictures appear on the screen. These are substantially independent of fundamental frequency. Successive pictures can be produced by conversion of these polar coordinate pictures. In order to accomplish this one employs a dilsc with a speed of υ/2. Selected parts of the screen picture can be traced through regulation of the intensity. The cartesian pictures are thus also simplified, so that a \"reading\" of speech analysis, this process may also be employed to produce polar and cartesian pictures of brain waves, etc. Moreover, polar coordinate maps can be converted into cartesian coordinates and vice versa."
"In dynamic amplifiers for phonographs, the gain versus frequency characteristics change in accordance with the varying nature of the impressed audio signal. This paper outlines the basic principles of design of such amplifiers for expansion and for background noise reduction purposes. Especial reference is made to the fundamental patent literature in this field."
"Organ music produced in small rooms having little natura1 reverberation can be enhanced by the addition of artitificial reverberation. A direct method of adding the aftersound to the electro-acoustic transducer itself is described. This is a contrast to the more conventional reverberation systems nploying driving transducers, time-delay means, pickup transducers, and mixing and amplifying circuits. Multiply resonant elical medanical delay lines store the energy and radiate it at a later time. In one model the coupling to the transducer is mechanical, .and in the other model acoustical coupling provides a number of practical and acoustical advantages."

"The tremendous surge of interest in \"high-fidelity\" sound during recent years has attracted the attention of many manufacturers in commercial fields peripheral to the manufacture of sound equipment. Recently (and somewhat paradoxically) several manufacturers of musical instruments have attempted to capitalize on \"hi-fi\" interest. It is concluded that the goal of sound reproducer research and development has been to attempt to recreate the original sound. Presumably one-hundred per cent fidelity would be the achievement of perfect reproduction of the original sound. Manufacturers of musical instruments should think this through before paying the high compliment of imitation to their own imitators. A music production system has inherent advantages in quality of performance over music repro· duction systems Gower system noise and distortion, for example). Surely exploitation of such inherent advantages is a more positive and lasting policy for producers of music production equipment than borrowing publicity generated by producers of music reproduction equipment."

Members of the chapter and their families enjoyed a picnic at a nearby park be fo-e the concert. The first half of the conc~rt was played on the large carillon. A 5500-watt aud1o system called the \"Celestron\" is installed in, the same tower as the carillon. The second half of the concert was recorded music played on the Celestron system. After the concert the PGA group was given an inspection trip through the tower installation."

"Describes types of magnetic recording equipment specifically developed for multi-channel recording of data information such as vibration, displacement, pressure, temperature, etc. Equipment has been designed to operate over wide ranges of temperatures, pressures, humidities, accelerations, and vibrations as experienced in aircraft, vehicles, and other adverse environments."
"This paper describes many of the present recording techniques and the limitations of each. Limitations in regard to performance such as frequency response, signal-to-noise ratio, and speed stability are considered from the standpoint of the machine as well as the medium used in the recording process. Many of the present day applications of magnetic recording are discussed, including those of television recording and the application of magnetic recording to seismic exploration."
"This Paper presents a useful \"handbook type\" equation for calculating a suitable self-bias resistor for a class A triode amplifier stage designed for maximum signal output. It is shown also that the loss in gain is six decibels, when the cathode resistor is not shunted by a by-pass capacitor. This information provides a timesaving method for determining the cathode resistor, with only a knowledge of plate resistance and transconductance, and without the necessity of a family of plate characteristic curves."

"A system for recording and reproducing television signals by means of magnetic tape has been developed. This system will accommodate both monochrome and color pictures. For monochrome pictures, two channels are used, one for the video signal and one for the sound signal. These signals are recorded as two tracks on 1/4-inch magnetic tape. For color pictures, five channels are used: video channels for the color signals red, green and blue, the synchronizing channel, and an audio channel. These signals are recorded as five tracks on 1/2-inch magnetic tape. An electronic servomechanism provides the speed constancy required for the reproduction of television signals from magnetic tape. The present tape speed is 30 feet per second. The recorded and reproduced frequency band is over 3 megacycles. There is a description of a demonstration which included side-by-side showing of a direct picture, and the same picture recorded and immediately played back."

"This paper describes a three-gun, tricolor picture tube of basically improved design. Its picture is Presented on phosphors applied directly to the curved internal face of the tube. With a curved screen, a curved mask which is self-supporting is used. The mask and the springs to hold it in place weigh only six ounces. this simple, light, yet rugged structure is mounted directly on the face plate. three small \"V\"-shaped surfaces on the mask rest on three hemispheres molded directly on the glass to locate the mask precisely. No adjustment is required at assembly. The phosphor dots are placed directly on the curved glass face plate by a photographic process, using the individual mask belonging to that tube as a negative. The Screen will exactly register with its mask because they are images of one another. The curved screen face plate serves also to close the envelope just as it does in the black-and-white tube. Advantages resulting from this design are discussed. The improvements mechanical simplicity, ease of manufacture, size, weight, thermal-stability, electron Optics, picture quality, and circuit stability are shown to stem from the use of a spherical mask and a spherical face plate. The performance of a development tube of this design is given. The practicability of alternate forms of this tube including rectangular screen types in rectangular bulbs is examined. The possibility of using much of the conventional factory equipment for black-and-white picture tubes to make this new color tube is discussed."
"This paper describes a new medium frequency (0.3 to 3 mc) PNP transistor compared with previously described units of this type. The new unit (neutralized to eliminate feedback) will give power gains as high as 39 db at 455 kc, 12 db at 10 mc and has an oscillation limit of 40 mc. A noise factor at 1 mc of as low as 3 db is achieved."
"The development of the transistor has provided an active element having important advantages in space and power. As a result, the question arises whether strategic insertion of such active elements in passive networks might lead to interesting results. This paper describes a theoretical analysis, confirmed by experiment, of certain possible network applications of transistors. Four general areas are considered in which transistors are used as follows: to reduce the detrimental effects of dissipative reactive elements, to eliminate the necessity for inductors in frequency selective circuits, to produce two terminal envelope delay structures having zero loss, and to invert the impedance of reactive structures. The conclusion is drawn that judicious interspersion of transistors in a transmission network enables the achievement of performance which would otherwise be unobtainable or uneconomical."
"The tetrode transistor consists of a base pellet, a point contact collector electrode, and two emitter point contacts. Electrical characteristics indicate that the two emitters can be made to operate nearly independently, and in many of the circuit applications one tetrode can replace two point contact triode transistors."
"This paper concerns the general problems connected with the use of electron tubes. We are primarily concerned with obtaining the utmost reliability when vacuum tubes are employed in circuits to perform certain functions in guided missiles. It is first desirable that we define what we mean by \"reliability.\" Unfortunately, each person has his own definition and idea of just what reliability concerns itself with. The following definition has been developed by a committee on reliability set up by the Radio Television Manufacturers Association and probably fits the bill closer than any definition developed up the present time. The definition is: Reliability is a measure of the probability that a device will perform its purpose adequately for the period of time intended under the operating conditions encountered. This definition covers, in reality, almost every conceivable kind of application and it becomes apparent almost immediately that reliability for one type of service may not necessarily constitute reliability for another application at all. This causes much of the confusion which exists in determining reliable operating. conditions for tubes in specific particular applications. This is brought about by the fact that some applications require the tubes to operate for only a relatively short time, say one-half hour; other applications require the equipment to run for twenty-four hours a day for days on end without any operator being within hundreds of miles of the equipment. In this instance, replacements cannot easily be made and therefore the equipment, to be reliable, must operate thousands of hours without any attention."
"This paper will discuss practical problems involved in the application of the RCA 2N32 and 2N33 point contact transistors, and the 2N34 and 2N35 junction transistors. This paper will be devoted primarily to a discussion on the practical application problems of the two junction transistors and in particular the large signal operation of these devices at audio frequencies. Some information on complementary symmetry circuits will also be included."
"Summary form only given, as follows. In special electronic devices a flat, elongated, cathode is required which may be six to eight inches long and 1/8 inch or more wide. For successful operation this structure must be held firmly in position and maintain its geometry. This objective has been achieved by mounting two telescoping U-channels on a sapphire rod and placing the heater in the interspace. The structure is simplified when one channel is replaced by square-cross-section tubing to which the second channel is spot-welded or brazed. The sapphire or ceramic rod is supported at its ends by suitable brackets which permit free sliding of the rod on heating."
"Summary form only given, as follows. Investigations on receiving-type electron tube processing methods were made because of high rate of electroh tube failures experienced in USAF electronic equipment subjected to high temperatures. The tube type selected for these investigations was the 6AR6 tried in two versions, distinguished from each other only by the processing and aging patterns applied. Both versions were subjected to a high temperature life test specified at 300°C bulb temperature. The result obtained was r~lated t.o the processing pattern applied in each of the versions tried. In the case of setting the transconductance slump at the limit of 10 per cent, the 6AR6 procegsed on the sealex exhaust system did not comply with the specified limit. It was found, however, that the 6AR6 subjected to an improved processing schedule was capab~g of complying with the specified limit. In following up these investigations, a project was initiated relating to the design and construction of an improved exhaust equipment incorporating advanced processing features and applicable to full scale electron tube production to be used for USAF electronic equipment operating at high temperatures. This project forms a part of the current USAF electron tube program aimed at continuously improving modern aircraft reliability."

"By considering an oscillator as a regenerative noise amplifier, one can define an output half-power noise bandwidth. This quantity, which can be calculated from the physical constants of the oscillator, is an exact measure of the purity of the oscillator output. A small noise bandwidth indicates a relatively constant output frequency. Calculations show that three general types of circuits have sufficiently narrow noise bandwidths to be useful in highly critical applications. These circuits are (1) a simple regenerative oscillator, (2) frequency-stabilized oscillator, and (3) crystal oscillator-frequency multiplier chain. These systems are compared on the basis of simplicity and reliability, ease of constructions, and stability."
"High power air-cooled tubes require well designed coolers of the extented surface type. Moreover, it is essential to carry these heat transfer design considerations in parallel with the electronic design so that a tube evolves which will operate at its \"electronic\" rather than its \"heat transfer\" rating. The objectives of this paper are to present the factors relating to the heat transfer design of an annular air-cooler of the axial-flow type, it which the extended surface consists of a large number of radial fins. Performance equation derived from basic heat transfer and fluid flow theory are presented; application of the theory is illustrated by a specific design; and the validity of the design method in demonstrated by results of test. Some problems requiring further analysis and experimental work are also considered briefly."
"In extending the upper frequency of operation of point-contact transistors to the VHF region, the device development was paralleled by an investigation of CW oscillator circuitry. This was done because a CW oscillator is a self-contained system capable of accurate analysis. It is therefore a highly suitable tool for studying the electrical characteristics of the transistor in the VHF region. The concept of frequency modulation by alpha cutoff frequency shift originated as a result of this CW oscillator circuitry study. An experimental FM transmitter operating in the commercial FM band was built to demonstrate both this frequency modulation technique and also CW oscillation in the alpha frequency cutoff region. It is the purpose of this paper to describe this transmitter and to show how a single transistor can simultaneously perform all the functions required of a complete FM transmitter."
"It is the aim of this paper to show that the present Information about the response of vhf triodes to signals and to noise can be represented is an equivalent circuit consisting of an equivalent noise emf in series with the input and of an independent equivalent noise current generator with an admittance in parallel to it connected between grid and cathode."

"Values of some of the wave characteristics used in traveling wave tube analysis are presented in the form of curves. These curves include data valid under conditions in which the gain parameter C is finite (with values up to 0.5) and for relatively large values of the space charge parameter QC (up to 2)."
"The paper concerns the results of design and performance of a low power coaxially interdigital magnetron with external coupled cavity. Special attention is given to the problem of wide-range tunability, in the microwave frequency spectrum, using either mechanical or voltage-tuning methods. The basic structure of the magnetron consists of a short, hermetically-sealed section of coaxial transmission line which contains six equally spaced radial vanes extending from the inner wall of the outer coaxial cylinder into six longitudinal slots in the inner coaxial cylinder. The cathode is symmetrically located within the inner coaxial cylinder at the position of the multianode structure. This sealed off multi-anode system is used to excite a TEM mode in an external coaxial circuit. Experimental results on electronically and mechanically tunable operation are reported, with particular emphasis on voltage tuning."
"It is a well-known fact that the attenuation region of the traveling-wave tube is very important to the performance of the tube, particularly with respect to gain and efficiency of the tube which is relatively short in terms of wavelengths. Characteristics of the attenuator in the passive tube have been measured frequently and variations of attenuation and wave velocity with respect to frequency and thickness of coating are known. In the interests of trying to understand the effect of the attenuator on efficiency, we have attempted to make certain calculations of performance of a theoretical attenuator such as is frequently used on certain spirals and the results of such calculations are presented here."

"A brief discussion of several types of CW radar will be given. Emphasis will be directed toward the function of the tube in each of the various radar systems. A detailed discussion of the requirements placed on the CW oscillator for each of the radar systems will be made. Tube characteristics which limit radar performance will be discussed. Some measuring techniques for evaluating magnetrons and klystrons will be discussed."
"The ultimate limit on receiver sensitivity is random noise. In the microwave region where atmospheric and man-made noise are negligible, this elemental random noise comes from thermal agitation and from electron devices. It can be shown that the irreducible minimum noise level is proportional to the effective system bandwidth."
"A method for measuring the spectral distribution of amplitude fluctuations and frequency fluctuations in microwave oscillators is described. The method provides for evaluation of (1) amplitude fluctuations in terms of signal to noise ratio; (2) frequency fluctuations in terms of two parameters: (a) rms deviation; (b) rms rate of change of deviation. In addition, the method permits estimation of the correlation between these two noise components. Some typical results of measurements are described, and certain implications of the effects of system parameters on interpretation of these results are considered. For a specific system, two measurements are shown to be sufficient to determine the effect of frequency noise on system performance."
"A macroscopic theory yielding the significant parameters which describe the coherent and incoherent output of a CW magnetron(e.g., modulation and \"pushing\" factors, bandwidths, carrier and noise levels, modulation indices, etc.) is outlined. Also described is the theory on which measurement of these descriptive parameters depends, as it is closely related to the interpretation of the data from which the defining parameters of the phenomenological model are obtained. It is shown that the most satisfactory general model of CW operation is that of a carrier or primary oscillation simultaneously amplitude-and angle-modulated by a band of shot or \"primary\" noise and accompanied by a background noise essentially incoherent with the modulated carrier. The chief effect is produced by the mechanism of angle-modulation, which even for relatively noisy tubes occurs with a very low modulation index; the amplitude-modulation, while normally weak, can not be neglected and must be included in the analysis. A technique of direct measurement, employing a wave-guide filter and crystal detector for input waves of the above type, is briefly described, and it is shown how the descriptive parameters of the magnetron model may be observed experimentally. Particular attention is paid to the approximations and assumptions involved, and the theory is illustrated with a number of representative data from a standard magnetron; applications of this general approach to other microwave sources are briefly considered."
"For some time the subject of noise generation in magnetrons has been under study in our laboratory. The unmodulated CW magnetron was chosen as the first subject for investigation, because some of the complications of pulsed or modulated tubes are thus avoided. Since any heterodyning method introduces the noise of another microwave oscillator, a method of direct detection has been employed. This method involves the use of a crystal-video receiver for both AM and FM detection."
"Previous methods of analyzing the low-frequency noise spectrum of microwave oscillators have employed the usual scanning-type spectrum analyzer or an arrangement of fixed-tuned filters. The visual presentation of the spectrum analyzer makes high accuracy difficult, while a series of filters does not provide the necessary frequency discrimination. The present system makes use of a chart recorder to present noise level versus frequency as a continuous plot from 0 to 16,000 cycles."
"This paper is concerned with the measurements of the power spectrum of fluorescent tubes in the frequency range between 6-10 kmc. It has two main purposes: to discuss the experimental set-up used for calibrating fluorescent tubes to be used as secondary noise standards; and to study experimentally the law of available noise power of a discharge tube."
"This paper discusses the genesis of noise in vacuum tubes. Simple if not rigorous derivations for various kinds of noise are given, and it is shown how the noise on an electron beam can be characterized. A few simple examples show how particular results can be obtained but nothing involving laborious mathematics is included. The effect of transverse velocities is discussed briefly, but no results are given."
"Preliminary results on the noise behavior in the \"M\" carcinotron are given. The aim of this study was not to construct a low noise oscillator but rather to obtain information concerning the space charge effects in the \"M\" carcinotron. An attempt was made to measure the noise as a function of frequency but no systematic behavior could be found. As a function of anode voltage the noise had more or less pronounced maxima and minima. The noise power varied in a range of 2 or 4 and at some points even in a range of 10. No studies have yet been made to compare measured noise in the \"M\" carcinotron with theoretical results, or to see if the noise is coherent with the sole current noise. Up to now no attempt has been made to construct \"M\" carcinotrons with low noise power."
"The general structure of the tube is shown and a brief description of the electrode disposition given. Variation of noise figure is described as a function of the first anode voltage with beam current as a parameter. The independence of current is pointed out. A plot is shown of noise figure as a function of the perveance of the cathode to first-anode region and the possible significance of the beam shape in this region is described. The variation of noise figure with frequency is described and some results are given on the effect of helix size."
"Using an electronic model which consists of a stream of uniformly charged laminae accelerated in an electron gun, ac velocity and current at the anode will be given in terms of the corresponding quantities at the potential minimum. The physical principles on which the calculations are based will be summarized and possible application of the results to traveling-wave tube noise theory will be outlined."
"A study of the physical mechanism of ion oscillations was begun after the discovery of spurious sidebands in the spectrum of a DC-operated low-voltage reflex klystron which was undergoing development at this laboratory. These sidebands were observed to be as strong as 40 db below 1 mw in some tubes and were separated from the carrier by as little as 0.6 mc or as much as 15 mc, depending on which klystron was examined and what voltages were applied to it. It was observed that the frequency separation and magnitude of the sidebands were a function of the exterior cooling conditions, an observation which suggests a relation between the sidebands and the gas pressure within the tube. It has been recognized 1 that ion plasma oscillations can be a source of noise in microwave tubes; consequently it was decided to build a cylindrical tetrode structure whose DC configuration was similar to that of the klystrons and to study the details of the oscillations."
"A general model is developed for microwave amplifiers of the beam type based on the usual assumptions of a small signal, one-dimensional, single velocity flow of the electrons in the beam. The model includes arbitrary noise smoothing schemes and all amplifiers whose input and output structures have no direct rf connection; the rf coupling is provided solely by means of the modulated electron beam. A klystron, a space-charge wave amplifier, and a traveling-wave tube with a severed helix (or a helix with strong localized attenuation) are all special cases of this model. It is shown that the minimum noise figure of such an amplifier is of the form Fmin=1+2Π/kT|K| [S(z0,w)- K/|K| Π(z0,w) where S(z0,w) and Π(z0,w) are parameters of the beam noise expressed at a cross section z0slightly beyond the potential minimum in the electron gun, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature of the circuit, and K is a constant dependent upon the particular structures used. The dependence of K upon the microwave structures employed is discussed under restrictive assumptions about the loss in the rf structure of the amplifier. Two cases are possible. In the first case, the minimum possible value of K is unity. In the second, K is less than unity. It is shown, however, that in the latter case the available gain, G0, of the amplifier is given by G0=1/1-K"

"Experimental investigations indicate that ultrasound may prove useful for therapy, for diagnosis and for biologic measurement. Ultrasound, although it may be dangerous in unskilled hands, is an excellent agent for the structural heating of living tissues. The term \"structural heating\" is used to denote heating at abrupt interfaces. The living organism presents numerous abrupt interfaces. Ultrasound promises to become a reliable diagnostic tool. Either the transmitted or the reflected ultrasonic energy can be used in this application. Tumors, galls tones, kidney stones, stones in the salivary glands, foreign bodies and abnormal collections of fluid have been located accurately. Preliminary observations on the use of ultrasound for certain biologic measurements are encouraging. Instrumentation for biologic measurement includes ultrasonic flow meters, devices for measuring thickness of same tissue structures and equipment for measuring the viscosity of blood."
"A method capable of detecting microinch displacements of a transducer surface vibrating in the fractional megacycle range has been developed. The dynamic displacements of a vibrating transducer are detected with the aid of a specialized frequency modulation system. The vibrating transducer face is incorporated into the system in a manner such that the center frequency of an oscillator is varied in accordance with the transducer vibrations. The frequency modulation system transforms the frequency, deviations into a corresponding amplitude varying signal. In this way, accurate measurements of transducer vibrations can readily be obtained. The system is inherently capable of detecting transducer displacements with equal facility in either air or a viscous fluid."
"Previous analysis of the equivalent circuit for the ultrasonic delay line wag applied to quartz crystal transducers and a vitreous silica delay medium. The analysis has been extended to evaluate the use of other materials such as magnesium, aluminum, and steel, and to include BaTi03 ceramic transducers. Calculations show the decrease in loss to be expected as the impedance of the delay medium is decreased and conversely the increase in bandwidth to be expected as the impedance of the delay medium is increased. The increase in bandwidth resulting from symmetrical loading of the transducers is also evaluated. Modifications to the equivalent circuits for the case of BaTi03 ceramic transducers are considered. Theoretically losses can be reduced to 10 db or less using the ceramic transducers with a vitreous silica medium. The bandwidth is slightly less than for quartz crystal transducers. However, by utilizing higher impedance materials,. bandwidths approaching 100% should be achieved."
"Ultrasonics is one of the newest tools to be applied to metal cleaning. Through the years, abrasives, soaps, compounded alkaline materials, and solvents have been used to remove soils From metals. Trichlorethylene Solvent degreasing has had a wide reception in industry since its introduction in 1930. The DETREX SONICLEAN PROCESS combines sound energy and trichlorethylene solvent degreasing for metal cleaning. This is accomplished by immersing specially treated barium titanate transducers in chlorinated solvents, producing cleaning results previously unobtainable. Crossrod, conveyorized equipment incorporating constant distillation and filtration of the solvent in the ultrasonic chamber and providing a final vapor rinse and drying is now in use in industrial plants producing as many as 8,000 parts per hour."
"A temperature-controlled ultrasonic solid acoustic delay line designed for radar calibration purposes is described. It has a delay of 24.73 microseconds. ±0.1 microseconds over an ambient temperature range from -25° C to +60°C. It is designed for use at 60 megacycles and has a bandwidth of at least 8 megacycles and a loss not exceeding 60 db. when used with a 150 ohm termination, It gives at least five reflections with no greater than 74 db. loss. A compact form is accomplished by using a thermostatically controlled oven in the form of a plastic encasement around a hermetically sealed metal enclosed delay line. The delay element, of vitreous silica, is held at 50°C with a deviation of less than ±5°C therefrom over the ambient temperature range up to 55°C. Heater power consumption at 115 volts ac is approximately 20 watts during the heating cycle which constitutes about 25% of the time for a 25°C ambient. Life tests on oven units over approximately two years in the ambient range of 23°C to 28°C show variations in temperature at the delay element well within ±2°C. Details of the construction are discussed and performance data on the oven and delay line are shown."
"The flowmeter described in this paper measures the velocity of a fluid by measuring the difference in times of transmission of an acoustic wave in the upstream and downstream directions. The acoustic wave is propagated in the fluid by pressing a barium titanate transducer against the outside wall of the tubing carrying the fluid. The wave is then picked up by a similar transducer acting as a receiver and mounted on the tubing a short distance away from the first transducer The reversal in direction of propagation is effected by interchanging the functions of the two transducers, i.e., making the transmitter the receiver and vice versa. The time measurement is made in terms of the phase difference between transmitted and received waves. The phase difference measured for propagation in one direction is compared with the phase difference measured for propagation in the reverse direction and the difference between these is an indication of the fluid velocity. This difference is measured with a synchronous rectifier. The transducer functions are switched rapidly enough so that, by means of electrical differencing of the two phase measurements, a continuous velocity indication is obtained. Two methods of switching the transducer functions and performing the synchronous rectification have been employed. The first method utilizes a mechanically driven switch and has been described previously.1 The second method uses an entirely electronic system to perform both functions. It is this electronic system that is described in this paper."

Federal Communications Commission definitions and rules applicable to relay station operations are given in the appendix. A relay station is used to extend the range of communication between a radio station and the point with which it is desired to communicate. It may be necessary to install a radio station many miles from the office headquarters in order to obtain the desired radio coverage of the operating area of the power system, or to utilize a natural vantage point such as a hill or mountain."

"The foundations for engineering advance consist of quantitative knowledge of the nature of the need to be served and knowledge of the new principles needed to serve the need. The nature of these foundations for color television, and their possible consequences in other arts are presented."
"Provides a listing of current committee members. Charged by Board of Directors of RTMA to assemble technical data on: 1. Allocation of channels in the ultra-high-frequency band, 2. Procedures which will enable FCC to lift the \"freeze\" on very-high-frequency allocations, 3. Basic standards for development of a commercially practicable system of color television and to undertake such additional work as may be in the interest of providing more adequate television service to the American Public."
"When a signal specification is intended for a public broadcast service, it is vitally necessary to make sure in advance that: 1. It can be fitted into the spectrum (in this instance this means that it be compatible with the present monochrome system). 2. It will give satisfactory service. 3. It can be sent over the networks. Field tests, as opposed to laboratory measurements, with five transmitters and receivers from a number of manufacturers were made to test the NTSC signal specification. While difficulties were found in the field with a number of the earlier proposals, the final signal proposed triumphantly passed all tests and was recommended to the Federal Communications Commission for standardization and authorization of commercial broadcasting."
"This paper considers the modifications required to equations previously derived, when the television system is adjusted to normalize at an arbitrary chromaticity. Color maps for a television system with arbitrary normalizing chromaticities are shown in illustration of the equations."
"In this paper the NTSC encoding specifications are considered including the effect of gamma correction. Color carrier maps are shown for various proposals considered by NTSC. These maps include the effect of gamma correction. The path of a color transition is also discussed and illustrated."
"This paper discusses the way in which bandwidth restriction is applied in the NTSC color television specification to eliminate color \"crosstalk\" in the received picture. The signal which modulates the subcarrier along one axis is limited by a low-pass filter so that along this axis of the color subcarrier double-sideband conditions may be maintained in transmission and reception. The particular choice of narrow-band axis is not important if the only objective is to eliminate color crosstalk. This leaves one free to make the axes choice hinge upon some important characteristics of the human eye. These eye properties are reviewed as they apply to the NTSC signal specification."
"This paper will discuss the constant luminance principle which is used in NTSC color television. The basic ideas involved are developed, and their effect upon the choice of a signal and the design of the receiver is shown. The benefits from the use of the constant luminance principle are indicated."
"The NTSC color television signal specification may be presented mathematically in a variety of ways, each yielding identical total signals but using a number of different components. In this paper, the presentations are in terms of (1) two color-difference signals, (2) camera primary signals, (3) three color-difference signals, and (4) symmetrical components. The formulation of the signal specification when high-frequency components are present in the signal is also considered."
"The paper shows generalized curves of over-all system transfer characteristics measured from the luminance input to the luminance output; including the factors of background control settings at the receiver and of setup at the transmitter. These curves are shown for various pairs of power law characteristics at transmitter and receiver. The methods for translating transfer characteristics into colori-metric transfers are shown. The method is used to determine the colorimetric fidelity of the system, and illustrations are given in terms of CIE diagrams showing colorimetric departures for various background settings. The paper discusses the relationship between television and photographic systems in respect to gamma."
"There are a number of considerations which lead to the final choice of the chrominance subcarrier frequency in the NTSC signal. In addition to the considerations given elsewhere it is also desirable to minimize the visibility of the beats between the sound carrier and the chrominance subcarrier. This requires a slight alteration of the nominal field and line rates over those used in monochrome television."
"In the NTSC signal, in order to achieve minimum interference by the chrominance signal to the luminance information, it is necessary that the subcarrier frequency have a special relationship to the field and line frequencies. This paper discusses the general conditions which are necessary as well as the practical considerations leading to a choice of the subcarrier frequency in the NTSC standards."
"This paper discusses the quadrature cross talk in NTSC color television caused by the transmission of the chrominance information by a vestigial sideband system."
"A description is given of a method which makes possible the transmission of a subcarrier-type color television signal over narrow-band coaxial cables. Luminance detail is limited to approximately 2 mc, while color detail is limited to 0.3 mc."
"The NTSC Revised Signal Specifications include specification of signal component time coincidence and of envelope delay in the transmitted signal which compensate for certain receiver characteristics. The origin of delay errors is briefly discussed along with the means and effects of delay correction."
"The radiated wave form of a fully-equalized color television transmitter is shown in the amplitude range which includes the subcarrier burst and the sync pulses. Three cases of saturated color bar transmission corresponding to different depths of modulation of the RF carrier are analyzed. It is shown that both the subcarrier and the luminance components are altered by the partial suppression of one sideband even in the idealized system. However, saturated colors are not usually present in average color scenes and the current monochrome standards for white level may be adhered to in color transmission. Several sources of incidental phase shift of the subcarrier in the transmitter as a function of the modulation depth are pointed out. Measurement procedures for the determination of incidental phase shift and differential gainare illustrated byactual oscillograms."
"The results of an evaluation of the capabilities of the NTSC color-carrier reference signal (the color burst) show this new color television synchronizing signal to be more than adequate; information inherent to the signal permits performance far in excess of that achieved by conventional circuits. Phasing information inherent to the burst is considered first with particular regard to measures of accuracy, the required amount of integration, and the extent of the spectral region necessary to translate the burst information. Properties of elementary passive and active circuits for using the burst in receivers are described along with a determination of the limits of burst synchronization performance for these circuits. Fundamental considerations in the theory of synchronization show that better performance is obtainable with two-mode systems. Properties of two-mode systems are considered and lead to an evaluation of the limits of synchronizing performance permitted by the color burst. The mathematical derivations necessary to support the discussion are presented in the Appendixes."
"This paper deals primarily with the concept of color space as a three-dimensional representation of the means for specifying color. It shows the relationship between the various sets of primaries used by the NTSC in its mathematical description of its form of color and transmission and points out that the I and Q axes, together with Illuminant C, comprise in themselves a set of primaries in color space. This set has been termed the Transmission Primaries."
"After a brief outline of the relevant colorimetric principles, a mathematical formulation is developed for use in analyzing the colorimetric properties of color television systems. The method is employed to determine properties of three different forms of the NTSC color system, one of these being the standard one. It is shown that color distortion, constant-luminance failure, and monochrome compatibility can be measured and predicted analytically."
"Techniques for spectral and colorimetric measurement of a color television system are described. Two measurements are needed to determine whether the transducers will perform as desired in the NTSC system: first, the spectral taking sensitivities of the color cameras or pickup devices and second, the colorimetric characteristics of the display devices. The techniques to be described herein make use of narrow-band optical interference filters used in conjunction with certain \"red pass\" gelatin filters. Reasonably accurate measurements are obtained from which the colorimetric characteristics of the transducers can be calculated and the over-all color performance determined."
"The addition of color to television has opened a new field of application for the science of color measurement. This paper discusses the need for objective colorimetric measurements in color television, and describes a photoelectric tristimulus colorimeter that has been developed for use in this field. This is an instrument for the objective measurement of chromaticity throughout the color gamut that is sufficiently accurate for general work in color television. The synthesis of the spectral characteristics of the instrument is discussed in detail."
"The image orthicon is the only pickup tube commercially available that possesses the high sensitivity required for color cameras. However, the demands of a color picture are such that the standard image orthicon requires changes in design, processing, and testing in order to fulfill this function. These requirements have led to the development of a special image orthicon for color, the RCA-1854. The operating conditions for the new tube are substantially different from those used in monochrome practice. These new conditions change the performance characteristics of the tube and the character of the reproduced picture."
"Available spectrophotometric and colorimetric data on the colors of skin, hair, grass, foliage, sky, and earth are summarized. Typical reproductions of such colors in Kodachrome and some professional 35 mm motion-picture release prints have been measured and are shown. The results of some judgments for color quality are compared on the basis of these measurements. The results are also compared with previous measurements made on color reproductions in reflection prints. In the case of the reproduction of human skin, the preference seems to be for exact color reproduction in transparencies, although the fact, previously reported, that this is not so in the case of reflection prints, is confirmed by new data. The tolerance for color reproduction is much greater for transparencies than for reflection prints."
"Color photographic film will undoubtedly provide much of the program material for color television. If film is to be displayed to its greatest advantage, the color gamuts of film and television must be effectively evaluated. Exact colorimetric reproduction of natural scenes is neither possible nor necessarily desirable with live television or with projected motion pictures. In the present state of the art, color television reproduced luminance ranges are limited. Better televised film will result if: (1) the effective scene luminance range is modified, either in the film or in the television system, to conform to that available on the kinescope, and (2) kinescope reproductions of film colors are made lighter with increasing saturations. In principle this color-dependent brightness compensation can be accomplished by several methods. One proposed method would require insertion of new equipment in the television film chain. Alternative suggested methods require only modifications of existing television film chain equipment."
"The nature of the \"reproducing primaries\" employed by most subtractive color processes is such that undesirable cross-coupling exists between the various color separation images originally recorded by the taking sensitivities of the film. When using subtractive color transparencies as original material for color television transmissions, the output signals from the pickup device may be thought of as integral density measurements of the film. If the characteristics of the film are known, it is possible to devise an electrical network which will partially remove the photographic crosscoupling. For some types of subtractive transparencies color television reproduction is subjectively enhanced by this procedure"
"This paper indicates four techniques whereby the algebraic manipulations required in a color television transmitte or receiver may be accomplished. Two of these are simple summation procedures, i.e., a common plate and a common cathode-load; two are weighted summations, i.e., a feedback and a passive network."
"The color signal specifications proposed by the National Television System Conumittee are discussed in so far as they apply to the RCA transmitter colorplexer. The principal colorplexer functions of matrixing, band limiting, and delay correction, modulating, burst generating, and mixing are described in considerable detail. Wave forms, photographed at several points in the colorplexer, are shown for one standard color-bar signal."
"A color television system transmits three independent signals, each of which specifies one of the three co-ordinates that determine the location of the reproduced color in a three-dimensional color space. When a color transient occurs, each of these signals responds in a different manner determined by the characteristics of its own channel. The system response may be characterized by the resulting path along which the reproduced color point moves through the color space from its initial to its final location. The shape of such color transient paths as determined by the individual transient responses of the three channels is analyzed, and the subjective appearance of different transient-path shapes is discussed."
"Perfect reproduction of a scene by color television requires that three independent colorimetric quantities be known for each point of the picture. The particular three quantities chosen to be transmitted and the bandwidth assigned to each are among the system variables which must be specified. The optimum choice of these parameters is decided principally by subjective rating of the reproduced color picture with particular regard to color and luminance transitions at boundaries in the picture content. This paper describes an experimental video frequency color television system in which these variables can be isolated and conveniently studied. With this system the make-up of color difference signal packages and their assigned bandwidths are switchable so that an observer can view in sequence and on the same display a picture transmitted utilizing various signal forms. Investigations using this system suggested that certain undesired luminance variations were the most objectionable feature in the reproduction of the color transitions, and led to the development of a means for predistorting the luminance signal to compensate for these variations in the reproduction. This device will be described in the paper."
"To provide information on the relative merits of several methods of gamma correction, three different forms of the NTSC color television system are examined with respect to their ability to reproduce luminance detail. The best system in this respect seems to be one which uses a luminance-corrector in the transmitter, but this system is inferior to the EY1/γ system in several other respects. The EY1 system seems to be the poorest of the three."
"A color-bar test signal is described for verification of the performance of an NTSC color television system. By measurement of the amplitudes and relative phases of a group of bar signals corresponding to saturated primary colors and their complements, it is shown that the basic composition of the multiplexed color signal may be verified. The use of a very simple demodulator for accurate measurement of phase at the 3.58-megacycle subcarrier frequency is also described."
"The reasons for making gamma corrections are briefly reviewed. The need for maintaining linearity throughout the transmission system is emphasized. An instrument is described which enables the user to more conveniently obtain an expression for the degree of nonlinearity and therefore exercise greater control over it. This instrument is based on early proposals made by the I.R.E. Committee on Video Techniques. Wider use of such instruments should prove beneficial to the industry and result in further refinements."
"The development of color television has produced some \"growing pains\" in television system operation. To radiate a satisfactory color TV signal, routine maintenance must include the measurement and adjustment of some characteristics not ordinarily considered for monochrome television. In other cases the accuracy of operation must be considerably better than in the past. This paper describes several test instruments developed to simplify some of these measurements. The first instrument described produces a frequency response test signal. The signal contains the elements necessary for normal operation of clamp circuits so that a rapid check can be made on either a single component or a complete system, including networking facilities. The second instrument was developed primarily for making differential gain and differential phase measurements. It produces a staircase type signal to which sine waves of a selected frequency can be added. The third device is a calibrated phase shifter useful for making accurate phase measurements. The device and a test method are described. This instrument is particularly useful in making precision measurements on system components. The last instrument described is for frequency measurement. The presence of a color subcarrier makes it important to hold accurately the 4.5 mc sound-to-picture separation. The test instrument reads directly the deviation from the correct spacing with an accuracy of a few cycles."
"The signal-delay characteristics proposed by the NTSC for a television transmitter for color provides for the equalization of the delay distortion associated with the high-frequency cutoff of the average receiver. A design for an equalizer is developed with the aid of the potential analogy for all-pass filters."
"This paper describes the measurements and alignment techniques that were used at Television Station WPTZ (Philadelpha) to successfully broadcast a certified NTSC color signal. Certification data were taken using a standard color-bar chart, the phase and amplitude of the color subcarrier being measured with a vectorimeter having a polar display. Additional equipment employed consisted of a wide-band oscilloscope, ten-step staircase generator, frequency burst generator, transmission-line monitor, and a special stabilizing amplifier modified for color operation."
"The advent of television broadcasting in color, in accordance with the standards proposed by the NTSC, will require the application of new techniques and instrumentalities to the network channels which transmit television signals throughout the country. The extent of today's television networks and their continuing growth makes this a job of considerable magnitude. The transmission requirements of NTSC color signals are more stringent than those of monochrome, because additional information is carried in the same video frequency band. The need for closer control is at the upper end of the video frequency band, where the color subcarrier is placed. It appears that additional gain and delay equalizers will be required on all channels and periodic tests and adjustments will have to be substantially increased. On coaxial cable systems, special frequency translators will be needed to shift the color information to frequencies within the coaxial passband."
"Larger kinescopes and the advent of compatible color television have given increased importance to the problem of improving the transient response of television receivers. This paper is concerned with receiver design factors that make for improved electrical fidelity, although the interlocking nature of the transmitter and receiver requires some consideration of the transmitter aspects of the problem. In the receiver, the electrical fidelity is primarily determined by the delay distortion produced in the video IF amplifier, and the extent to which this distortion is compensated in the peaking circuits of the video detector and the video amplifier. Optimum results are obtained by working with both the phase-delay characteristic of the over-all receiver and the corresponding amplitude characteristic. In color receivers, prevention of delay distortion has been found to be of primary importance, as might be expected from the fact that the channel is being used to greater capacity. The factors which determine cross talk between the I and Q color-difference signals and coincidence of the luminance and chrominance information are described. Ultimately, obtaining a uniformly high standard of receiver transient response depends upon industry agreement on a standard monitor. Widespread use of a standard monitor should go far toward eliminating the present tendency for receiver designers to vary their designs to meet the peculiarities of particular transmitters."
"It is shown that the plate output of the synchronous demodulators used in NTSC color television receivers will contain a variety of signals in addition to the desired color-difference signals. Among these are signals representing chromatic distortion due to rectification of the chrominance subcarrier, interference due to the passage of hf portions of the monochrome signal through the chrominance channel, and cross talk due to reaction between chrominance and hf monochrome signals. Estimates are made as to the seriousness of each undesired signal component, and it is concluded that there will be certain conditions under which each might produce a readily perceptible effect."
"The dc quadricorrelator is a new form of automaticphase-control circuit which, when applied to color synchronization, gives better performance and appears easier to manufacture than circuits previously used. It is intended to provide automatic color synchronization without need for a manually-operated frequency or phase control. The circuit combines good noise immunity with rapid pull-in, exceeding the capabilities of widely used earlier arrangements. Its performance and relative simplicity indicate a possible net reduction in over-all receiver cost. The DC Quadricorrelator also provides reliable, noise-immune, automatic switching of receiver circuits for monochrome or color operation. The dc quadricorrelator is a two-mode synchronization system in which the pull-in and hold-in modes of operation are made essentially independent of each other by means of a simple automatic switch. The basic principle, which is presented here in the environment of color synchronization, is also applicable to line and field synchronization for television."
"Circuit techniques for decoding the NTSC color signal to produce three sultaneous color signals, suitable for a three-gun display, are now well known. This paper describes simple circuit techniques for directly processing the NTSC signal at the color receiver to form a signal suitable for a one-gun sequential color display. These circuits fall broadly in two classes, namely, those used to modify the form of color subcarrier signal, and those used to modify the luminance signal. The latter class of circuits generally demodulate some of the color subcarrier signal, and correct the luminance signal in such a manner that constant-luminance operation results."
"Techniques suitable for operation of the single-gun tricolor Chromatron tube with present-day compatible color television standards are presented. The experimental circuits constructed to explore two methods of use are described, along with the results of practical testing of these circuits. A method of correcting for circuit nonlinearity which assures color balance under all situations of light level is discussed, in connection with the problem of adding color-difference information directly into the gun of the picture tube."
"This paper describes the advances made by RCA in the development of a production design for an all glass shadow-mask color kinescope. The constructional features of the early RCA shadow-mask color kinescope are reviewed briefly, and recent improvements in tube construction are described. These improvements contribute both to improved tube performance and to a simplification of fabrication and assembly operations. Specific constructional and processing advances are discussed."
"This paper describes a three-gun, tricolor picture tube of basically improved design. Its picture is presented on phosphors appplied directly to the curved internal face of the tube. With a curved screen, a curved mask which is self-supporting is used. The mask and the springs to hold it in place weigh only six ounces. This simple, light, yet rugged structure is mounted directly on the face plate. Three small \"VI\"-shaped surfaces on the mask rest on three hemispheres molded directly on the glass to locate the mask precisely. No adjustment is required at assembly. The phosphor dots are placed directly on the curved glass face plate by a photographic process, using the individual mask belonging to that tube as a negative. The screen will always exactly register with its mask because they are images of one another. The curved screen face plate serves also to close the envelope just as it does in the black-and-white tube. Advantages resulting from this design are discussed. The improvements in mechanical simplicity, ease of manufacture, size, weight, thermal-stability, electron optics, picture quality, and circuit stability are shown to stem from the use of a spherical mask and a spherical face plate. The performance of a developmental tube of this design is given. The practicability of alternate forms of this tube. including rectangular screen types in rectangular bulbs is examined. The possibility of using much of the conventional factory equipment for black-and-white picture tubes to make this new color tube is discussed."
"The paper describes in detail, with suitable block and circuit diagrams, the operation of a laboratory color television receiver fulfilling the present NTSC standards. The receiver consists of the video signal source and monochrome monitor, the color decoder system, the color synchronization system, local subcarrier oscillator, the horizontal and vertical deflection system, the high voltage (second anode and focus) and convergence system, and the tricolor tube's mount. Also, an additional color decoder is described which will permit the operation of color slave units in addition to the main color receiver."

"There may be many members of the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) and readers of its Proceedings who are not fully acquainted with the CCIR. Since therefore the VJIth Plenary Meeting of this body was recently held in London, it may perhaps be an appropriate subject for discussion here. The principal value of the C.C.I.R. is that it brings to a common international point the latest information on good practice for radio services. If full use is made of this information and operators all over the world design and work their equipment accordingly, the maximum use will be made of that great asset of mankind, valuable beyond price, the radio frequency spectrum."
"The fundamental principles of color-switching at the screen by retarding or accelerating fields with a single electron beam are described. A mathematical analysis is made showing the effects and importance of various voltage and geometric parameters. The focusing effects of the apertures and the uniform fields are fully investigated. A new method of aperture-mask-voltage modulation is given for the accelerating-field case. Single gun tubes using these beam-deflection principles have the advantages of automatic color registry, simple monochrome presentation, short physical length, low color-switching electrode capacitance, and equal numbers of each of the three-color elements. Tubes using the retarding field are advantageous for large size screens, but ones using the accelerating field make much more efficient use of the electron beam. A method of computing aperture positions to give uniform variation in spacings is described. Some of the techniques described in the construction of 16- and 24-inch reflection-type tubes include prevention of microphonics in the screen; printing methods that make webbing lines invisible; glass spacer blocks that withstand high voltage gradients; a method of etching slits in the screen at an angle to reduce beam-current interception; screen alloys that withstand high-power dissipation; and a high-current electron gun."
"A storage tube is described which maintains a bright visual display, using a charge pattern stored on an insulating layer to grid control the transmitted viewing beam. This insulating layer is a part of an image amplifier system, whose operation and characteristics are discussed. The factors affecting background uniformity and viewing duration have been investigated. Methods of extending the viewing duration by electrically compensating for ion landing have been developed. Erasure, which prepares the surface for the writing of new information, may either be over-all erasure of the entire picture, or selective erasure of only that area where new information is to be written. The present tubes will display a halftone picture of good quality for 30 seconds without compensation, and for over 3 minutes with compensation, after writing has stopped. The writing process can be accomplished in 1/30 second for a complete halftone picture. The resolution is over 500 lines on a 4-inch diameter screen, and there are at least 5 distnguishable halftone steps. As a radar indicator, this tube provides a flickerless display of the complete radar picture, which is bright enough for daylight viewing."
"A method is described for determining the circuit impedance of a slow-wave structure from experimental measurements of the perturbation in the resonant frequencies caused by passing small beads through the interaction region. From these measurements the gain parameter C of such a structure, when used as a traveling-wave tube, can be determined. The results agree with measured experimental gains as well as with theoretical calculations. The method is limited to periodic structures which can be short-circuited and hence made resonant. The principles involved are not new, but their adaptation to traveling-wave tubes is not generally known."
"A simple correlator employing the ring modulator circuit as a rapid-response multiplier has been developed which accepts signals on coaxial cables and which is usable over a wide range of microwave frequencies. The correlator output includes a bias term, but the value of this term can be predicted mathematically so that the correlator may be used for quantitative measurements."
"Errors which may occur in the calibration of peak or average reading amplitude modulation meters with a heterodyne signal are investigated in detail. Relations between the heterodyne-amplitude ratio M and the true modulation factor m of a sinusoidally modulated wave are derived. Using these results, heterodyne calibration of modulation analyzers to read m exactly can readily be carried out."
"A simple diagram consisting of two graduated straight lines and a point, completely represents a loss-free transducer. By a simple projective construction the input reactance corresponding to any terminating reactance may be quickly obtained, and, by an extension of the construction, complex impedances may also be transformed. The method allows a visual as well as numerical grasp to be obtained of the transforming action of the transducer. The construction depends on the principle that in any bilinear transformation of a function of a complex variable there are straight lines which transform into straight lines, and that the relation between corresponding points on these straight lines is projective."
"A method of making a radar system self-calibrating has been developed to obtain the ratio of power received to power transmitted with minimum effort. A portion of the transmitter pulse is made to bounce back and forth in a long, short-circuited, microwave-transmission line where it is delayed and attenuated. A portion of the power in the pulse is fed into the receiver at regular intervals to calibrate its output in terms of the transmitter power. Analytical expressions required for an understanding of the system have been developed. Several practical microwave-transmission lines have been studied. A self-calibrating system has been constructed, and the experimental results agree with theory."
"To reduce the effective resistance due to skin effect in the conductor carrying the high frequency current, it is proposed that the conductor may be laminated and insulated at right angles to flow of the current, and it is called a series laminated conductor. In the series laminated conductor, it is shown that the distribution of the current becomes skin effect in pieces of the conductor, while bone effect in layers of the dielectric, and it is concluded that its effective resistance will become smaller than that of the solid conductor."
"Five different types of transmission line systems are analyzed and are shown to possess directional properties at the lower radio frequencies. The conditions of mismatch on either transmission line or on both transmission lines have been taken into account, as well as lengths of coupling greater than a fractional wavelength. A new and more general scatter matrix for directional couplers which includes the condition of mismatch is developed. In addition, lumped circuit directional couplers have been developed as a consequence of the general transmission line theory."
"General expressions for the power spectra of carriers frequency and phase modulated by Gaussian noise are given as functions of the shapes of the power spectra of the modulating voltages. Specific asymptotic (closed-form) expressions are obtained for the special case when the modulating voltage has a rectangular low-pass power spectrum. This particular case corresponds to the use of maximally flat and similar video amplifier tuning schemes. The half-power bandwidths of the power spectra of the modulated carriers are obtained from these asymptotic expressions and are plotted as functions of the root-mean-square frequency and phase deviations. The delta function at the carrier frequency (representing power remaining in the carrier) is evaluated for phase and frequency modulation where, in the latter case, the delta function exists only if the power spectrum of the modulating voltage does not extend to zero frequency."
"Step discontinuities in disk transmission lines may be approximately allowed for using the known results for steps in parallel plane transmission lines. A correction factor is calculated for the case of a disk line and shown to depend on whether the step up is away from or towards the center. The factor is given by Lo Kl(n7r3) sin2 n7ra 1 Ko(nir#) a2n3 x0 sin2 nira 1 a2n3 for an outward step up, where K0 and K1 are modified Bessel functions of the second kind. For an inward step up, K0and K1 are replaced by I) and 11, the modified Bessel functions of the first kind. Graphical charts are given which allow the factors to be directly determined from the shape parameters α and β."
"Residual gas within the envelope of an electron tube forms positive ions by electron collision. Ordinarily these ions are quickly lost to the cathode; however, if they can be held within the beam space, the spreading due to the space charge of the beam might be considerably reduced. A \"trapping\" electrode, with an appropriate positive potential, placed at the cathode end of the drift tube was believed sufficient to affect trapping. Since this simple method was first proposed, attempts to make the scheme work yielded inexplicable results. A detailed study of the phenomenon reveals that the trapping process is more complex than was originally believed. A qualitative theory is advanced which is consistent with experiment and leads to suggestions for an improved performance. By a proper design of the trapping electrode, transmission through a drift space was improved from twelve per cent to eighty per cent."
"This paper describes a waveguide component particularly useful as a broadband impedance-measurement instrument. The component consists of a length of circular waveguide at right angles to the broad wall of a rectangular waveguide, and coupled to it by three apertures. A probe rotated one turn in the circular waveguide will sample a field variation exactly equivalent to that in one guide wavelength of the rectangular waveguide. This condition may be maintained with high accuracy over approximately a 20-per cent bandwidth. The principle of operation of the device is discussed in the paper and design equations given. Several possible applications are described."
"The weighting functions for a linear time-varying system provide a means for determining system response to an arbitrary input, and also the mean square output with white noise input. The weighting functions as obtained by direct simulation are not in convenient form for such computation, but can be obtained in such form by use of the adjoint of the original system. A method is presented for the synthesis of the adjoint system for a given linear time-varying feedback system. The method is based on a physical argument in which outputs due to two inputs which place identical initial conditions in the system are equated."
"A procedure is described for calculating the characteristics of propagating modes in dielectric sheets. Specifically, if a required wavelength of the guided wave is given, the appropriate free space wavelength and thickness of the dielectric sheet can be readily obtained, and these variables are related through a single parameter. The methods used are those of geometric optics and transmission line analogies."

"Ferroelectric materials are the dielectric analog of ferromagnetic materials. Their uses parallel those of ferromagnetic materials in such applications as high permeability materials, magnetostrictive transducers, magnetic amplifiers, and magnetic information storage devices. A review is given of the measured properties of single crystals to provide a background for the application of ceramics in capacitors and transducers, and their application in dielectric amplifiers. It is shown that the properties of ceramics can be stabilized by introducing amounts of lead and calcium titanate. A long-time aging effect can be reduced by a proper heat treatment. With these stabilized ceramics, applications such as electromechanical filters and delay lines can be satisfied. The theory of the dielectric amplifier is discussed and it is shown that stable amplifiers can be obtained by using the properties of single crystals. Amplifiers having carrier frequencies of 200 kc, signal frequencies of 0 to 7,000 cycles, and gains of 12 db, have been realized. These operate with single crystals below the Curie temperature and are stable over a wide temperatue range."
"The analytical solution of the diffusion equation has been used to construct an accurate equivalent circuit of the junction transistor. All network components are expressed in terms of the physical parameters of the transistor. This network has been used to calculate Mason's U-function, which in turn gives the highest frequency at which a transistor can give a power gain. From the derived formula, it is possible to see how the physical parameters interact to limit the frequency response. The design requirements for a given maximum frequency can be obtained from the formulas; a few examples are discussed. The accurate equivalent circuit will be helpful in designing transistors for more specialized applications."
"Two new single-velocity electron stream amplifiers, which use neither slow-wave guiding nor resonant circuitry, are described. The major part of the amplification is obtained in a drifttube region where either the tube diameter or the stream diameter varies periodically. The period length is a quarter-plasma waveength; the gain mechanism is one of reinforcing the simple harmonic motion of the electrons in the stream. A general theory is presented from which a gain formula is obtained for rippled wall, rippled stream, and velocity jump amplification. Design curves are shown. An experimental rippled wall amplifier operating in the range 1 to 4 kmc is discussed."
"This paper considers stability problems encountered in measuring parameters of vhf point contact transistors. It develops the high frequency modification of the low frequency requirement for stability. It then considers instability which may be caused by negative resistance collector regions. This type of instability is responsible for breaks or discontinuities which have been observed in the static characteristics of some point contact transistors. Simple stabilized circuits for static characteristic curve tracers, using either oscilloscopic or X-Y recorder presentation, are given."
"The design of a linear system often takes the form of its response in the time domain to a test function. Computation of such response, particularly in the case of feedback systems, is usually complex and time consuming. Numerical methods have been applied successfully but to date, generally, they have not been related closely to the physical system being analyzed. It is shown in this paper that the z-transformation developed originally for the analysis and synthesis of sampled-data systems is applicable to numerical solutions of continuous linear systems. A model of the continuous linear system is devised in which sampling is introduced at some convenient point. The sampled time function is then reconstructed into a polygonal approximation by means of a holding operator and the output of the system is readily computed as a train of pulses giving the values of the output at sampling instants. Both analytic and arbitrary inputs can be handled by this model. The errors in the output which result by making computations on the sampled model rather than the actual system are obtainable by the application of a procedure quite similar to that of the main computation. An illustrative example using feedback is given where it is shown that the theoretical predictions concerning error produced by the model are within very close tolerances to the actual error."
"This paper presents the theory of the traveling-wave tube (TWT) and magnetron amplifier, and of the corresponding backward-wave oscillators, in a uinified form. Expressions are derived for amplifier gain, and oscillator starting current and tuning properties."
"A backward-wave oscillator which is electronically tuned over a five to one frequency range is described. Oscillations were observed from 2,600 to 13,300 megacycles with power output up to 50 mw. Equations for starting current and efficiency are derived and compared to experimental results. Other aspects of backward-wave oscillators are also discussed."
"A realizable, low-pass, minimum-phase transfer function is constructed which produces \"maximally flat\" time delay as a function of frequency, and which is associated with an impulse response that resembles closely a Gaussian curve properly delayed with respect to t= 0. The delay and loss characteristics are particularly easy to evaluate, since this transfer function can be expressed in terms of conveniently tabulated functions. It is shown how to realize this transfer function as the transfer impedance of a ladder network containing only low-Q elements, and the response of this network is put into perspective to those of conventionally designed delay networks. Also, a class of nonminimum-phase transfer functions is generated from the above transfer functions in order to offer added flexibility. The delay and loss characteristics of the nonminimum-phase transfer functions are described, but their network realization is not considered in this paper."
"If an equalizer amplitude-response curve is specified, it will be shown that the minimum flat loss obtainable with physical networks is determined. This flat loss, or scale factor on the response curve, is a function of the equalizer output-terminating impedance, which is arbitrary but prescribed, and the specified tolerance on input mismatch. If the output impedance is purely reactive, the limitations on maximum voltage transfer are obtained from a consideration of the open circuit impedance parameters of the system. If power or voltage transfer to a load with finite real part is to be optimized, the scattering parameters of the system are used to determine the limits of performance. Examples will be given comparing the performance of matched and lossless equalizers. In many practical cases the latter do not have substantially higher gain than the matched equalizer."
"The natural coupling between parallel transmission lines is inherently directional. Very simple and cheap directional couplers can be made which utilize this effect. By introducing appropriate variation of coupling with distance a wide variety of transmission characteristics may be realized, including high-pass (ideally, infinite bandwidth) characteristics. The coupled lines may be of equal or different impedance. Thus, a simple configuration of four wires (or two wires and ground) can serve simultaneously as a directional coupler, filter, and transformer."
"In this paper a method for calibrating loop antennas in a shielded enclosure is analyzed. The scheme considered involves the generation of a known field in the vicinity of the loop by an energized wire mounted near the ceiling of the enclosure. The published formulas for computing the field are based upon simplifying approximations which result in large inaccuracies in many cases. To extend the usefulness of the method new formulas are developed with which the field can be predicted with better than 1 per cent accuracy in the low and medium frequency ranges for most installations. The results can be applied over most of the high frequency region with a possible reduction of accuracy. A method is presented for estimating the error in this region. Finally, the passible limitation of the method at very low frequencies is discussed."

"This is a review paper which discusses in simple terms high-power klystrons, double-tuned circuits for reflex klystrons, noise in traveling-wave tubes and its reduction by velocity-jump or space-charge-wave deamplification, periodic magnetic focusing of electron beams, and the backward-wave oscillator."
"Empirical evidence suggests that, at least for short periods of activity, the simpler the tasks imposed upon the human operator of a control system, the more precise and less variable become his responses. This leads to the view that optimal man-machine control system performance can be obtained only when the mechanical components of the system are designed so that the human need act only as a simple amplifier. Ways and means are described for achieving such design through \"unburdening\" (relieving the operator of the task of acting as an integrator) and \"quickening\" (providing the operator with immediate knowledge of the effects of his own responses). Aided tracking is discussed in light of these two concepts and is related to various efforts to improve the stability of man-machine systems through the use of special equalization networks."
"The term \"dielectric potentiometer\" is used to designate a new type of controllable voltage divider employing a lossy liquid dielectric as the impedance medium. With proper design, the dielectric potentiometer may be operated over an extremely wide frequency range with a flat amplitude response and zero phase shift. Unlike conventional wire-wound and film type controls, the new device is readily capable of being perfectly compensated for broadband operation when operated into either resistive or capacitive loading, or a parallel combination of both. Other advantages include infinite resolution, long life, and adaptability to specific nonlinear requirements. Probable advantages such as a low noise figure and the capability of operation at high rotational speeds have yet to be experimentally investigated. Examples of designs for particular applications are given."
"In the consideration of the junction transistor as a switch there are three characteristics of primary interest, the open impedance, the closed impedance, and the switching-time. A generalized two-terminal-pair theory of junction transistors is presented which is applicable, on a dc basis, in all regions of operation. Using this theory, the open and closed impedances of the transistor switch are expressible in terms of easily measurable transistor parameters. For the ideal transistor these parameters are the saturation currents of the emitter and collector junctions and the normal and inverted alphas. The transition of the transistor switch from open to closed, or vice versa, is discussed, including the effects of minority carrier storage. This transition can be expressed in analytic form in terms of the alphas and the normal and inverted alpha cut-off frequencies."
"Transient response in the active region for junction transistors can be calculated from the conventional small-signal equivalent circuit. This small-signal characterization is adequate to calculate turn-on time and decay time. Carrier storage time, or time for the transistor operating point to move from the current saturation region to the active region, is calculated from a small-signal characterization of the transistor in the current saturation region. Frequency cutoff of alpha, ωN (radians/second) is the most important single transistor parameter affecting switching speed. It is possible with moderate driving current to switch the operating point from collector current cutoff to collector current saturation in times of the order of 3/ωN. To switch from collector current saturation to collector current cutoff, in times of the order of 3/ωN, carrier storage effects must be avoided."
"Criteria for the amplitude stability of a power oscillator are derived in the form of two inequalities. These inequalities involve derivatives which are computed graphically from the constant current design diagram that is customarily used for power oscillators. In the final form of the inequalities, the derivatives used are of the double logarithmic type: that is the fractional increment of one variable divided by the fractional increment of the other. In addition, the criteria involve the ratio of fed-back power to plate power and the ratio of the time constant of the grid leak and condenser combination to the time constant of the tank circuit. There are also involved certain trigonometric functions of the grid current and plate current angles of flow."
"When a radar is subjected to an extemal noise generator there is a reduction of range which may be calculated by an easy analytical method if some simplifying hypotheses are adopted. This paper describes such a method for two typical cases: (a) the noise generator (n.g.) is carried by the target, (b) the n.g. is in a different fixed place. The discussion is developed first in relation to a freespace condition, leading to a determination of the \"reduced range index.\" It is then extended to a condition in which the reflection from ground must be taken into account, the ground being sea water. Finally, the visibility factor in a radar influenced by an external noise generator is briefly considered."
"Miniaturization of capacitors for low voltage applications has been restricted by lack of availability of thin dielectric films which can be handled mechanically. This restriction is not relieved by ceramics with dielectric constants of one or two thousand, because of the relatively thick films which must be used, because of the poor performance of such ceramics at elevated temperature, and because ceramics do not lend themselves to construction of wound capacitors to provide high capacitance values. Lacquer film capacitors represent an attempt to overcome the restriction on dielectric thickness. Although these capacitors are still in the development stage they show considerable promise for use in transistor circuits. One type of lacquer film capacitor is made by casting a thin dielectric film on a supporting base and carrying it through the process of metallizing and slitting while supported. After stripping the film, the only mechanical process which it has to endure as a self-supporting sheet is that of being wound into capacitor units. Metallized films 0.1 mil thick have been made in appreciable quantity, and resulting capacitors are about one-seventh the size of the smallest metallized paper capacitors. For fragile dielectrics, the supporting film may be wound into the capacitor unit. This type suffers in compactness when compared with the stripped lacquer film type, but its use may be justified when it is desired to use fragile dielectrics of exceptional electrical properties."

"The performance of alloy-junction transistors falls off as the frequency increases. Heretofore, the chief cause of this has been the resistance-capacitance low-pass filter effect in the base-emitter input. The effect is produced by the germanium resistance (between the external base connection and the active junction region) and the emitter-to-base diffusion capacitance. The latter may be extraordinarily high because of the relatively slow diffusion of charge carriers into the base region which must be charged up and discharged with minority carriers. In the new transistor design of the present paper, resistance and capacitance have been reduced by using a thick wafer of low-resistance germanium and placing the active junctions on a very thin section produced by drilling a well into the wafer. The junctions are about 0.0005 inch apart. Other capacitances are reduced by using small diameter junctions. To prevent limitation due to transit-time dispersion, nearly planar junctions are obtained by using germanm-indium alloy discs from which the junctions are formed. The new unit will give 39-db gain (neutralized) at 455 kc, 12 db (unneutralized) at 10 mc and has an oscillation limit of 75 mc. A noise factor at 1 mc as low as 4 db is achieved."
"This paper describes an audio-frequency oscillator using two junction transistors in push-pull Class C operation. The circuit features an over-all efficiency as high as 75 per cent, low distortion, signal-to-noise ratio better than 100 db, and a high degree of amplitude stability. The amplitude can be held to the order of one per cent over wide ranges of supply voltage, output loading, and temperature. The stabilization is achieved by comparing the output amplitude with a reference voltage, which is obtained by means of the so-called break-up effect in semiconductor p-n junctions. An analysis of the circuit is appended."
"This paper deals with the application of the principles presently employed in the design of directional antennas for the Standard Broadcast band to the control of radiation from TV transmitting antennas in order that optimum use is made of the energy radiated from such antennas. Until very recently TV antennas were designed primarily to concentrate the radiated energy in the direction of the horizontal plane and the greater this concentration the more desirable the antenna. During the past year the engineering profession has realized the importance of determining the nature of the area to be served by a given antenna system and then designing the antenna to cover this area most effectively with the power available. The need for such design is shown by several examples of problems already solved by this method and the general method of attack on the problem is developed in some detail."
"Considering potential practical applications of low-temperature phenomena, a general survey is made of the temperature dependence of noise and electrical resistance down to the region of Absolute Zero. It is shown that the signal-to-noise ratio in a metallic resistor can be increased by lowering its temperature, while cooling has little effect on carbon resistors. The theory of electrical conductance in metals is reviewed, and it is determined that whenever ohmic losses are important as in an inductance, decreasing the temperature can be a help. The phenomenon of superconductivity is treated, including use of the superconducting properties of certain metals in the construction of a very sensitive bolometer and in the frictionless suspension of a lead sphere."
"Factors affecting the useful life of transistors are discussed. From consideration of their structure, long life might well be expected, and has been shown to occur for usual laboratory conditions. However, under high humidity or high temperature, life is sometimes greatly shortened. Mechanisms of the effects are described. Corrective measures are under way."
"This paper discusses a laboratory method which has been found very useful for measuring the resistivity of the semiconductor germanium. The method consists of placing four probes that make contact along a line on the surface of the material. Current is passed through the outer pair of probes and the floating potential is measured across the inner pair. There are seven cases considered, the probes on a semi-infinite volume of semiconductor material and the probes near six different types of boundaries. Formulas and curves needed to compute resistivity are given for each case."
"Any physically realizable RLC transfer function-impedance, admittance, or dimensionless ratio-can be realized within a multiplicative constant by the synthesis procedures presented in this paper. The form of network achieved is a lattice with these significant features: (a) it may have any desirable termination; (b) it contains no mutual inductance; (c) every inductance in the network appears with an associated series resistance so that, in building the network, low-Q coils may be used. In addition, the lattice arms are of so simple a form relative to each other that many of the achieved lattices are amenable to reduction to unbalanced networks. Further, in case of a transfer admittance, reduction can be achieved with the use at most of real transformers i.e., transformers with winding resistance, finite magnetizing inductance, and a coupling coefficient smaller than one."
"Second and third order harmonic distortions are evaluated which are generated in a network of known transfer functions when subjected to an undistorted FM input signal. From the general Carson and Fry formula for the response of the network, both quasi-stationary and nonquasi-stationary terms can be evaluated with the aid of normalized derivatives of the gain and phase function of the network. These normalized functions can be calculated by adding contributions of every significant pole and zero of the transfer function. The distortions are evaluated in discrete terms and presented in a form which lends itself well to quantitative discussion. One numerical example is included."
"Frequency-shift, phase-shift, and on-off amplitude modulation are examined as mechanisms. Curves of fractional error as a function of average carrier-to-noise ratio are derived for fading and non-fading carriers. The results are applicable to telegraph, teletype, and other binary-coded signals."
"The principal result of this paper is the derivation of a general rational function having arbitrary poles which approximates zero with a Tchebycheff characteristic. It is shown how this function can be used to obtain transfer functions which possess a Tchebycheff, low-pass filter characteristic and for which either the poles or zeros are arbitrary. Two applications for this function are given: (1) low-pass RC filters having a specified ripple in the pass band, and (2) low-pass filters having a specified ripple in the pass band and points of infinite attenuation at arbitrary frequencies outside the pass band."
"When used in a control system, the digital computer operates in real time and interacts dynamically with other parts of the system. It is desirable to examine its effect by the use of conventional techniques of servo-mechanism design, namely, frequency analysis. An important feature of most digital computers is that the data passing through them are in sampled form. Frequency analysis has already been applied to the process of sampling and sampled-data systems. The present paper extends this approach to operations performed on the data in sampled form, such as by a digital computer. A real-time linear digital-computer program can be represented by a transfer function. Thus, the computer with its program is a filter whose analysis and design can proceed along lines familiar in network theory and servo design. The error analysis of familiar numerical formulas is illustrated. Various properties of programs are studied in both the s-domain (complex frequency) and the z-domain (complex delay). Tests for stability (or convergence) are described and illustrated. Programming is discussed from a new point of view, and a new programming method is developed. It is indicated how such studies could conceivably affect the logical design or instruction code of a computer."
"Any transfer function, in order to be physically realizable as a lossless coupling network terminated in a single resistance, must have an even or odd polynomial as its numerator. Such a function, representing a transfer admittance, a transfer voltage ratio, or a transfer impedance, can be realized by the method of this paper as a lossless lattice network terminated in resistance and possessing no mutual inductance. If the numerator of the transfer admittance or voltage ratio is even and the numerator of the transfer impedance is odd, these lattices can always be reduced to unbalanced networks. No ideal transformers are needed in the final network; only one real transformer is required, where a real transformer is defined as one that has a coupling coefficient smaller than one and finite magnetizing inductance."
"Measurement procedures based upon Weissfloch's separation of a dissipative network into lossy and lossless portions are presented for the determination of the equivalent circuit parameters of dissipative four-terminal structures. The methods are developed around \"distance invariant\" equivalent networks which possess a number of desirable features in addition to permitting a simplification in the necessary calculations. They are particularly suited to such applications as the junction between surface wave or microstrip lines and their respective feed lines. Rapid and convenient semi-precision procedures are treated in some detail and sample calculations are presented."

"The fundamentals of ferromagnetism are recalled before discussing the principles which guided the development of modern, nonmetallic, magnetic materials. Basic reasons for the properties of \"Ferrox-cube\" and \"Magnadur\" are explained in detail."
"This paper discusses the limitations of germanium-junction transistors at elevated operating temperatures. The limiting factors are a consequence of increased thermal hole-electron pair generation at higher temperatures. This causes an increase in collector \"leakage\" current, which affects the base current. Thus, due to the base-lead resistance, the emitter to base-bias conditions are changed. The problems associated with power transistors are discussed, including cooling of the unit, current and voltage limitations, and reduction in base-lead resistance. It is pointed out that, in addition to bias changes, base lead resistance also causes a power loss which becomes important at the high currents used in power units. Examples of liquid convection cooled and metallic conduction cooled n-p-n and p-n-p power transistors are described. Satisfactory \"alpha\" values are maintained to collector currents of over one hundred milliamperes. In class A operation power gains exceeding 30 db and efficiencies close to the theoretical limit of 50 per cent are obtained at 1 watt dissipation levels."
"By a consideration of the amplitude and duration of echoes forward-scattered from individual meteor ionization trails, and of the probability of detecting randomly oriented trails over an oblique radio propagation path, an estimate of the contribution of meteoric ionization to extended range hf and vhf radio transmission has been obtained. It has been concluded that meteoric ionization alone would give a virtually continuous signal for a transmission path of about 1,000 km at frequencies near 15 mc. For the very high frequencies, scattering from meteor trails has been found to be at least an important contributing factor to the propagation of a signal over an oblique path. A precise evaluation of the role of this process must await a better determination of the number of trails as a function of their ionization density."
"This work contains analyses of both point-contact and junction transistors as mixers. Experimental results for signals up to 400 megacycles are presented. The conversion ability of transistor mixers is dependent on the IF and signal frequencies. The IF frequency is limited to the region of amplification of the transistor. The signal frequency range is ultimately limited by the capacitance which shunts the emitter when it is biased in the reverse direction. The analysis is simplified by dividing the signal frequency spectrum into three regions as follows: in the low-frequency range conversion is strongly dependent on alpha; in the medium-frequency range conversion depends primarily on base resistance; in the highfrequency range conversion is mainly dependent on emitter reverse shunting capacitance. The conversion gain influences the noise factor. At low frequencies, a junction transistor mixer equals the performance of a crystal diode mixer followed by a junction transistor amplifier. At vhf frequencies conversion gain may still be obtained if point-contact transistors are used; however, at present, their noise factor is higher than that which can be obtained by the combination of the diode and the transistor amplifier."
"Transmission of uniform plane waves at normal incidence through a multilayer transparent coated glass structure, with thin conductive layers, is investigated. Dependence of the degree of shielding obtainable on the type of construction, thickness and dielectric constant of the glass layers, and on the surface resistivity of the coating is studied from the standpoint of both analysis and design, and correlated with the resulting transparency. Dependence on frequency and, to some extent, reflection from the structure, are also investigated. Theoretical results are correlated with experimental data to show the applicability of this analysis to practical cases of more complex fields."
"Inductorless filters are attractive for numerous practical reasons. Passive RC filters, however, suffer from the defects of high in-band loss and poor economy of elements. These defects are overcome in active RC filters in which amplifying elements supply power to the filter in addition to that applied by the signal. A class of active filters is described in which one active component, a transistor negative-impedance converter, is employed. Simple unbalanced network configurations are obtained in which the number of capacitors in the RC circuits is equal to the total number of reactive elements in the corresponding LC filter. The ultimate limit in performance in this class of active filters is the drift in the converter. The drift in input impedance in converters employing Darlington's compound transistors is only a few tenths of a per cent of the load impedance for a wide range of loads. Such stability is more than adequate for many practical filter applications. The theory of this type of active RC filters is discussed and experimental tests are reported on low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters."
"The causes of valve noise are analyzed and the distinction is made between rattle noise and that produced by resonances. The contribution of various electodes to the total noise produced is discussed, and it is shown that the resonant frequencies of these electrodes may be calculated. Data are given proving the validity of these empirical equations. Methods of measuring noise are outlined. Finally, the implications of the findings are applied to valve-design improvements."
"While in a steady state the output frequency of an amplifier must be the same as its input frequency, transient differences occur whenever the input frequency changes. A general formula has been derived for the output voltage resulting from an abrupt frequency shift; and by manipulating the terms of this formula, the instantaneous frequency deviation has been determined. Detailed computations have been made for large frequency shifts in a single tuned circuit, and for small frequency shifts in amplifiers having various numbers of tuned circuits. For large steps of frequency deviation, the shape of the output deviation depends on the magnitude of the step, the initial frequency (before the step), and whether the step is toward or away from the midband frequency. For small steps near midband, the transient response of a given band-pass filter is the same for frequency modulation as for amplitude modulation, and can be described as the response to a voltage step in an equivalent video circuit. Stagger tuning causes overshoot in the transient response, but such overshoot will be small if the stagger is no more than enough to provide maximally-flat amplitude response in the steady state."
"It is shown that the resonant properties of axially symmetric cavities can be calculated using data obtained on an analogous static system in an electrolytic tank. The electrodes simulating the cavity are split into segments to allow a measurement of the current distribution along the electrodes. This current distribution is then used to obtain an approximation to the distribution of dynamic charge density over the walls of the cavity, and so yields the current distribution in the cavity. Calculations of the cavity parameters from the estimated current distribution yield results within a few per cent of the values measured on an actual cavity."
"An introductory comparison is made between the classical or indirect method of designing nondissipative filter networks, and the direct method of designing recurrent filters or delay lines with arbitrarily assigned frequency phase relationships within the passbands. A few examples are given of the application of the latter method to the design of ideal structures."
"It is shown that phase-difference networks operating at radio rather than at audio frequency may be used to obtain selectivity by polyphase methods. Design and practical realization of such networks are considered. A polyphase selective system suitable for single-sideband transmission or reception is described, in which the selective action takes place directly at radio frequency so that a number of individual systems may be cascaded in situations where a very high degree of over-all selectivity must be obtained."
"A simple frequency meter is described which, if properly coupled to the signal source, can produce a direct reading of frequency to the nearest kilocycle in the range of 3 to 30 megacycles. Present techniques could be used to extend the range above or below the one presently used by some modification of the system described."

"The operation of a dc transistor amplifier is greatly affected by drift of the output current. This drift is caused primarily by changes of temperature of transistors since some of the parameters of transistors, like the collector current for zero emitter current, Ico, are very sensitive to temperature. In this paper the problem of the drift in dc transistor amplifiers, caused by changes of temperature, is analyzed and different methods for the solution of this problem are recommended. One of these methods, which provides an effective means for compensation, is based on the use of temperature-sensitive resistors as a compensating element. The second part of this paper contains operating characteristics of such an experimental dc amplifier, employing this method of temperature compensation."
"This paper presents a design procedure for the practical design of RC wide-band 90-degree phase-difference networks. The important part of the paper is the design procedure given in \"cookbook\" fashion with a numerical example to clarify it. This procedure consists of many steps, each step being a relatively simple one. This should make it a useful design tool for people without much background in network theory. A brief theoretical introduction is presented but this is far too sketchy to be of much use in understanding just what is behind the design procedure. Some practical hints on construction and alignment are given."
"This paper describes the design of a three-phase oscillator covering the range from 0.01 to 1,000 cycles per second. The problems peculiar to this frequency range, and their solutions, are discussed. Certain advantages inherent in three-phase operation are explained."
"Physical systems with a very large number of variables (say with tens of thousands) may be solved with available digital computers by tearing the system apart into a large number of small subdivisions. After solving each subdivision separately, the partial solutions are interconnected by a set of transformations so as to obtain the exact solution of the original system. Among the many advantages of the tearing method is the reduction of the amount of original calculations to a small fraction of about 2/n2, where n is the number of subdivisions. Another advantage is the reduction of the number of nonzero elements in inverse matrices to a fraction smaller than 1/√n. The same labor saving appears also in smaller systems using slide-rule calculations. This paper illustrates the solution of Maxwell two-dimensional field-equations by tearing their electriccircuit models apart into a convenient number of subdivisions."
"In a previous paper homogeneous ring quasi-arrays of tangential or radial dipoles were introduced, i.e. systems of dipoles arranged equidistantly along a circle, the dipoles being oriented in tangential or radial directions and carrying currents with the same amplitude, but with a phase that increases uniformly along the circle. Such quasi-arrays are azimuthally omnidirectional, and the radiated field will be mainly horizontally polarized and concentrated around the plane of the circle. In this paper expressions are obtained for the radiation resistance and the gain of homogeneous ring quasi-arrays of an infinite number of tangential or radial dipoles, and from the results arrived at conclusions are drawn as to the applicability of such antenna systems."
"A voltage-controlled logarithmic attenuator is presented that may be stabilized by the use of dc degeneration and a suitable increase in loop gain. The stabilized attenuator may be designed as either a high- or low-impedance device. A design procedure is outlined for each case. A discussion of experimental results concludes the paper."
"An understanding of the operation of a least squares smoother is enhanced by establishing an m-dimensional space in which inputs and outputs are vectors and the smoother is a transformation. The concept of transmission and rejection manifold as established by Zadeh is introduced and the manner in which signal and noise are separated is illustrated geometrically. An explicit pictorial representation of the process is given for the three dimensional case."

"A Theoretical solution for the frequency variation of the four small-signal parameters of a junction transistor has been obtained by extending Shockley's analysis and by taking account of space-charge-layer widening as suggested by J. M. Early. From the results of this solution, it has been possible to explain the experimentally observed frequency variation of open-circuit collector-base admittance of fused-junction p-n-p junction transistors that was reported earlier and is described here in more detail. The theoretical frequency variation of the current-amplification factor and of the other two small-signal parameters (open-circuit voltage-feedback factor h12 and short-circuit input impedance h11, for the grounded-base connection) also is discussed in some detail. Numerical results are included for each of the four parameters in the form of curves of normalized parameters versus relative frequency. Derivation of the voltage-current relations for the theoretical model is given separately in section II. The effect of base-spreading resistance is taken into account in the usual manner by addition of a lumped resistance to the base contact of the theoretical model."
"This paper presents experimental and theoretical results on focusing a long electron beam with a permanent magnet structure which produces a periodic magnetic field along the axis of the electron beam. In principle, the periodic permanent magnet made up of N cells will be reduced in weight by a factor of N2 over a permanent magnet producing a uniform field over the same length. The periodic focusing results are comparable to results obtainable with a uniform field. In addition the periodic fields for certain combinations of beam voltage and magnetic field exhibit regions of \"stop bands\" wherein the beam becomes unstable and no current reaches the collector."
"Utilizing the most intense of the several hundred celestial sources of radio frequency energy, and known data about the effective diameter of the sun at various ranges of radio frequencies, a technique for plotting the directional characteristics of large antennas is outlined. Over-all system sensitivities (receiver, antenna, and transmission line) are checked by using values already obtained for sky temperatures. The general receiver characteristics necessary for such measurements are outlined. Patterns of antennas are illustrated and their analysis evaluated."
"A noise source of the gas-discharge type for use at eight rillimeters wavelength is described. Noise temperatures of 19,300 degrees K (18.2 db above room temperature) using neon, and 11,500 degrees K (15.9 db) using argon, have been measured by means of a microwave radiometer. These figures agree well with values calculated from gas-discharge theory."
"The FM response to the unit impulse and the unit step function is calculated for a network whose transfer function is known. A meaning is assigned to the associated Fourier integral, which diverge in the Riemann sense. The method is generalized to any input function which vanishes for negative t. As an illustration of the method the impulse and the step FM responses of a single tuned circuit are calculated."
"The equipment practice described and illustrated in this paper and referred to as Unit Construction Practice is based on the conception that the number of different circuit functions used in line-transmission technique is small and that these circuit functions can be performed by relatively few standardized components. Once these facts are recognized it is an obvious step to adopt an equipment practice in which a series of self-contained units, each comprising an assembly of standardized components and designed to perform a distinct circuit function, become the \"bricks\" which can be used in different combinations to build different types of systems. It is claimed that the new practice results in equipment which offers a degree of standardization combined with flexibility and a ready adoption to civil or military purposes not possible using earlier practices. Considerable space-saving is also effected."
"The time in which a junction diode may be switched from forward to reverse conduction is of great importance in computing networks. By considering the behavior of the minority carriers in a diode In a representative switching circuit an approximate solution for the switching transient may be derived. The transient is separated into two phases: first, one of constant current, where the flow is limited by the external resistance, and second, a \"collection\" phase, where the current decays at a rate determined by the minority carrier lifetime and the dimensions of the diode. A critical parameter in the solution is the ratio of the short-circuit reverse current to the forward current before switching. The mathematical treatment is a boundary value solution of the minority carrier diffusion equations which is accomplished by the use of Laplace transformations. The duration of the two phases of current flow is determined for a planar junction, a hemispherical junction, and for a planar junction with junction-to-contact distance small compared to a diffusion length. The last treatment is extended to the junction transistor and the behavior of the collector current is calculated. The general results indicate that for a given nority carrier lifetime the last two of the three diode structures will give the smallest switching times. In addition it is found generally that the time is minimized by decreasing lifetime and increasing the ratio of reverse to forward current."
"The transient response of fixed, lumped, linear, and stable networks is investigated and many bounds are shown to exist on the.impulse and step responses of various classes of system functions. Conversely, if the impulse response is restricted in certain ways, bounds must then exist on the frequency response. These bounds, which are obtained by manipulating the Fourier transforms, have many practical implications. For instance, the response due to a unit impulse of current on a passive driving point impedance which has a shunting capacity, C, across its input terminals is bounded by ±(1/C) and the rise time for a low pass system of this form must be greater than rC where r equals the value of the impedance under dc conditions. Similar statements may be made for transfer functions satisfying certain mathematical restrictions. As other examples, more severe lower bounds have been found on the settling time for such systems. Also the overshoot or undershoot of the response to a step input of current for an RC driving point impedance cannot be greater than one hundred per cent."
"A multi-terminal transducer (m.t.t.) is a network with a set of n input terminals and a set of n output terminals. The properties of m.t.t.'s and their representation by matrices are a generalization of four-pole theory. The m.t.t. is represented by its impedance, admittance or transfer matrices. The special properties of m.t.t.'s that exhibit symmetry, reciprocity or both properties are discussed. The representation is definite or indefinite according to whether the voltage reference terminals are specified or not. Methods are derived to write down the transfer matrices of given m.t.t.'s. Some simple networks may be analyzed by inspection; more complicated networks may be treated as a cascade of simpler ones"
"During the first year of continuous operation of the Cheyenne Mountain propagation program, recordings of 1,046-mc fields at receiving locations within the radio horizon have exhibited \"fadeouts\" or prolonged periods of attenuation often in excess of 20 db below the monthly median level and lasting from a minute up to several hours. The occurrence of these fadeouts has been found to coincide with widespread super-refraction as evidenced by enhanced signals beyond the radio horizon and ground modification of the refractive index profile."
"An indoor method for measuring the radar cross section of objects by modulating the position of the object is described. The use of synchronous detection and employment of a substitution technique wherein the scattering from an object under test and a known object are measured and compared simultaneously reduce measurement error to ±2 per cent. The characteristics of the system are discussed, and its advantages and limitations are compared with other systems. Measured curves for the back-scattering cross-section of dipoles for lengths from 0.4λ to 1.6λ show good agreement with other published theoretical and experimental curves. Methods for measuring back-scattering and off-angle scattering from irregular objects by extension of this technique are indicated."

"Study by Aeronautical Radio, Inc., of electron tubes removed from military equipments, discloses four principal contributors to tube failure or removal: Maintenance and operating conditions, environment, application, and basic tube weaknesses. Examples of trouble caused by misapplication and environment are presented. Over-all returns from various military bases show that one tube in every three removed is not defective and should not have been removed. Taking into account the \"no-defect\" removals and gradual deterioration failures which could have been detected by good maintenance procedures before they caused equipment failure, only one tube in six removed is of a type liable to produce equipment malfunction. These facts point to shortcomings of maintenance in the face of increasing equipment complexity, and emphasize the urgent need for equipments designed for simplicity of operation and servicing. Laboratory analysis by Cornell University indicates that high-operating temperature is the predominant basic cause of deterioration failures resulting from emission poisoning, interface, and leakage due to sublimation. Heater burnout and heater-cathode shorts, the principal types of catastrophic failures, are traceable to highheater operating temperature. Early results of ARINC tests on improved receiving-type tubes indicate a removal rate only one-third to one-fourth that of their prototypes, which show a rate between one and three per cent per hundred hours of operation. Correction of tube weaknesses appears to lie in diligent application of solutions which are already known. The improvements must be maintained by rigid quality control of the product and continuous sampling of failures occurring under actual operating conditions."
"An experimental and theoretical study is presented which shows that the current gain of an alloy transistor is greatly affected by the geometry of emitter and collector junctions and by surface treatment of the base germanium, but is hardly affected at all by bulk recombination (lifetime) in the base. The current gain is computed for specific three-dimensional geometries by an electric analog method which assumes that surface recombination is the major factor in minority-carrier loss. By this method, a new way of measuring surface-recombination velocity, s, from simple measurements on transistors has been devised. The value of s is obtained directly from a suitable calibration curve, and thus may be useful as a quality control on surface condition. The transit-time path-length dispersion of minority carriers in a transistor structure with nonparallel junctions has been computed. The results show that the effect is significant only above 1 mc/second in a typical structure."
"Existing theories of the junction transistor fail to predict the very significant variation of current-amplification factor, αcb, as the emitter current is varied. This variation has been very troublesome in power transistors, particularly at high emitter currents where the αcb fall-off may be so severe as to limit usefulness. At low currents, αcb also drops off, an effect of importance in very low-power applications. By taking into account modification of the base region by the injected charge carriers, an explanation is found for the observed variation. Electric fields in the base region decrease the mean transit time for minority carriers on their way to the collector. This reduces the effect of surface recombination and increases current-amplification factor as the emitter current rises. Another effect, however, is in the opposite direction; this second effect is due to an increase in conductivity of the base material which increases the rate of volume recombination and also lowers emitter efficiency. The combination of these effects yields calculated curves which show a maximum and agree well with experiment. The work is applicable to both p-n-p and n-p-n types, and it is shown that the latter is inherently less sensitive to emitter current density."
"This paper considers methods for measuring the piezoelectric, dielectric, and elastic coefficients of crystals and ceramics and recommends certain preferred methods of measurement. Static measurements are not considered to be as satisfactory as dynamic measurements. Of the dynamic methods, measurements of the resonant and anti-resonant frequencies, the low frequency capacitance and the resistance at resonance appear to be the simplest and most accurate method, provided that the ratio of Q/r is high. Quasi-static methods are useful for crystals having a low ratio of Q/r, for determining the sign of the piezoelectric coefficients, and for production checks. Hydrostatic methods are useful for complicated crystals such as monoclinic types and for measuring a sum of two of the coefficients of electrostrictive ceramics. This measurement can be carried out for odd-shaped samples."
"A traveling-wave tube whose circuit supports a backward wave having oppositely directed phase and group velocities has been found to exhibit narrow-band regenerative-type gain. For low beam currents the tube acts as a high-gain, high Q, voltage-tunable filter. As the beam current is increased, the tube breaks into oscillations whose frequency may be shifted to any point in the structure pass band merely by changing beam voltage. An analysis is carried out which predicts some of the small-signal operating characteristics of the backward-wave tube. Numerical solutions are presented for the start-oscillation conditions including circuit loss and space charge."
"A model is presented for the interpretation of point-contact transistor switching phenomena. The assumption is made that the frequency cut-off is high when the transistor is not saturated and low when saturated. The low-frequency response in saturation can explain qualitatively the anomalous pulse requirements for switching transistors from saturation to cutoff. Some switching criteria are derived and the one-shot multivibrator is discussed."
"A method is presented for evaluating dual diversity receivig systems by relating the characteristics of the receiving equipment to the signal levels at both receiving antennas. The characteristics of the receiving equipment are described by relating the quality of the output traffic to the input signal level. The input signal levels are in turn described in terms of the bivariate Rayleigh probability distribution function. The method is sufficiently general to enable extension to evaluate triple diversity systems and is independent of the frequency range over which diversity fading phenomena occur. The method can also be simplified to examine the over-all effectiveness of a nondiversity receiving system."
"An analysis of the response of a panoramic receiver to cw and pulse signals is presented. The receiver's response is studied quantitatively as a function of the parameters: signal-pulse length and frequency, receiver bandwidth, sweep-rate, and type of IF amplifier. The effect of these parameters on the relative output amplitude, output pulse width, and apparent bandwidth is emphasized. Two specific cases are considered. An electronic differential analyzer is used to study the response of a receiver with a single-tuned IF amplifier to pulses having rectangular envelopes. Theoretically the response of a receiver with a Gaussian shaped IF pass-band to pulses having Gaussian envelopes is derived. This answer is given in closed form. The agreement between these two cases justifies the application of the Gaussian case to most practical design problems."
"A study was made of the mutual coupling between two resonant waveguide fed slots on a finite ground plane. The size of the ground plane and the relative spacing of the slots were such that the geometry corresponded to that of a pair of adjacent longitudinal shunt slots on the broad face of a rectangular waveguide. A null bridge method of measurement was used to determine accurately the relative field strength excited in the second waveguide by mutual coupling between the slots when the generator was applied to the first waveguide. The change in input slot admittance of the driven slot arising from the presence of the parasitic slot was also measured for matched terminations of the ends of the parasitic slot waveguide. The changes in slot input admittance and excitation arising from mutual coupling were determined. It is shown that the changes may be neglected in the design of the great majority of linear-slot arrays."
"The transient responses of a number of glow discharges were observed. From the response time of several microseconds, and the characteristic overshoot, they can be described as having an inductive component approaching a henry. This is consistent with the observed frequency response. It is shown how standard neon lamps can be used as fast and noiseless coupling elements for voltage level changing in direct coupled circuits, in spite of the above."

"This paper describes a laboratory-model AM broadcast receiver which used nine alloy-junction transistors and two compensating diodes. Six of the transistors were of the laboratory p-n-p type, designed for radio-frequency amplifiers, and three of the transistors were of the conventional p-n-p type selected for Class B audio driver and output service. The use of Class B output permitted a total battery drain below 12 milliamperes from six 1.5-volt type C cells in series. The battery life was approximately 500 hours, and the battery cost relatively small. The maximum audio-power output was 150 milliwatts into a four-inch by six-inch oval speaker. The sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio were comparable to that of conventional battery-operated receivers and conventional ac-dc receivers. The receiver may be used in the place of ac-dc receivers without the necessity of a power outlet or a connecting power cord at a battery cost approximately the same as the cost of power for an ac-dc receiver."
"The Columbia Broadcasting System recently inaugurated television program service from its new Hollywood Television City headquarters. The engineering and architectural design of this modem television broadcasting plant is based upon a flexible and expansible master plan that provides for the ultimate construction of 24 studio units. The initial construction phase now completed provides two audience and two nonaudience studios, each exceeding one-quarter acre in area, together with the necessary technical, production, scenery construction, and office facilities to completely support CBS-Hollywood television operations. This paper describes the philosophy underlying the design of the video, audio, and communication facilities for this project. Emphasis is placed on description of methods and features that are new or novel."
"This paper describes an experimental 2,000-megacycle traveling-wave power amplifier designed for operation at electrode voltages below 700 volts. This tube is capable of delivering a power output of 7.6 w at a gain of 20 db and a power output of 3 w at a gain of 28 db at the optimum operating point. Maximum power outputs from 4 to 7.6 w at gains ranging from 17 to 21 db have been measured over a bandwidth of 650 mc (1,700 to 2,350 mc). Electronic efficiencies of 20 per cent and collector efficiencies close to 30 per cent have been obtained with this amplifier. Results obtained with the tube operating as a frequency shifter are discussed. A design including a permanent magnet for electron-beam focusing has been developed."
"This paper describes briefly rocket-borne electronic equipment which has been developed and utilized in the determination of ambient atmospheric pressure and temperature. In the design of the equipment, emphasis has been placed on reliability of operation, and on the ability to produce data of significant accuracy. Typical resulting curves of ambient pressure and temperature are presented."
"Practical and theoretical considerations involved in the application of semiconductors as passive logarithmic elements are discussed. Simple voltage-divider circuits incorporating semiconductors exhibiting special characteristics are used to obtain output voltages proportional to the logarithms of input voltages, with emphasis on the dc case. Data are presented on the logarithmic response, and temperature dependence of a number of specific types of rectifiers. Reasonably good temperature compensation of such circuits can be achieved with negative temperature coefficient resistors. Circuits having a logarithmic response have been demonstrated for input signals from dc up to 100 kilocycles in frequency."
"The following paper describes experimental and theoretical studies on a new phenomenon of microwave detection and conversion. Vacuum-tube diodes are used, but operating with very large electron-transit angles. It is shown that the cumulative energy received from the microwave field causes electrons to move out of the space charge region more rapidly than under dc conditions. This accounts for the detection and conversion action of the diode when a microwave signal is radiated into the interelectrode space."
"The first theorem desctibes the change in the admittance matrix corresponding to the change of the voltage reference terminal (\"ground\" terminal). The second theorem shows that the determinant of the admittance matrix is invariant under such transformations."
"Part I: Synthesis of Immittances with Two Poles and Two Zeros. Cauer's continued-fraction technique is generalized for use in realizing RLC network immittances. Using this method, element values are determined by simple processes of \"forward\" and \"reverse\" division. Immittances F(p) with two poles and zeros may be grouped in three classes according to the frequency jωm at which Re F(jω) is a minimum. For Class I, ωm= 0; for Class II, ωm = ∞; and for Class III, ∞m is finite. Class I and II F(p) can be realized immediately by making a continued-fraction expansion. If both F(p) and 1/F(p) are Class III, to obtain a realization without unity-coupled coils the function must be split into two terms which may then be expanded in continued fractions. Simple formulas are presented which enable one to easily classify F(p) and determine an appropriate realization method. Part II: A Constant-Resistance Ladder for Transfer Function Synthesis. The physical factors that determine the poles and zeros of a transfer function are examined. By use of physical insight, a design procedure for a constant-resistance ladder network is arrived at. This ladder network is found to have the same realm of application as the conventional, RLC, constant-resistance bridged-T. However, the ladder has the advantages of: fewer elements, more flexibility, and requiring less flat loss if the bridged-T requires flat loss. Complicated transfer functions may be realized in a chain of ladder sections having arm immittances with only two poles and two zeros."
"A bifilar helix used as the slow wave circuit for the backward-wave oscillator is investigated in this paper. Calculations show that the bifilar helix has a higher impedance than that of the ordinary single-wire helix. The propagating characteristics of the bifilar helix are analyzed and some experimental results of cold measurements are presented. It is also shown that with a bifilar helix, a periodic electrostatic field which can be used to focus the electron stream is readily obtained by applying a proper dc potential difference between two helical wires. The same bifilar structure may thus be used both for the propagating and for the focusing circuit. A tube of this kind has been constructed and the experimental results are described."
"Narrow-band radio-frequency amplifiers and mixers may be stabilized by negative feedback without increasing the bandwidth excessively. A couple using current feedback is described. This couple requires only a simple resistive beta circuit and may be designed such that the band-pass characteristic is largely independent of the feedback. Consideration is given to the problem of input impedance and a design procedure is outlined. A discussion of the experimental results concludes the paper."
"Calculations are made of the electron trajectories in infinite strip beams constrained to move in a magnetic fleld parallel to the direction of flow. Space charge is taken into account, but nevertheless the analysis is only valid within certain well-defined limits. Different types of solution are obtained according to whether the beam is launched from a source outside or inside the magnetic fleld. When the gun is outside the field the type of flow also depends on whether the current is greater or less than a certain value. In all cases the beamwidth varies periodically along the length of the beam, and expressions for the periodicity and the ratio of maximum to minimum width are obtained. Both fundamental and practical limitations are then considered, and their effects on the electron flow discussed qualitatively. The importance of conditions outside the beam boundary is emphasized."
"Three different types of high-speed transistor shift registers are discussed. The high speed (3 to 5 microseconds per shift pulse) is made possible by the use of nonsaturating bistable circuits. Two general shift registers are described making use of respectively one and two transistors per stage. The third register is of a specialized variety capable of shifting a single digit. In addition, an analysis is made of the triggering requirements of the register using a single transistor per stage."
"This paper presents a discussion of the concepts involved in the use of \"comb\" filters for signal-to-noise improvement in pulsed radar systems. A \"comb\" filter is one whose frequency spectrum consists of a number of equi-spaced elements resembling the tines of a comb. Consideration is given to the characteristics of the frequency spectra arising from sequences of pulses varying in number from one to infinity. These results indicate that the use of comb filters may be feasible in most cases. Hence, a study is made of the use of three different types of filters to determine their effect on the signal-to-noise ratio. These filters range from the simplest type of uniform filters to the North type of matched filter. The relative merits of these filters are determined in terms of improvement in signal-to-noise ratio."
"The performance of radars in storm detection is studied in a manner designed to help in the choice of the proper wavelength for the radar. Decreasing the wavelength increases the range in clear air, but the attenuation associated with the shortened wavelength cuts down appreciably the ability of the radar to look through intervening rain. It is concluded that for the certain detection of operationally significant storms, wavelengths shorter than about 5 cm should not be used."
"General solutions are obtained for three- and four-section phase-shift networks. These solutions are reduced to design equations for a number of specific circuit configurations, and the complete solution is given for a four-section phase-shift oscillator, including effects of plate-load resistance, and input-miller capacity."
"The system gain and radiation pattern of a passive reflector antenna system (with a 45-degree plane rectangular reflector) are developed from aperture field theory. Experimentally determined system gains and a measured radiation pattern substantiate the theoretical analysis. Side-lobe levels and mutual coupling are also discussed."
"The network equations for determining mutual impedance between a pair of radiating elements are analyzed and a new equation is determined in which the mutual impedance is expressed in terms of the self-impedances of the radiating elements and a new parameter designated as the radiation mutual-coupling factor Mr. A technique is outlined whereby this new parameter can be isolated and accurately measured despite the presence of discontinuities at the base of the radiating element to which a slotted line is connected. The technique is demonstrated for the case of a pair of identical quarter-wave monopoles and the results compared with the theroetical values interpolated from King's approximate second-order solution. The technique is then applied to the case of a pair of identical axial mode helical radiators."
"Diversity methods are used to reduce receiving errors caused by carrier fading; for a keyed signal, such errors are easily specified in terms of the binary error. The attainable reduction in error depends upon the type of diversity selection used at the receiver. Several selection methods are examined, and the binary error is calculated for each, assuming narrow-band FSK transmission, fluctuation noise interference, and a Rayleigh distribution of carrier amplitudes. The results are used to determine the equivalent carrier-to-noise power gain for each diversity method. A numerical example is given in conclusion."

"The most powerful radio broadcasting station in Europe began regular operation in August, 1953. The unique features include a 5.2 million watt complete diesel power station with fuel oil storage of 264,000 gallons. A \"vapor phase system\" cools the diesel engines. Transmitter metering, tuning, and power controls are centralized in a console type unit. The output of dual high powered transmitters are normally combined, but can be fed separately to the antenna system and dummy load. The over-all efficiency of the transmitter from power source to antenna is over 50 per cent and is unusually stable under extremely heavy modulation. The high-efficiency amplifier employs thoriated-tungsten filament triodes with a power gain of 33. The transmitter-output load has parallel-resonant symmetry. The 12-inch coaxial transmission line feeds an 837-foot top loaded tower optimized fof maximum ground wave. The extensive ground system extends out 0.5 mile from the tower and consists of over 100 miles of no. 6 copper wire."
"Transistor oscillators, including Colpitts and Hartley types, have been analyzed using the low-frequency equivalent circuit for the transistor. Conditions for sustained oscillations and expressions for the frequency of oscillation and for the stability of this frequency with variation in transistor parameters have been derived for these circuits. In addition, reactance-stabilization conditions have been determined following the method which Llewellyn has applied to vacuum-tube oscillators."
"A new multitransit-electron tube is described, having high efficiency and an exceptionally wide electronic tuning range. An important feature of the tube is a trochoidal electron drift motion at right angles to the radio-frequency field, serving to remove electrons from the field at a favorable instant."
"Two laboratory models of a single-sideband modulator are described. The frequency of a microwave signal is shifted by means of a rotating magnetic field transverse to a ferrite differential half-wave section. The first laboratory model, a transmission device, is inserted in a waveguide-transmission line. The second model, which is a reflection device, reflects signals from a source. Either modulator shifts the microwave-carrier frequency of 9,375 mc by plus or minus 20 kc. Differential half-wave sections are shown to be possible from Polder's explanation of double refraction of plane electromagnetic waves propagated in an infinitely large ferromagnetic medium magnetized transverse to the direction of propagation."
"A developmental germanium power transistor is described. The collector heat dissipation is 20 watts at room temperature when the transistor is properly mounted. The unit delivers a peak collector current in the order of 1 ampere and has a peak collector voltage of 60 volts. Problems concerning heat transfer and mounting are discussed. Electrical characteristics for 75 degrees F. and 175 degrees F. mounting base temperature are given."
"Theoretical formulas are given for the attenuation constants of Clogston laminated coaxial cables, together with illustrative numerical examples and charts in which the parameters are not too far outside the realm of present manufacturing possibility. In the first section the metal losses in a Clogston cable are discussed and compared with the losses in a conventional coaxial cable, and optimum proportions for the laminated cable are suggested. The second and third sections deal respectively with dielectric losses and the effects of nonuniformity in laminated cables."
"Radio relay paths with strong ground reflections experience more fading than similar paths with negligible ground reflections. In order to minimize fading the route survey for the transcontinental microwave-relay system included measurements, of ground reflection coefficients on most of the proposed repeater sections. In most cases the reflection coefficients at 4,000 mc were in the range from 0.2-0.4. Attempts to correlate these results with the path proflles and to obtain a suitable theoretical explanation indicate that no simple relation exists but that a statistical relationship can be found to fit the observed data."
"The usual method of array design, which employs pattern multiplication, is an approximation which is often adequate but which never predicts exactly the pattern of any practical array. An exact method is discussed. It is compared with the approximate method by applying both methods to a practical array of travelingwave slot antennas. The results show that while pattern multiplication is useful for obtaining a first approximation, the exact method must be employed for arrays which are to be designed for low side lobes."
"A vacuum tube or a transistor, operating linearly under small-signal conditions, may be represented as a resistive (i.e., nonreactive) 3-terminal network element. Such an element may be considered as composed of a triangle of resistors and a 3-terminal gyrator. If the element is active, at least one resistor is negative. The activity or passivity of the element is shown to be dependent on the three resistors, while the reciprocity relation is obeyed or violated according to whether the gyrator is absent or present respectively. It is also shown that an active 3-terminal element cannot obey reciprocity and remain stable, so that the gyrator has a stabilizing effect. Some general relations are derived concerning 3-terminal active elements. These relations apply to any active element that is described by a 3-terminal resistive network, without regard to the physical principles underlying its operation."
"The high-frequency compensation of single- and multistage resistance-coupled amplifiers is discussed with special reference to the transient response. Optimum parameters are given for a number of typical cases. It is shown that, for the simplest type of high-frequency compensation with one coil in the anode lead, staggering of the time constants in a multistage amplifier reduces the rise time to less than 45 per cent of the uncompensated value, as against a reduction to between 55 and 60 per cent for the case of identical stages. Other practical design considerations are also discussed."
"The function of a power-spectrum analyzer is to predict from a single finite length of wave record, which has the statistical properties of filtered random noise (e.g. ocean wave, turbulence etc.), the average power per unit bandwidth of an ensemble of such records at various frequencies. The signal derived from repeating the record is heterodyned with another signal whose frequency is scanned at a uniform rate across the entire spectrum and the resultant wave is passed through a narrow filter and then detected by a square-law detector. Two problems arise: 1. Due to its finite bandwidth, the filter performs a necessary weighted average on the power spectrum. What is the best filter response to minimize the intrinsic error associated with the prediction of an average characteristic of an ensemble from a single record? What practical filter is closest to the ideally best? 2. How fast can the frequency be scanned without appreciably deviating the filter response? Definite solutions are given to the above problems. Eqs. (26) and (27) together with Table I give the lowest probable error for filters with various shapes of response curve. Eq. (32) defines the ideal fliter which minimizes this error. The ideal filter can be very closely approximated by cascading a single resonant circuit to a pair of critically coupled resonant circuits with a Q-value √2 times that of the former."
"The purpose of the following is to analyze the performance of a magnetic core when a field Hy is applied perpendicular to the direction of the residual magnetization Jr, in particular to evaluate the magnitude of Jr after the applied field is removed."
"This paper comprises studies made in formulating criteria for the elimination of false echoes in line-type radar pulsers. Equations and curves are derived for predicting the presence or absence of echoes in a given pulser. Experimental tests approximately verify the curves for pulses of 4-microseconds duration. A list of symbols used in the discussion appears at the end of the paper."
"A simple theory of the conditions for oscillation, and of the frequency stability of inductance-capacitance oscillators is evolved from a survey of a number of papers on this subject. As some of these papers appeared in publications which are not readily accessible, some of the material may be new to workers in the United States. The condition for oscillation is shown to depend only upon the mutual conductance of the tube and the impedances, tapped on the tuned circuit, presented to the grid and plate circuits of the tube. For linear operation, the stability depends only on the Q of the controlling circuit, and the ratio of the change of interelectrode capacitance to mutual conductance of the tube, and is independent of the LC ratio. For nonlinear operation, however, the stability depends upon the factors given above and on the LC ratio, being improved when a high LC ratio is used. The best tube for high stability is shown to be the tube having the lowest ratio of interelectrode capacitance change to mutual conductance. For highest possible stability, very low level operation with some form of automatic level control is required. A brief historical chronology is included."
"High-precision quartz crystal resonators were recently added as a part of the primary standard of frequency at the National Bureau of Standards. Their reliability over short and long periods of time resulted in establishment of a frequency and time reference system constant to 1 part in 1010 per day. Measurement equipment and methods, are described in detail. The equivalent circuit for the crystal unit is discussed and the effects of external influences such as stray capacitance, electric and magnetic fields, connecting cables, ambient temperatures, and amplitude of vibration are considered. An assessment method is discussed. This method is based on the fitting of a natural aging or drift curve for each resonator to an observed curve after sufficient performance data are obtained. The use of resonators with crystal clocks represents one of the simplest and most reliable and economical methods of establishing a precise frequency reference in terms of mean solar time and of noting deviations in the earth's rate of rotation."
"There are numerous applications in electronics for a device which will derive \"instantaneously\" the logarithm of an applied function. If this operation can be accomplished accurately, the device has wide application in analog computing, for multiplying, dividing, and determining ratios. In addition, whenever compression of a wide dynamic range of signal levels into a restricted presentation range is desired, such a device is in general optimum. This paper shows how any arbitrary number of points distributed uniformly in amplitude may be made to fit a logarithmic response by means of the \"successive detection\" principle and how the deviation from true logarithmic response between these points can be essentially eliminated by use of the \"multiple level detection\" technique. The use of dc degeneration in an IF amplifier to stabilize tube characteristics is demonstrated, and three highly precise logarithmic receivers with bandwidths of 1.8 to 9 mc are described."
"To obtain an approximate solution for the fields in a coaxial line with a helical inner conductor, the helix is replaced by a fictitious surface that is conducting only in the helix direction, an approximation used in the early work on traveling-wave tubes. Maxwell's equations are solved for the lowest \"mode\" (all fields independent of angle) when the medium inside the helix has permittivity and permeability different from that of the medium surrounding the helix. Equations for the velocity along the axis, characteristic impedance, attenuation constant, and Q are given. The significant parameter is (2πNa) (2πa/λ). N=number of turns per unit length, α = helix radius, and λ = wavelength. When this parameter is considerably less than 1, the velocity and characteristic impedance depend only on the dimensions. The dielectric inside the helix has only a second-order effect, while the dielectric outside the helix has a first-order effect. The wave appears to propagate along the helix wire with the velocity of light only when the outer conductor is very close to the helix; as the outer-conductor diameter is increased, the apparent velocity along the wire gradually increases and reaches a limiting value when the outer conductor is infinitely large. For the shapes generally used, the apparent velocity along the wire is rarely more than 30 per cent greater than the velocity of light, but with an infinitely large outer conductor this velocity can be 2 or 3 times the velocity of light."

"Two thyratron considerations are (1) spurious noise output, and (2) speed and ease with which the anode current can be tuned on and off. The spurious noise output of conventional thyratrons often is such that they cannot be operated close to sensitive communications equipment. In addition, while the anode current can be established in a fraction of a microsecond, current interruption often requires times of the order of 100 microseconds. During this time one is confronted with the additional disadvantage of having to remove the anode voltage. The tacitron, a new thyratron whose construction and operation are herein described and analyzed, is so quiet in operation that it can be operated in close proximity to sensitive communications equipment without noticeable interference. Furthermore, its anode current can be switched on or off in about one microsecond without the necessity of anode voltage removal. With respect to arc drop, over-all efficiency, tube construction, and other salient characteristics the tube is similar to conventional ones. The tacitron owes its unusual capabilities mainly to a grid design that insures tube operation in a unique discharge mode where in ion generation takes place solely in the grid-anode region. Besides being useful in applications in which conventional thyratrons are now used, this new tube offers the possibility of use in many new applications presently denied conventional thyratrons, either because of noise or recovery time considerations. This includes computers and all sorts of pulse circuits."
"An ionic conduction process in the multilayers of water adsorbed on a germanium n-p junction bar is proposed to explain the increase in reverse dark current observed when the relative humidity to which the unit is exposed is increased. Experimental evidence supporting this postulate is given and discussed."
"Surface conduction channels on both the n-type and the p-type region of a p-n junction of germanium have been produced and investigated. Channels on the n-type region were produced by an oxygen rich surface environment and those on the p-side were produced by high humidity. At an intermediate, 75 per cent relative humidity, a condition of high surface leakage and no channel was found. A model, based on bending of energy levels at the surface to produce opposite type majority carrier conductivity than is found for the body of the germanium is used to explain the results. The particular channels studied simulate trouble conditions in transistor fabrication and in reliability problems and provide a good linkage for explanation of anomalous effects that are frequently found."
"Measurements have been made on grown germanium p-n junction diodes in an attempt to correlate the excess reverse current that occurs under exposure to water vapor with the presence of an n-type surface-conductivity layer, or \"channel,\" on the p-side of the junction. Using an optical method to measure the length of this surface layer, it has been found that (1) no channel is formed on a freshly CP4-etched surface, and that (2) for well-oxidized surfaces, large excess reverse currents occur which are directly proportional to the length of the channel for all measured values of applied voltage and humidity. By combining this observation with the known behavior of the channel conductivity with humidity and voltage, a formula for the excess current as a function of the applied bias is derived. In spite of several oversimplifications in the model, the predicted values agree reasonably well with the experimental results for biases greater than one volt."
"A method is shown for approximating the significance of color television-receiver errors to color reproduction. For representative colors, the deviations in chromaticity caused by errors in various signals are evaluated in terms of MacAdam's unit of equal noticeability. An experimental investigation of viewer tolerances is reported."
"Propagation on a. helix as a function of frequency is characterized by ranges in which there is a slow wave which can be explained as very nearly a transverse electromagnetic wave traveling along the wire, and ranges in which the helix does not propagate; these are associated with \"forbidden regions\" of propagation constant pointed out by Sensiper. Each mode of propagation consists of an infinite number of spatial Fourier components called spatial harmonics. The complicated behavior with frequency of the modes of a helix is explained as an effect of the coupling through spatial harmonics of the slow wave which travels with about the velocity of light along the wire to fast free-space or waveguide waves which travel with about the velocity of light along the axis. The qualitative effects of such coupling agree with a tape-helix analysis of helixes in free space and helixes surrounded by a conducting tube. The case of the bifflar helix is also treated."
"This paper deals with the general problem of detecting television signals in thermal noise and with the methods of improving the performance of the second detector. A method of computing the thermal-noise spectrum and signal-to-noise ratios following the diode detector for the video and intercarrier-sound signals is described and experimentally verified. It is shown that the diode-detection process for very weak signals suppresses the desired video modulation and, in effect, creates additional noise above that introduced by the input stages. The principal factors for a given frequency component of the detected signal, are found to be the carrier-to-noise ratio, and the frequency response of the rf and IF amplifiers preceding the detector. Although the television viewpoint is emphasized, this analysis is particularly useful in analyzing the detection process of other AM transmission systems which use complex IF responses and several subcarriers. The theoretical and subjective aspects of improving the detection process are discussed, and a method of predicting the performance for some of the improved detection schemes is developed. Two improved detection circuits, an exalted-carrier IF and a product detector, which were constructed and tested, are described. It is found that such detection systems are capable of small improvements for very weak signals. 1, 1954."

"It is shown that the 2D2/λ antenna criterion ensures a phase variation less than π/8 and an amplitude variation less than 10 per cent over D when using a paraboloidal or optimum horn antenna for illumination, providing its aperture dimensions do not exceed D. The pattern of a uniform line antenna illuminated by such a paraboloid is shown to be essentially the same as its conventional pattern (point source illumination). It is also shown that the appropriate criterion for back scattering patterns is 4D2/λ. earch Foundation."
"A broadband, low-power, automatic impedance recorder of good accuracy has been developed for the X-band frequency range. The instrument will accept any impedance which has an X-band waveguide input and will plot an ink graph of either the impedance or the admittance upon a standard Smith type impedance chart. If the test impedance is one of low mismatch, the instrument can be switched to an expanded Smith chart scale and thus provide greater plotting accuracy near the matched condition. The plane of impedance measurement, or \"reference terminals,\" of the instrument may be located at any point desired along the waveguide transmission line leading to the test impedance and will remain fixed for all frequencies in the operating band. An rf impedance circuit utilizing broadband waveguide components extracts the amplitude and phase information which operates electromechanical servos in the amplifier-recorder unit. The components presently in use give an operating bandwidth from 8400 mc to 9900 mc, and the arrangement is such that the system will operate on any incident rf power level within the range of about 20 to 250 milliwatts. Everyday laboratory use of the instrument by both professional and nonprofessional personnel has shown it to be accurate, reliable, and a great time saver. . Lab., Washington, D.C., August, 1953."
"The ultimate performance of space-charge deflection tubes is investigated in several respects and a comparison is made with pentodes and multiplier tubes using essentially the same tube structure. Noise may be considerably lower than for conventional multiplier tubes and almost equal to that of pentodes. The transconductance-to-current ratio may surpass the value for conventional tubes by a factor of 2-10. The high-frequency behavior is inferior to that of pentodes. The stability of transconductance may be higher and distortion lower than for conventional multiplier tubes and even pentodes. The current drain may be lower than that of a pentode."
"A study of coding to reduce the frequency of errors in communication systems which transmit data at a constant rate has been started. A new single-error-correcting code (the Wagner code) is described and analyzed. Its performance in a constant-data-rate system is evaluated and compared with Hamming's single-error-correcting code. The Wagner code is superior for many communication applications. Its successful implementation does not require too precise equipment."
"The paper concerns the mathematical analysis of an experimentally-developed, four-terminal network consisting of a resistor-capacitor-chopper combination. The circuit is essentially a simple, low-pass rc filter, modified by the insertion of a periodically-conducting bilinear element. The circuit receives a modulated sinusoidal carrier, filters the modulation, and transmits the resulting signal as a series of amplitude-modulated rectangular pulses. The reed driving coil of the chopper is separately excited by a sinusoidal voltage of carrier frequency so that the pulse repetition rate of the output pulses is equal to the frequency of the input carrier. The analysis takes into account the \"dead time\" of the chopper and admits an arbitrary choice of phase difference between the input carrier voltage and the chopper-reed excitation voltage. An equivalent circuit is derived from response of circuit to an input carrier of fixed amplitude. A formula is obtained for equivalent circuit-time constant, and a condition for minimum attenuation is also derived. May 10, 1954."
"Optical automatic devices, using ambient light only, can locate and range objects up to about 100 feet. Shallow real images of the objects are formed by a wide-aperture lens in an image space where a moving vane with minute bars and slots periodically cuts across all light rays in one image plane after another. Whenever the bars coincide with a sharp image they modulate the light received by a photocell. Range information may be read on a meter or control directly a range-following servo mechanism. A small hand-held guidance device for the blind is described. It is used for probing like a flashlight but operates on ambient light when that exceeds one foot-candle. Image space is explored several times per second by a helical vane with bars spaced the closer the nearer the objects whose image they intercept. A photo-multiplier and audio amplifier feed the resulting whistle-modulation to an earphone, 8 frequencies corresponding to 8 ranges from 20 inches to 20 feet. A motor turns the vane, also a chopper to supply via transformer and twentyfold voltage multiplier 1000 volts dc to the electron multiplier; total consumption is 50 ma from one 1.5v cell. , pp. 102-105; April, 1950."

"Knowledge of the wave shapes and frequencies of the normal functions (or standing waves) of air and iron-core coils, transformer windings, and generator windings is of fundamental importance for the study of the response of these structures to impulse voltages and switching surges. In this paper the normal functions are determined for the cases of grounded and isolated neutral for the fundamental oscillations only. The mutual inductance between all turns of the winding is taken into account, by solving an integral equation, wherein the kernel depends upon the mutual inductance function. Examples are given for air and iron-core coils, and transformer windings, both uniform and non-uniform. Computed wave shapes and frequencies compare satisfactorily with measurements."
"This paper presents an analysis of the transients that occur when voltage is suddenly applied across the terminals of an induction motor, with and without a connected capacitor. In wound rotor motors, the transient currents are reduced by connecting resistance in the rotor circuit, but transient voltages then appear across the slip rings. Both current and voltage transients are increased when capacitors are connected across the stator terminals. Calculated curves and test oscillograms are given for the transient currents when voltage was applied to the terminals of a 4-pole 3,000-horsepower wound rotor induction motor, with an external resistance across the slip rings, with and without a capacitor. The calculations and tests confirm the wellknown rule that, when there is an appreciable reactance between the power source and the motor, and when voltage is suddenly applied, the peak transient voltage on the motor capacitor unit will rise above the steady-state voltage. If the capacitor kilovolt-amperes (kva) exceed the motor magnetizing kva, the steady-state voltage will be higher than the source voltage, and the motor voltage will also rise above its steady-state value when the motor is disconnected. It is shown that the capacitor increases the time constant of voltage decay by the factor v/1-Kv2, approximately, where K is the ratio of capacitor to magnetizing kva, and v is the per unit motor speed. If Kv2>1, E builds up instead of decaying."
"The growth in size and complexity of power systems has resulted in a trend toward multiwinding power transformers. A frequent consideration in the application of these multiwinding transformers is the possibility of paralleling secondary windings. This paper is a study of the impedance relations and winding arrangements necessary to secure proper paralleling. Use is made of both equivalent circuits and the fundamental transformer equations. The mesh network, although unwieldy for many circuit problems is ideal for visualizing the suitability of specific winding arrangements for paralleling. If the impedance links between the supply terminal and all the secondary terminals are equal, the secondaries will divide load equally when paralleled. While equivalent circuits can be used to establish the impedance relations for transformers with relatively few windings, the n-winding transformer can be handled more effectively by returning to the transformer equations. Although the treatment of the problem is presented in terms of a single supply winding with a multiplicity of paralleled secondaries, it applies equally well to a group of paralleled supply windings feeding a single loaded secondary."
"Inner cooling of high-voltage generator stator coils1,2 has made possible greatly increased ratings for the active magnetic and conductor materials in large hydrogen-cooled machines. This major advance in cooling. technique has required modification in some insulation design practices and application methods. It is the purpose of this paper to review the insulation of large inner-cooled generators and to re-examine the basic insulation methods and concepts. Test data on models and insulating structures in hydrogen at various pressures are reported. The philosophy for design of creepage distances across insulating surfaces and striking distances through gas is discussed."
"A numerical study has been made which shows the effect of shunt loads on the steady-state stability limit of a power system. In particular, the effect of the load characteristic, i.e. constant impedance, or constant current, or constant power, was considered. In general, the study shows shunt loads to have a stabilizing effect on the system except when the load is heavy, nearly constant power in nature, close to a machine which supplies a minor part of the loads requirement, and poorly connected to the rest of the system. On the basis of this study and a-c network analyzer tests, a simplified method for determining the stability limit is developed and presented herein. Equations for the stability limit are also presented."
"The contact between a carbon brush and a revolving commutator is assumed, in the accepted theories of commutation, to be constant in position and length of arc, but it is not always so in practice. This results in unexpectedly poor machine performance in certain circumstances. It can seriously impair commutation, make it impossible to run machines in parallel, cause instability of speed and output, and selective collection of current. This paper is an account of the theories evolved to explain these undesirable phenomena, the methods of overcoming them and improving machine performance. Comparisons are made between single, tandem, and split brushes. The powerful effect of circumferential stagger is also shown, both in overcoming the instability of the arc of contact and in masking the effect of commutator surface irregularities."
"The wide use of induction motors in the home, the office, and the factory requires that they both look and sound well. The pleasing, if not downright handsome, appearance of present-day motors attests to the skill of the appearance-design experts who have worked with motor engineers in recent years. There is now a growing demand that motors should have good \"sonance design\" also. They should give out a steady pleasing hum, just loud enough to show that they are performing their duties properly, but not loud enough to be noticed. This paper describes the magnetic forces that cause the magnetic noise of polyphase induction motors, and the corresponding modes of motion of the motor cores and frames. Approximate equations are derived for the decibel sound levels that motors of normal design may be expected to produce, and variations due to core and frame resonance are discussed. The two principal types of magnetic noise, due to the radial forces of the fundamental air gap field, and the tooth frequency pulsations of these forces, are considered separately."
"In a previous paper [ibid., vol. 72, pt. III, June 1953, pp. 562-71], the authors presented the results of a study of the performance of two interconnected steam-electric power-generating areas as affected by frequency and tie-line power controllers. The present paper extends this study to include hydroelectric power generating areas as well. As before, the object is to determine theoretically the best values of controller gains, that is, to find those controller settings that will result in best over-all system performance. The principal criterion of good performance is, also as before, the minimizing of any oscillations in tie-line power or system frequency resulting from load disturbances to either area. Thus, stability, rather than rapidity of response, is preferred, since the system actually is continually being disturbed by small and more or less random changes of load, rather than by the step load change used as a test disturbance in the study."
"In this paper \"accuracy\" means confining error to the lowest practicable level. Similarly, \"simplicity\" means shortness in calculations. Properties that can be shortened with accuracy are the running and starting characteristics. One main conclusion of this paper is that running power factor and efficiency may be obtained with the same accuracy as by present methods, but with greater speed. Another main conclusion is that an accuracy of 0.5% isattainable in torque and current calculations in the starting range, provided more accurate values of end-turn reactance are forthcoming, and with considerable saving of time in calculations. The various sections of this paper may be grouped in three broad classifications: 1) The papers presented at the symposium of the AIEE Middle Eastern District Meeting, Toledo, OH, USA (28-30 Oct 1952), are reviewed, a selection is made of the primitive circuit having least probable error, and a research program mentioned. 2) A new network theorem is proved which aids in the simplification of circuits. 3) A new method of computing skin effect in the bottom cage is given. This will be of use for bars not over 1/2 inch in depth."
"Test and calculated speed-torque curves are given for two 3-phase induction motors with part-winding starting. A 6-pole 300-horsepower (hp) motor was tested with three different winding arrangements: 1. full winding; 2. part winding, omitting alternate phase belts; and 3, part winding, omitting alternate slots. A 4-pole 40-hp motor was tested with the alternate slot connection. The individual field harmonics of each winding arrangement were obtained by Fourier series analysis, and an equivalent circuit for the entire winding was developed by connecting the circuits for the individual harmonics in series. The calculated speed-torque curves derived from these equivalent circuits check the test data with satisfactory accuracy."
"An all-electronic directional-comparison carrier relay system having a maximum over-all operating time of 1 cycle has been successfully tested both in the laboratory and by staged tests in the field. In order to obtain operating experience, this equipment was placed in temporary service by the Appalachian Electric Power Company to protect a 43-mile 132-kv transmission line between Roanoke and Lynchburg, VA, USA. Permanent installation is planned on the 330-kv system of the American Gas and Electric Company to protect the line between Muskingum and East Lima. This equipment is the result of several years' intensive study and tests to determine the best system of line relaying capable of operating under all conditions in 1 cycle. The expansion in system capacity and the trend to higher line loadings makes it desirable to provide protective relaying equipment which will materially reduce the fringe times of 3 to 4 cycles sometimes - encountered with carrier relaying presently available. Planning studies for higher voltage systems, such as the American Gas and Electric Company 330-kv system, indicated that this development should be completed in time to have such equipment available for these systems. While electronic relays have been used in limited applications in the past, the decision to develop an electronic system for line protection was made only after sufficient study and experience provided assurance that the degree of reliability required for such applications could be obtained. In this paper and three companion papers will be presented system considerations leading to the requirement for maximum relay times of 1 cycle, the reasons for the choice of electronic methods to obtain this performance, detailed description of the equipment, the circuitry, and the results of laboratory and field tests."
"The all-electronic carrier-relaying equipment provides ultrahigh-speed directional- comparison carrier relaying. The inherent limitation of inertia in electromechanical devices is eliminated by complete electronic substitution in fault detecting and directional discriminating functions, as well as in auxiliary functions for control of carrier and circuit-breaker tripping. Other auxiliary functions, where the required speed is well within the range of mechanical devices, are performed by telephone-type auxiliaries. The application of electronics to the field of protective relays has a wide horizon. It is practicable to design circuits which will perform the measurements and make the decisions which have been the tasks of electromechanical devices in the past. Just as electronic computers make more efficient use of valuable calculating time, so electronic relays speed up the operations necessary in maintaining system stability in modern high-voltage transmission systems."
"Since August 1952, high-voltage surge studies have been in progress at the 500-kv test project sponsored by the American Gas and Electric Company. The 500-kv test project is located adjacent to the Tidd power plant near Brilliant, Ohio. The surge studies were conducted as a co-operative program between the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the American Gas and Electric Service Corporation. Westinghouse supplied the surge generator and all necessary measuring equipment; American Gas and Electric erected the high-voltage bus, surge generator, and control building, in addition to making the transmission lines available for the tests. The surge studies were divided into two principal sections: line attenuation and substation characteristics. Companion papers discuss each of these groups. The purpose of this paper is to describe the surge generating and measuring equipment used, and the techniques involved."
"Impulse tests were performed on the experimental transmission lines of the American Gas and Electric Company. When these tests were being planned, it was necessary to select voltage dividers capable of reducing the high surge voltages to a level suitable for measurement by a cathode-ray oscillograph. Selecting dividers for measuring transmission line surges is complicated by the necessity of obtaining a high divider impedance to prevent excessive reflections on the line while maintaining an acceptable divider response. An investigation was undertaken to determine the suitability of the resistance- type divider for this application. Particular attention was given to the sources of error which influence divider response and to methods of overcoming principal errors for physically long, highresistance dividers."
"A graphical method is given for obtaining the speed-torque curves of a squirrel-cage induction motor during d-c dynamic braking. Equations are developed for speed and torque for the region of the magnetization curve which may be considered linear. Experimental verification of the method is shown."
"Two cases of 138-kv H-frame line failures, one during a wind and ice storm, and one during a tornado, gave rise to an investigation and a series of tests of pole foundations and structures. The inadequacy of native soil backfill before reconsolidation during the early life of a line, especially in wet soil, was demonstrated. It was shown that a partial backfill of crushed-stone aggregate, properly proportioned with respect to fine, intermediate, and coarse particle sizes, would provide adequate foundation strength immediately after installation, at moderate cost. Such a foundation was found to be adequate to develop the full strength of an X-braced H-frame structure, with small deflection and uplift movement. Data are given on loadings, developed strengths, and deflections of structures for various foundation conditions. Tests were made in rock setting with different depths, and with both crushed-stone aggregate and weak concrete backfill. These showed that with a depth in rock two thirds of that normally used, either method of backfill develops adequate strength for H-frame structures, with substantial economy. Fiber strengths were calculated from data obtained from the poles broken during the tests. The developed fiber strengths average below American Standards Association (ASA) ratings."
"The laws of electromagnetic energy flow, through space and over wires, and of energy storage in magnetic and electric fields, are applied to an induction machine. This leads to a visualization of the machine as an array of magnetized air spaces in which intense and turbulent energy concentrations exist. The copper and iron structures of the machine that are apparent to the eye and to the touch are thus seen to be of secondary importance. Just as in a turbine the important thing is the flow of energy-containing gas or \"fluid\" through guided paths, so in an electric machine the important thing is the flow of energy through magnetized air spaces. A proper model of the machine therefore would be one formed by first immersing an induction motor in a plastic compound, and then dissolving out all the metal parts with acid, leaving a structure representing only the air and dielectric spaces. These concepts are useful in deriving equations for locking and synchronous crawling torques, and also for the magnetic noise-producing forces in induction machines."
"A 330-kv 1,300-kv BIL air switch has been developed which has been thoroughly tested for radio influence, corona, 60-cycle flashover, impulse flashover, switch gap co-ordination at 1,425 kv basic impulse insulation level (BIL), current capacity, and mechanical ability. Data obtained in this development also proves out the design of a switch using stacks eight insulators high, 1,425 kv BIL. A 330-kv interrupter has been developed capable of interrupting currents, both leading and lagging at very small power factors, of at least 10 amperes."
"There are two facts about single-phase induction motors which have not been generally recognized. 1. The magnitude of the flux in the quadrature axis at the instant the main flux is zero diminishes as the speed is increased above synchronism. 2. The rotor current resulting from the rotor voltage due to the backward-rotating flux component provides the magneto-motive force for the positive flux in the quadrature axis. The purpose of this paper is to promote clear concepts somewhat beyond those normally encompassed by the cross-field theory,1 the rotating-field theory,2 or the equivalent circuit theory of the single-phase induction motor, extending to speeds above synchronism."
"The rapidly increasing demand for circuit breakers with extremely high interrupting capacities has resulted in the development of a 10,000-megavolt-ampere (mva) 138-kv 3-cycle oil circuit breaker. Recent system growth and economic considerations have dictated the expanding utilization of switching equipment with this high short-circuit interrupting capacity which until 1953 was not recognized in the standards of the industry. Furthermore, the trend continues upward and breakers of even higher capacity are currently in the process of being manufactured. The 10,000-mva short-circuit interrupting requirement has extended from the original 230-kv application at the Grand Coulee Dam, but is still confined to the higher transmission voltages. Oil circuit breakers which fulfill this need at both 230 and 161 kv have already been described. 1·2 This paper presents a new oil circuit breaker answering this extreme interrupting requirement at 138 kv, and having a continuous current rating of 1,600 amperes."
"Gas turbines are finding an increasing number of applications as prime movers for electrical power generating units. When combustion gas turbines are started, they are usually accelerated to approximately 20 to 25 per cent of rated speed before the combustor is fired. Further assistance during starting is usually required until the speed reaches 40 to 60 per cent of the rated value. Major components of gas-turbine-generator units may be arranged in a number of configurations. An investigation of possible types of starting devices indicates that a satisfactory arrangement consists of a 4-pole wound rotor induction motor connected to the unit at a suitable location through gearing and a disconnecting clutch. It is important that the auxiliary power supply used with induction motor starting be capable of maintaining rated voltage at the terminals of the motor."
"Recently, considerable interest has been expressed in the interpretation of American Standards and in the relative severity of the interruption of symmetrical currents and of asymmetrical currents having different degrees of asymmetry. To bring out discussions of these problems, the AIEE Committee on Switchgear arranged a session of the AIEE Winter Meeting in New York in 1952, at which session five technical papers on this subject were presented. In view both of the general interest shown at this session and the general trend towards symmetrical ratings for all apparatus, the AIEE Committee on Switchgear directed the AIEE Subcommittee on Power Circuit Breakers to investigate the methods of rating power circuit breakers and to recommend an improved method. A Working Group on Methods of Rating was formed early in 1952 to work out a basis for the change, and the task assigned to the Working Group was: 1. To recommend a new basis for rating; 2. To list the advantages of the new method of rating as compared with the old method; 3. To propose the changes in the ASA Standards that will be necessary; 4. To recommend what provisions must be made in the ASA Standards or otherwise, so that confusion does not arise over existing name-plate ratings. The Working Group was also instructed that it should be cognizant of the work of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), so that, if adopted, a new standard would be a step in the direction of, or compatible with, the International Standards for alternating current circuit breakers. The Working Group has spent considerable time and effort on this assignment, and this paper constitutes its first official report and recommendation for a new basis of rating. It is hoped that this paper will be widely studied and discussed, so that the Working Group can incorporate as many improvements as possible before submitting its final report to the AIEE Subcommittee on Power Circuit Breakers."
"Previous tests and experience have shown that the reliability of isolatedphase busses was not reduced in changing the insulator loading from compression only to compression-tension. Mathematical studies and laboratory tests of the shielding effect of the enclosure1 show that the reduction in force on the insulators is of considerable magnitude. This makes the use of the cantilever loaded insulators a very practical solution to the problem of reducing the number of insulators in the bus. Tests have shown that the isolated phase bus with cantileverloaded insulators will withstand the maximum momentary currents now available with ample factors of safety. An isolated-phase bus was tested up to 350,000 amperes, rms, with insulators spaced 8 feet apart. Even at this high value of current the load on the insulators was 26 per cent under the actual breaking load of the insulator assembly as determined by test. The load on the insulator was less than 15 per cent of the load which would have appeared if the enclosures were not present. At 200,000 amperes, the insulator was loaded to only 77 per cent of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) rating. This is powerful proof of the shielding effect of the isolated-phase enclosures, and that the cantilever insulator is more than adequate to meet present and future momentary requirements."
"When an underground cable line is installed in an area where the soil is a poor conductor of heat, it is necessary to take corrective measures so that the heat generated in the cable may be dissipated without overheating the cable. The most practical approach is to replace the soil in the immediate vicinity of the cable with a substitute soil of good thermal conductivity. Methods of mathematical analysis described in the literature in recent years may be utilized to determine what amount of soil must be replaced in this fashion. The replacement soil, of course, must be suitable economically as well as thermally. Tests have been conducted which show that silicic sands having a grain-size distribution which results in sufficiently high solids content are quite suitable for this purpose."
"As a result of increasing numbers of reports from operating companies concerning the adverse effects of ice storms and in recognition of the need for some kind of procedure to permit artificial reproduction of ice storm conditions so as to accomplish laboratory testing of high-voltage switchgear, a number of manufacturers devoted engineering time and equipment to research on this subject. One end result was the recent literature on the design and ice testing of high-voltage outdoor disconnecting switches. This included suggested specifications for ice testing, and stimulated a broad interest in the subject, focusing attention upon the need for an ice testing guide that could be followed by all interested parties for the purpose of obtaining reasonably reproducible conditions for testing the performance of equipment. A direct result was the appointment of a Working Group of the AIEE Subcommittee on Switches, Fuses and Insulators. This Working Group was charged with the responsibility of studying the subject and preparing a guide for the ice testing of disconnecting switches."
"The problem of the relative importance of direct and indirect lightning surges on high-voltage distribution lines has not previously been solved quantitatively. From existing knowledge of the lightning discharge, the wave shapes and amplitudes of electrostatically induced surges on an overhead conductor are derived. These are found to vary with the amplitude of the inducing lightning current, with the distance between the lightning stroke and the line, with the type of object struck and with the construction of the line involved. Frequency distribution curves are established of the amplitudes both of indirect and direct lightning surges on typical 11-kv distribution lines. The probable numbers of flashovers are evaluated for different types of line construction, for different insulation levels, and for lines surrounded by open ground as compared with lines surrounded by buildings or trees. The corresponding numbers of surges produced on these lines without causing flashover of the line insulation are also determined. The theoretical results obtained are found to be in good agreement with such field observations as are available for comparison."
"Technological advances and closely engineered practices have kept the cost of high-voltage transmission from rising in a period of inflation. By applying the experiences that have contributed to this economy into the higher voltages, design is under way to transmit large blocks of power at 345 kv on the Bonneville Power Administration system in the Pacific Northwest. Practices that have made this possible include revised concepts of protection from abnormal voltages, always an item of high cost, and one which warrants continued study."
"Inner cooling of rotor and stator windings makes it possible to obtain a substantial increase in the ratings of turbine generators. Improvements in associated components such as ventilation arrangements, blowers, coolers, and seals permit a compact and efficient construction."
"To prevent excessive magnetic vibrations in a-c generators, it is necessary to provide an adequate core mounting and to avoid resonance in the associated parts. When the frames are too complex to permit accurate analysis, the use of scale models proves valuable in obtaining the dynamic characteristics. On large machines, which cannot be tested in the manufacturer's plants, simple analyses and tests may be used advantageously for determining the correction of any problem that may arise in service."
"The designer of electric machinery is continually challenged to obtain greater output from each pound of material. He is also challenged to further the search for successful design solutions to unsolved problems of long standing. Recent developments in armature winding design for turbine generators have made possible substantial progress in these directions. Two new classes of generators have been developed which make machines of a given rating physically smaller and which greatly extend the possible ratings of the largest machine. The first class, which this paper proposes to cover, increases the capability of the stator without altering cooling methods. This is accomplished by new electric arrangements of the armature windings. The second class, which will be discussed here briefly for comparison, deals with a stator design with improved means of heat removal. New methods of field winding ventilation have also been developed which make possible rotors which match the increased capability of the stator. Progress in this direction is discussed in a companion paper.1 In the design of double-winding generators, many restrictions of long standing have been removed by the development of new armature winding arrangements."
"Varnished cambric tape has been used as electric insulation very extensively in the past because of its high dielectric strength, stretchability to fit irregular surfaces, and relatively high resistance to humidity. However, this material is relatively expensive, and seriously contaminates the Askarels. Two new high-density crepe papers have now been developed to replace the varnished cambric. For the same thickness and width, the tear strength of one of these new crepe papers is equal to that of the varnished cambric, while its lengthwise tensile strength is almost three times as high. The dielectric strength of this crepe paper at both 60 cycles and impulse tests compares very favorably with the varnished cambric. The second of these new crepe papers is characterized with 2-way stretch and is suitable for producing cables with great flexibility. The electrical, physical, and chemical characteristics of this new paper are also comparable to those of varnished cambric. Cables insulated with this new crepe paper can be advantageously used for both oil and Askarel transformers."
"A method of calculation of the eddy-current loss in solid copper induction motor end-turn clamping rings is presented. Theoretical calculations and test results are given for a 2-pole 60-cycle motor, and are shown to be in close agreement."
"The present sound level index of transformer noise is discussed and compared with two of several other indexes considered by the Committee. These are loudness level and audibility. It is believed that the index of loudness level is more indicative of disturbance from transformer noise than is sound level. However, measurement of loudness level is more complex since it requires some form of frequency analysis and more or less extensive calculation. Furthermore, loudness level does not decrease following the law of spherical divergence even though the attenuation of the individual frequencies may follow this law. Therefore the loudness level has to be calculated for each distance of interest. The audibility index depends on the intensity of the individual frequency components above ambient noise. Data are presented which indicate when the intensity of the individual components will be great enough to make them audible. Determination of audibility is most precise when based on measurements involving frequency analysis. However, the limited data now available point to the possibility of using only the sound level meter with its A weighting network for this method. Measurements made with the sound level meter can be used to determine the distance betwen transformer and residence necessary for just achieving inaudibility. However, it is not to be inferred that inaudibility is necessary for satisfactory installation. Experience curves are presented which indicate that the level may be raised above inaudibility without giving rise to significant reaction."
"Losses associated with sale power are determined from a family of charts, constructed as described in the paper. The losses are given as a function of total system load, power over the interconnections, and amount of sale power from each generating station. The simplifying approximations used are: 1. Reduction of the transmission system to a simplified equivalent without internal loops. 2. Current equal to power in per cent of base. 3. Fixed distribution through the tie lines of sale power from a given generating station. 4. Fixed dispatch of system load. These approximations may be modified. The method has been in use by Commonwealth Associates, Inc., for a number of years and is applicable to systems where these approximations are valid. The advantages of the in-phase method are: 1. The simplicity and directness with which incremental losses associated with sale power can be determined. 2. The flexibility in determining losses for a wide variety of system load and sale conditions. 3. No computer is required either in the preparation or use of the charts. This paper describes one phase of a joint study of loss evaluation conducted by Commonwealth Associates, Inc., the Consumers Power Company, and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Current- and powerform loss formulas are described in a companion paper.1"
"Shunt capacitors for supplying leading reactive for power factor correction have been used on power systems for a great many years, but it is only recently that large shunt capacitor banks have been extensively applied to power systems at primary transmission voltages. Such applications have given rise to a requirement for satisfactory high-voltage switching equipment at minimum cost. Up until the present the power system engineer has had but little choice of equipment other than the standard commercially available power circuit breakers for his capacitor switching applications. Such circuit breakers were fundamentally designed for the relatively infrequent interruption of system fault currents, they were very often without special design considerations for interruption of capacitive currents, and were so costly as definitely to restrict the economic feasibility of many potential applications. Conversely, a capacitor switch should be designed to function satisfactorily when subjected to a very large number of routine switching operations, possibly several per day, without frequent maintenance periods; it may be designed with relatively low fault-interrupting capacity, as fault protection is usually obtained by individual capacitor fuses and station bus differential; and it should be designed for minimum cost to extend the range of economic feasibility of shunt capacitor installations at transmission voltages. Field tests on a prototype of such a switch have now been successfully performed and are outlined in this article."
"On pages 159 and 160 of the April 1953 issue of Power Apparatus and Systems, there is a discussion by C.G. Veinott of the paper entitled \"Speed-Torque Calculations for Induction Motors with Part Windings\" by P.L. Alger, Y.H. Ku, and C.N.T. Pan. Reference is made there to micromicrofarad μμf) waves. This should have been magnetomotive force (mmf) waves."
"By using an accurate machine and specially shaped brushes, a method has been developed to analyze the resistance of carbon to copper sliding contacts. It is found that the conducting areas on the copper ring are long narrow strips. Although they act in somewhat different ways, the current density in the conducting areas is a constant of the order of 2X105 amperes per centimeter (cm)2 for both anode and cathode brushes. The brush rides on a film of water which is dispersed when the ring stops, or at high current, or in dry air. This film causes an increase in voltage on starting which is remarkably independent of the operating conditions and this increase has a value of about 0.35 volt. Not much higher voltage is required for the electrical breakdown (fritting) of the thin oxide film around the conducting spots. This leads to a theory that the size of the conducting spots is determined by an equilibrium between oxidation of the copper and fritting or breakdown of the oxide layer, which is then substantiated by some further experiments. In brief, it is found that the mechanism of conduction in sliding contacts can be explained by well-known physical effects. These include constriction resistance, water film, tunnel effect, oxidation, and film breakdown."
"Additional background information made available in the last 5 years now permits the approximate time-current characteristics of fault currents in d-c systems to be calculated with the assurance of more realistic results. The need for this information has increased as the concentrations of d-c power sources have grown. Some older systems may also benefit from a short-circuit study. The object of this work is to assemble information and methods which will permit the reader readily to determine fault characteristics of d-c systems. This paper is limited to a discussion of d-c systems containing only motors and generators. The information presently available regarding the fault characteristics of other sources of short-circuit current is not sufficiently advanced to permit its inclusion in this paper. The other sources of short-circuit current are rectifiers, synchronous converters, electrolytic cells, and batteries, and it is expected that as further information concerning the fault characteristics of these sources becomes available, it will also be simplified and presented in a readily usable form."
"Presents the front cover/table of contents for this issue of the periodical."
"The purpose of this paper is to analyze a number of the basic design and application requirements of main-field circuit breakers forsynchronous machines. The general functions and requirements of main-field circuit breakers are described with typical circuit diagrams. Transient voltages and currents in the excitation circuit are analyzed under normal switching and fault conditions. A basis is suggested for selecting a value of discharge resistance which will bring about the maximum limitation of armature fault damage without creating undue risk of damage to insulation components of the excitation circuit. Equivalent circuits are developed for testing the interrupting performance of the breakers. Suggested constants for interrupting-test circuits are tabulated, as well as values for momentary, short-time, and high-potential tests, over the range of main-field currents and voltages which is anticipated. Interrupting performance tests and a view of a new field breaker for a 250-volt 1,600-ampere circuit are given."
"The important result in many studies of transient response is the maximum displacement experienced by one or more parts of the system. It is possible to calculate this maximum value directly from the system response function, without inspecting a complete plot of the response. The usefulness of the proposed calculation can be illustrated by applying it to the determination of maximum shaft torques in a 3-unit turbine-generator set following a short circuit."
"Slot effects in machines are analyzed using digital computations by means of punched-card techniques. Analysis methods are developed for ascertaining these effects in terms of large numbers of different machines so that optimum design combinations may be found. A general solution is indicated and a more practical solution using a simplifying assumption is developed in detail for use with punched-card computers. For qualitative results a still more approximate method is given in the Appendix."
"In evaluating surge protection applications it is necessary to consider surge voltages of many shapes, and evaluate their effect on the insulation of electric equipment. Since insulation performance is normally expressed in terms of certain standard waves, the desired method should give a means of comparison between wave shapes. The integration method, originally presented by Witzke and Bliss,1,2 provides such a means. The purpose of this paper is to present laboratory data to evaluate the accuracy of the integration method. It is concluded that the method provides a satisfactory technique for applying surge protection on a scientific basis."
"In October 1952 a motor test program was started at Dow Corning Corporation to evaluate a series of new modified silicone magnet-wire enamels. The purpose of this program is to determine by functional test methods the thermal life of these new enamels. Twelve 7½-horsepower induction motors insulated with silicone components and wound with wire enameled with Dow Corning 1360 wire enamel have been tested. In addition, five similar motors insulated with class-A materials have been tested to obtain data indicating the relative life-temperature characteristics of the class-A system for comparison with the silicone system. The data indicate that motors insulated with silicone components and wound with wire enameled with Dow Corning magnet-wire enamel can be operated at an average copper temperature in the range of 160 to 180 C with a life comparable to class-A insulated motors operated within their temperature limits."
"A new method of suppressing radio interference caused by high-voltage power lines has been investigated in Sweden. It consists of transmitting the radio program directly from the disturbing power line, which thus acts as a transmitting antenna. To feed a line 100 miles long a transmitter with an output of about 50 watts and a frequency between 150 and 200 kc per second is required. In this paper the electrical details of the line radio are described and particulars are given of the results obtained from measuring the signal and interference voltages. The experiments were carried out jointly by the Swedish State Power Board and the Royal Swedish Board of Telecommunications."
"The problem of obtaining maximum hydro energy from the various plants of the Columbia River is one phase of a broader problem that the staff at the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) has designated the economy loading problem, which may be defined in a broad sense as follows: To plan, design, and operate the hydro and electric system so that maximum hydro energy will be delivered economically to the load as required, without undue sacrifice of system reliability during normal or emergency operation. While direct BPA system generation is all hydro, interconnections with other systems having some steam generation will make it necessary to include solutions in which the cost of thermal energy is considered. A number of papers have been presented on economy loading as applied to thermal generation and to system transmission losses. However, up to now relatively little information has been published on obtaining maximum energy from hydro stations. A description of all the phases of the general problem of economy loading will not be attempted in this paper, which will investigate only an individual phase. It should be emphasized, however, that, to obtain correct solutions, all components are interrelated and should be considered simultaneously. Unfortunately, the complexity of such simultaneous solutions may make them impossible to achieve from a practical standpoint."
"When transformers with automatic load ratio control are operated in parallel, a miethod of preventing excessive circulating current is required. Some of the methods used are extremely complex, requiring additional equipment and control connections between units. The combination of resistance compensation to produce constant voltage at the load center as well as reverse reactance compensation to limit the circulating current between units is applicable to many circuits where more complicated means of parallel operation are now used. This system has the advantage of requiring no additional equipment and no control connections between units. The relations developed show that satisfactory performance in limiting circulating current between units and maintaining voltage can be secured in many cases. The best performance is obtained when the power factor of the circuit is high and substantially constant, and when the power factor of the circulating current is low. However, variations in load power at light loads have little effect on the performance. Equations for calculating the performance of this control on paralleled circuits are derived."
"A method is presented for predetermining the economic dispatch of a steam-electric generating system including consideration of transmission losses. The equations of economic dispatch are solved for a range of values of delivered power cost to develop the dispatch curves. Novel features include an iterative method of solution which simplifies and shortens the work, and an interpretive study which shows how the single set of dispatch curves may be used to determine the economic dispatch with units out, and to determine the sale power cost at interconnections, and how it may be used for other similar extensions. The complete method for determination of the loss formula to determination and interpretation of the economic-dispatch curves is described using the Ohio Edison system as an example. The feasibility of holding tie power fixed at average values while determining the economic dispatch of generation is demonstrated for this system. The problem of selecting a proper reactive to real power ratio at generating stations is discussed and a solution proposed. This is part of a joint study1,2; which has been participated in by Commonwealth Associates, Inc., Consumers Power Company, Ohio Edison Company, Pennsylvania Power Company, and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation."
"In recent years the use of high-pressure pipe-type cable circuits for high-voltage underground power transmission has increased so rapidly that this has now become the most important means of bulk power transmission in locations where over-head lines are not permitted. Other papers have explored the electrical characteristics, current-carrying capabilities, installation methods, and similar considerations. Little has been published with regard to the pipe which is at once a structure, a pressure vessel, and the cable sheath. This paper is concerned only with the pipe. It deals with the selection of suitable pipe for high-pressure feeders, the preparation of pipe ends for welding, methods of welding, and weld testing. The need for anchoring pipes at terminal ends is discussed, as well as the question of protecting the pipes against corrosion."
"High-voltage integration has proceeded in Britain in two well-defined stages, the first about 1930 with the establishment of a 132-kv national grid, and the second now in progress with the construction of a 275/300-kv supergrid. Each stage of development has been associated with important statutory changes. This paper deals broadly with the main problems encountered at each stage, the general principles adopted, and the effect on system planning. The economic basis of the 275/300-kv scheme is discussed with some indication of its implications for the future pattern of electricity supply in Britain."
"This paper describes the use of a high-speed digital computer for the purpose of searching for economical modes of operation in a mathematical model of a hydrothermal electric system. The minimization of annual operating cost is treated as a problem in the calculus of variations. A gradient concept is employed to successively seek time schedules of water use which reduce annual operating costs. Such reductions are achieved partly by increasing the energy yield, partly by sacrificing energy yield at one time to reduce high operating costs at another time, and partly by reducing the violation of prescribed rules of operation."
"An electronic distance relay is described which uses a principle whereby the phase angle of voltage components is compared. A relay time of 1 cycle or less has been realized on tests of a laboratory model. The relay has the feature of simplicity, since only one tube and two diode rectifiers are used per phase."
"Simultaneous faults on power systems are not common but they do occur. The dynamic overvoltages on the unfaulted phases at one fault point can be increased by the presence of a second fault on a system. Simple equations are derived for the voltages at the fault points and for the currents flowing into the faults. A general set of curves is impracticable because of the number of variables that must be considered."
"Preheating of the field windings of large turbine generators is a procedure for warming up and expanding the coils somewhat during the start-up operation by heating them with direct current while the machine is at a relatively low speed. This is done to reduce the mechanical stresses in the coils and the abrasion effects on the coil insulation resulting from thermal expansion. This paper presents an analysis of the various forces which act on the coils in normal service, including a shortening effect in the cylindrical field body caused by the rotational stresses. It proceeds then to show how the coil stresses and insulation abrasion can be reduced by preheating. The procedure recommended is based on the transient heating characteristics of the rotor and requires a relatively short period of time which can normally be co-ordinated with practical turbine starting cycles. With suitable equipment, preheating can be carried out quite easily and gives promise of prolonging the useful life of generator field windings. This paper is concerned only with fields employing conventional ventilation as used for many years. In the future, preheating may well be applied to fields employing direct cooling, at least, in cases where this improved cooling is capitalized to the point where the temperature rise of the winding is comparable with present practice. However, the preheating cycle for directly cooled fields will probably require some modification on account of the more rapid heating of the winding."
"When an impulse wave hits a transformer winding, transient voltages are produced in all the windings. This paper discusses the voltages transferred to the terminals of the nonimpulsed windings of 3-winding transformers and autotransformers. Only two components of the transferred surge have practical significance: the electrostatic component and the electromagnetic component. Analytical expressions of the terminal voltages have been obtained for both these components for various terminal conditions of the nonimpulsed windings. Comparisons are made with tests made on an electromagnetic model of a 33,333-kva 3-winding transformer. Recommendations are made for the protection of the tertiary windings of transformers and of the apparatus connected to these windings."
"When a steep-front surge impinges upon a transformer winding, an electrostatic voltage distribution is immediately established along all the transformer windings. This paper discusses this electrostatic distribution in the impulsed and in the two nonimpulsed windings of 3-winding transformers, and expressions of the electrostatic voltages are derived analytically for various terminal conditions of the nonimpulsed windings. The line terminals of these windings may be isolated, grounded directly, or grounded through a capacitor. Computed voltages are in good agreement with the initial voltages measured on a 667-kva single-phase transformer and on its electromagnetic model, and also with the voltages measured on a capacitance board representing only the electrostatic field of the transformer."
"This paper describes the development of a circuit breaker for the high interrupting duty required on many 69-kv metropolitan systems. Recognition of the peculiar problems of such systems resulted in the development of an oil circuit breaker for an interrupting duty of 3,500 megavolt amperes (mva). The results of complete laboratory tests give proof of mechanical and electrical performance with adequate margin. The breaker is mounted on a unit base enabling it to be shipped completely assembled with all adjustments made at the factory. The breaker has successfully interrupted currents equivalent to 5,000 mva, and these tests indicate that the breaker with a minimum of additional development work will be suitable for interrupting ratings of 5,000 mva when they are required. The standard interrupter recognizes some cable-switching applications at this voltage, interrupting up to 150 amperes of capacitance load without producing serious overvoltage. The standard interrupter may be modified for switching higher capacitance loads up to 240 amperes."
"An adjustable-speed drive using a d-c series generator supplying a d-c series motor is described. This drive operates well at speeds under 10 rpm as well as at speeds limited only by mechanical considerations. The ratio of maximum to minimum speed, Fig. 4, is in the order of 100 to 1. The drive has the high starting-torque characteristic of the series motor, and it requires no elaborate control equipment. The speed is essentially constant between no load and full load for each setting of a control-field rheostat."
"This paper shows how mathematical systems of straight lines or simple curves may be developed to represent the performance of the ordinary d-c motor. The study deals with the shunt and the series motor. Because of the association of the engineer in his early college study with simple mathematical curves such as the straight line and hyperbola, the developed motor equation will enable him to use such curves as references in his thinking when applying a motor to a particular situation."
"Methods are presented for determining the transient stability of systems of synchronous and induction machines. Treatment of the induction machine by its inertia and a voltage back of transient reactance makes possible its representation in stability studies by an a-c network calculator or digital computer. A digital-computer method for transient-stability studies is outlined, based on representation of the connecting power network by its admittance constants. Synchronous and induction machines are treated as in the a-c network calculator studies. The method is illustrated and its accuracy verified by application to a simple system having two synchronous machines, two induction motors, three fault busses, and two shunt loads. A complete derivation of the admittance method is included in the paper as well as accuracy criteria for the admittance constants."
"This paper presents a new theorem for equalizer of d-c machinery and a simple method of estimating its required size, for d-c lap windings under some assumed type of unbalance, by an equation derived from the conventional revolving field theory of polyphase induction motors. It is shown that only a very small conductor section will be sufficient for ordinary anticipated type of unbalance. In reaching the equation, power limits of various types of d-c armature windings as a consequence of the permissible voltage between adjacent commutator bars are discussed."
"Since World War II serious plant shortage in Britain has necessitated load shedding during the winter peak periods. Load reductions were effected by reducing frequency and voltage and on occasions by disconnecting some supplies. This report summarizes the experience of operation at low frequency in Britain and indicates its effect on demand."
"To make correct line-drop compensator settings on single-phase regulators connected open delta on a 3-phase 3-wire system, it is necessary to identify the units, commonly called leading or lagging units, in which the regulator current has been advanced or retarded by the open-delta connection. This paper describes a field method for making this identification, using only the standard regulator controls without the knowledge of phase identity or sequence and also without additional measuring or phasing equipment. The discussion includes mathematical analysis, curves, sample calculations, and laboratory analysis used in developing this method."

"This paper describes a laboratory model AM broadcast receiver which used nine alloy junction transistors and two compensating diodes. Six of the transistors were of the laboratory P-N-P type, designed for radio-frequency-amplifiers, and three of the transistors were of the conventional P-N-P type selected for Class B audio driver and output service. The use of Class B output permitted a total battery drain below 12 milliamperes from six 1.5 volt type C cells in series. The battery life was aproximately 500 hours, and the battery cost relatively small. The maximum audio power output was 150 milliwatts into a four-inch by six-inch oval speaker. The sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio were comparable to that of conventional battery-operated receivers and conventional ac-dc receivers. The receiver may be used in the place of ac-dc receivers without the necessity of a power outlet or a connecting power cord at a battery cost approximately the same as the cost of power for an ac-dc receiver."
"Some essential properties of amplifiers for operation in the UHF television band are discussed with particular reference to stability, gain, and noise factor. Various types of tubes have been evaluated, including the Western Electric 416A and 417A; RCA pencil triode; General Electric 6AJ4 and 6AM4; Sylvania 6AN4, and other tubes of special construction."
"A disc-seal planar triode and its performance as a UHF amplifier are discussed. The description of mechanical features is followed by calculations of available power gain, and the measured gain is shown to be close to that computed by theory. The noise figure is calculated by conventional means, but the measured value is found to be higher. Reasons for the discrepancy are pointed out. The four pole admittances, yij, and their influence on practical circuit design, are discussed."
"Summary form only given, as follows. Larger kinescopes and the advent of compatible color television have given increased importance to the problem of improving the transient response of television receivers. This paper is concerned with receiver design factors that make for improved electrical fidelity, although the interlocking nature of the transmitter and receiver requires some consideration of the transmitter aspects of the problem. In the receiver, the electrical fidelity is primarily determined by the delay distortion produced in the video i-f amplifier, and the extent to which this distortion is compensated in the peaking circuits of the video detector and the video amplifier. Optimum results are obtained by working with both the phase-delay characteristic of the over-all receiver and the corresponding amplitude characteristic. In color receivers, prevention of delay distortion has been found to be of primary importance, as might be expected fro-m the fact that the channel is being used to greater capacity. The factors which determine crosstalk between the I and Q color-difference signals and coincidence of the luminance and chrominance information are described. Ultimately, obtaining a uniformly high standard of receiver transient response depends upon industry agreement on a standard monitor. Widespread use of such a monitor should go far toward eliminating the present tendency for receiver designs to vary their designs to meet the peculiarities of a particular transmitter."
"The paper deals with a method for synchronous detection employing half-wave rectifiers, rather than product demodulators, for the decoding of NTSC color signals. Two basic circuits are presented illustrating the balanced and unbalanced envelope detector and using conventional diodes and triodes, respectively. The ultimate phase accuracy is found to be ± 2 degrees for the unbalanced type, and better than ± 1 degree for the balanced type. However, these errors occur only at specific angles and vanish on others."
"A beam deflection tube is described which appears to be capable of economically performing some of the decoder operations in an NTSC color television receiver. Several circuit applications are reviewed and experimental results obtained on a receiver used in NTSC field tests are presented."
"In the course of color television field tests, it has been found that receivers need about 50 db of sound attenuation in the i-f channel in order to prevent beat between the sound carrier and the color carrier components from appearing in the receiver. It was of some interest to determine whether this high requirement was justified in an ideal receiver or was only the result of defects in a practical receiver. A study of this indicated that this much sound rejection is generally required in an ideal receiver having the standard selectivity curve. The calculated value of attenuation is 44db, which, because of transmission vagaries and other variations, points to the use of at least a 50 db sound trap."
"Summary form only given. The DC Quadricorrelator is a new form of automatic-phase-control circuit -which, when applied to color synchronization, gives better performance and appears easier to manufacture than circuits previously used. It provides automatic color synchronization without need for a manually-operated frequency or phase control. The circuit combines good noise immunity with rapid pull-in. Its performance and relative simplicity indicate a possible net reduction in overall receiver cost. The circuit also provides reliable, noise-immune automatic switching of receiver circuits for monochrome or color operation. The principle of operation of the \"Quadri\" is the fact that it supplements the APC loop with an additional detector operating in quadrature with the phase detector of the APC loop. This added detector develops an auxiliary dc control voltage only when the system is in synchronism. The presence or absence of this do voltage distinguishes between the in-sync and not-in-sync modes of operation. This voltage acts as a control signal which- switches a circuit parameter so that the APC loop has the necessary properties for good pull-in when it is not in synchronism and the necessary properties for good dynamic stability when it is in synchronism."

"Tuner design concepts for uhf grounded grid amplifiers using the new 6BA4 rocket tube are discussed. The four terminal admittances are used as the basis for these concepts. A brief review of noise and gain considerations of a uhf amplifler tube is included. A number of types of circuit parameters such as lumped constants, and coaxial lines are given consideration as applied to input and output uhf amplifiers. Both boosters and tuners are included in the circuit discussion, and noise figure, gain and bandwidth data on experimental models is compared to theory."
"The designer of IF amplifiers for color television receivers is confronted with the problems inherent in black-and-white amplifiers, plus new problems introduced by the addition of the chrominance subcarrier and its sidebands. This paper evaluates these problems as they affect the design of the IF amplifier. The principal problem is that of providing adequate rejection at 41.25 mc without introducing excessive delay in the color sideband region which is separated from the sound carrier by less than 1 per cent of the signal frequency. Novel non-minimum phase shift trap circuits are described which provide the required attenuation with low delay distortion."
"Astigmatism, the principal deflection yoke aberration, sets a fundamental limit on the performance of cathode ray tube displays and is possessed by all yokes in varying type and degree. This paper analyzes the structure of an astigmatic beam with a view to measuring its properties objectively. Optical concepts are useful in describing the beam distortions encountered and two methods of achieving a numerical rating are outlined. Microscope measurements of the variation of spot shape along the beam path yield quantitative data regarding the primary and secondary foci. This data provides a basis for isolating the ``optical'' characteristics of deflection yokes. Methods of classifying and evaluating astigmatic errors in both monochrome and color displays are discussed."
"At present there are three major uses for semiconductor diodes in the television receivers of today. Both silicon and germanium diodes have proven themselves indispensable in TV applications as uhf mixers, harmonic generators and video detectors."
"The presence of voltage surges in series heater strings represents a major source of tube failures. Tubes supplied by various tube manufacturers behave differently in the heater string. A method of tube evaluation outside the heater string enables prediction of surge conditions in the string. Surge-free operation can be readily obtained by tube selection. This selection does not provide for trouble-free operation in the event of field tube replacement. It is necessary to establish industry standardization of heater characteristics to eliminate all trouble."
"The concept and the measurement of the Beat Size Effect in television are discussed. It is shown that as a result of this effect, a monochrome signal may tolerate interference 25 to 30 db stronger when the interference falls in the upper part of the channel as compared to the level which may be tolerated near the picture carrier. NTSC color television does not enjoy this advantage."

"The Western Electric Company has proposed a Cumulative Results Sampling Plan to supplement plans using zero acceptance numbers. The proposed plan makes use of the cumulative results of a number of previous inspection lots to determine the disposition of a subsequent lot when a sampling plan with zero acceptance number is used and only one (1) defect is found in the sample. The proposed plan has the effect of decreasing the producer's risk in the area of relatively good quality while increasing the consumer's risk only slightly at Pa (.50) over that obtained by the MIL-STD plan with zero acceptance number. At Pa (.1) the CC curve for the plan practically coincides with the corresponding MIL-STD plan with zero acceptance number. The use of the proposed plan should overcome much of the reluctance of suppliers to the application of statistical sampling to product that is submitted in small lots and may, in some instances, permit the use of sampling when 100% inspection was heretofore necessary. It is recommended that consideration be given to the general use of Cumulative Results Sampling Plans where the continued use of sampling plans with zero acceptance numbers becomes necessary."

"Emphasis on research has resulted in a loss of appreciation of the major engineering effort necessary to convert basic ideas to reliable hardware. The current impression is that research is 95 per cent of the job and that the conversion to hardware occurs in that mysterious process known as ``production''. There is a necessity for re-educating engineers to the challenging task that confronts us in making today's electronic wonders reliable."

"An informational approach is developed to the general problem of organization. It is shown by its use that system engineering design in general can be brought under the same philosophy and body of techniques naw beginning to dominate the field of communication system design.

A brief indication is made of the potentialities of this new approach."

"The control of cost of research and development projects is intimately related to all factors of technical supervision. The methods must be developed to fit the needs of the particular types of research and development programs and of the organization in which the programs are carried out. Some general principles and specific practices in use at one industrial research laboratory may find general usefulness in many organizations. For example, the concept that adequate control of any business or technical problem requires, first, a plan or standard and, finally, a review or measurement to determine conformance to the plan, will be of use for all control problems. The degree of formality with which such a principle is applied requires careful consideration in order that adequate control will be obtained without inhibiting imaginative approaches to problems. This paper discusses particular principles and methods of project planning and review and the relationship of these methods to personnel and to organization. These factors are discussed from the viewpoint of the project leader, the research supervisor and the technical manager. Specific examples are used to illustrate approaches."

"This paper consists of three parts, each treating a single type of antenna scan. Part I is devoted to the spiral scan, deriving the equations of motion for searching a region of space in a minimum period of time. Power relations required for the antenna drive also are derived. Part II discusses a simple conical scan; the development concerns the optimum antenna gain, the gain at the edges of the region scanned, and the optimum wavelength. Part III pertains to sector scanning. The analysis of the variation of target illumination over the sector is presented for an antenna having simple harmonic motion. The critical angles for selection between a sector-scanning antenna and a uniformly rotating assembly of ``n'' antennas are derived. A figure of merit for sector scan having non-harmonic motion is defined."

"A new principle that makes possible nonquantized altitude information so that the accurate range of altimeters can be extended to include low-level operation is described. A frequency shifter is inserted between the local oscillator and the mixer in order to remove the inherent error in conventional altimeters that makes them objectionable for low-altitude operation. The authors show how the characteristic of the amplifier can be shaped diferently and point out that the strength of the return signal and the inherent amplitude modulation determine the most suitable characteristic for any particular operating condition."

The probability of unscheduled removal, derived from the investigation data, was used as a criterion for the assessment of the optimum period between scheduled overhauls. It was found that, in many instances, the probability of failure is greatest immediately after overhaul and decreases with time. Comparisons of the performance of various types of units are given."

"This simulator was designed for use as an aid in the study of the problems of co-ordinating many aircraft in a given geographic area. Correspondingly, the equipment is only as sophisticated as the requirements of the special problem dictated. The main significance of the simulator lies in its ability to develop, with a small operating crew, a complex aircraft traffic situation as might be viewed by a ground based surveillance radar. Further, the simulator is capable of generating signals for use in testing and developing experimental data-processing, computing, and recording equipment. Several methods of simulating simplified aircraft tracks in three dimensions are included. Simulation equipments based on these methods are in use as data sources for track-while-scan radar repeater presentation and for direct use in ground-installed computing and recording equipment. The methods involve both integration and multiplication techniques in generating voltages which represent tracks in rectangular co-ordinates. The voltages may be used directly in computers, or video circuits may be employed to convert aircraft position to polar form for Plan Position Indicator and RHI presentation. The simulation methods vary in the degree of aircraft maneuverability from nonmaneuvering straight-line aircraft to that of fixed-rate-of-turn aircraft. The complete installation has the capacity to simultaneously generate twenty-four aircraft paths."

"THE coating of a sheet of steel with tin is known today as tin plating. Tin plate was first manufactured by the hot-dip process started by the Welsh several hundred years ago. Early attempts were crude and largely manual. A sheet of steel of appropriate thickness and dimension was dipped in a molten bath of tin. Tinning was preceded by suitable fluxing and cleaning so as to produce a bright metallic, homogeneous coating."
"A PROBLEM of frequent occurrence in servomechanism analysis and design is that of determining the gain K of the forward-frequency transfer function $[G(s)]_{s} = j \\omega = \\left [ {K(1+a_{1}s+ \\ldots + a_{m}s^m)} \\over {s^k (1+b_{1}s + \\ldots + b_{n}s^n)}\\right ]s = j \\omega \\eqno{\\hbox{(1)}}$ of a single-loop unity feedback system, Fig. 1, such that the over-all frequency transfer function ${C(j \\omega) \\over R(j \\omega)} = {G(j \\omega) \\over 1+G(j \\omega)} = {\\vert G(j \\omega)\\vert e^{j \\alpha 1} \\over \\vert 1+G(j \\omega) \\vert \\epsilon ^{j \\alpha 2}} = M \\epsilon ^{(j \\alpha 1-\\alpha 2)} = M \\epsilon ^{(j \\alpha)} \\eqno{\\hbox{(2)}}$ has a specified maximum modulus M = Mm. Accordingly, those textbooks1-4 which present a comprehensive integrated accountof basic servo mechanism theory advance the outline of a simple graphical procedure for determining the required gain K, providing Mm > 1."
"THE resistance and reactance of a circuit increases when associated with an iron conduit. In normal circuit operation where the current-carrying conductors are wholly within a conduit, the iron has little effect on the resistance and reactance since the magnetic field locally surrounding the conductors is partly in iron and mostly in air. However, the circuits encountered in building wiring during a phase-to-ground fault condition that involves the conduit in and around the faulted circuit are subject to an appreciable increase in resistance and reactance. The purpose of this paper is to record a relatively simple method of approximating the impedance of such a faulted circuit, to point out the significance of the impedance values as they occur in practice and why these values must be considered by the engineer in design of circuits, particularly under faulted conditions."
"FOR many years, the use of rectifier motive power was considered impracticable for several reasons, one of which involved the telephone interference problem. Corrective measures considered necessary to minimize power supply wave distortion of the single-phase rectifier to a degree which would be satisfactory for telephone communication rendered this type of motive power unacceptable to locomotive builders and to railroads."
"The use of a linear anticipatory switching network in an on-off servomechanism, while improving system stability, does not result in optimum response. Mathematical analysis of second order systems indicates that the network should be a nonlinear function of error and error rate. This paper describes a method for deriving the switching criterion for a “piecewise” linear on-off servo of order greater than two, when the input variable is limited to a step function of position and velocity. The switching criterion results in system error and in derivatives of error reducing to zero in a minimum time. System behavior is described in the principal co-ordinate phase space. Starting at a point in the phase space corresponding to the initial conditions, the representative point moves in a series of discontinuous trajectories determined by the sign of the controlled variable, eventually reaching the origin. The sequence of sign reversals represents the desired switching criterion."
"WHEN two ignitron rectifier freight locomotives (class E2C and E3B) were first put into service on the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) approximately 2 years ago, the event could well have been taken as marking the golden jubilee of main-line electrification in this country. Certainly their successful design and operation are a fitting tribute to those who in 1902 first took a contract to equip a high-speed railroad line with an electrification using single-phase series-type railway motors."
"THE USE of electric equipment in a Diesel propulsion system for ship drive serves as a nonmechanical means of connecting one or more relatively high-speed engines to an inherently slow-speed propeller. Such an installation is much more flexible than a mechanical connection since the prime movers can be physically distributed to best utilize the available space and can also be instantly connected to or disconnected from the propulsion circuit. The use of synchronous a-c machinery has a number of attractive features. The motors and generators are smaller and lighter, have higher efficiencies, lower maintenance, and lower first cost than equivalent d-c machines. However, there are also some disadvantages. The speed range of the propelling motor is limited to that of the prime mover because there is a fixed ratio between generator and motor speed. Also, there is no means of varying the motor speed-torque ratio such as can be obtained by using d-c machinery. Thus, the use of a-c Diesel-electric drive is limited to vessels making relatively long voyages at a more or less fixed speed and where maneuvering is of relatively small importance. Direct current, on the other hand, has almost ideal characteristics for use in supplying propelling power to tugboats, ferries, dredges, and ice-breaking vessels, which are almost continuously maneuvering and operating under varied conditions of loading."
"STEEL ingots produced at the Fairless Works are first reduced for further processing by the most powerful combination of reversing mills which has ever been built. The largest ingots are rolled in a universal slabbing mill and are transferred direct to a hot-strip mill. Smaller ingots are first reduced to rectangular blooms in the slabbing mill and then are transferred to a high-speed 40-inch reversing blooming mill for further reduction to intermediate sizes. This combination has many unique mechanical and electrical features."
"Dieselization of steam railroads abroad has recently been proceeding at a greatly accelerated pace. This has served to fix attention on the need for a motor suitable for general freight and passenger service on track gauges down to 1 meter, and with axle loads limited to 44,000 pounds per axle. A motor designed for such applications was placed in production last year. Its characteristics give a locomotive performance, within these limitations, comparable to that of many domestic units. Surveys indicate that this covers the needs of a great majority of narrow-gauge operations."
"RECENTLY, studies of sampled-data control systems have been published1,2 which furnish exact and approximate expressions for the closed-loop transient response to an arbitrary external disturbance. However, the computations required are exceedingly tedious, even for the simplest type of system. Alternatively, a locus plotted in the frequency domain has been proposed by Linvill,1 to permit studies to be made of closed-loop stability (in accordance with Nyquist's criterion). Here again the computations are tedious. It is further pointed out that the Nyquist plot obtained in this manner applies only at the sampling instants and, as such, the well-known techniques pertaining to relative stability of continuous systems do not readily apply, although absolute stability is well defined by this technique. Consequently, in most practical situations, the designer has found it expedient to resort to analogue computer studies to determine how the transient response depends upon such factors as the sampling frequency or the velocity constant of the proposed system. The purpose of this paper is to furnish a set of dimensionless curves, based upon computer studies, which are of a sufficiently generalized nature to permit approximate design criteria to be established for a wide variety of system transfer functions."
"THE mathematical synthesis problem in linear servomechanism design is to find the description of the system when the desired output response to a given input is specified. The desired output, however, is often defined as the best that can be obtained, where the word “best” has several connotations which include fastest transient response, minimum overshoot, and minimum tendency toward persistent oscillations. Under the assumption that there are no restrictions on the values that a sufficient number of system parameters may take, it is possible to apply suitable criteria and select the optimum response in a normalized time scale. The optimum response may then, theoretically at least, be reproduced, by adjustment of the system parameters, to an arbitrary time scale."
"Recent trends in industrial control equipment have been toward the use of static devices. The objective has been to secure greater reliability, lower maintenance costs, and more accurate control. Absolute reliability is a prime requisite for railroad locomotive control. Substitution of easily serviced packages of static equipment for rotating machines and dynamic regulators of all types is one advance toward this ultimate of absolute reliability."
"IN VIEW of the findings of research, an effort has been made to control ionization of air in the design of electric space-heating and air-conditioning equipment. Extensive studies show that ionization of the air has a physiological effect on people breathing the air, and it is reasoned that air-conditioning should not inadvertently change any property of fresh outdoor air if a change can reasonably be avoided."
"THE performance of 208/120-volt 400-cycle constant-frequency aircraft electric power systems under abnormal conditions resulting from synchronizing disturbances, loss of field excitation, and short circuits is described. As a basis for this study, tests were made on 40-kva alternators, to determine their electrical parameters. The values of these parameters expressed in per unit are listed in Table I."
"THE person analyzing or synthesizing a closed-loop control system often has need of sinusoidal transfer function data. If the data are to be obtained directly, ordinarily a measurement is made of both phase and magnitude of the sinusoidal response to a sinusoidal driving force. A low variable-frequency generator of sufficient power is required, as well as a means of measuring phase and magnitude of the sinusoidal response quantity. The phase-angle measurement is often troublesome and rather inaccurate at the low frequencies which are commonly employed in the closed-loop control system. Sometimes nonlinearities further aggravate the problem."
"SAN FRANCISCO is situated on the northern extremity of a peninsula, surrounded on three sides by water. Its population of 800,000 is confined within a rectangular area of 43 square miles. It is one of the hilliest cities in the United States, with land elevations varying between sea level and 930 feet. North of Market Street and the diagonal line bisecting the city, the streets are laid out in a substantially north-south, east-west grid pattern; see Fig. 1. South of this line the street pattern is made up either of smaller grids, oriented in many different directions, or of contour streets in and around the hillier sections."
"THE root locus method for analyzing feedback control systems has become increasingly popular over the last few years. However, the great potentialities of the method have yet to be realized. The method has had the drawback of presenting only the transient response of the system under study. An ideal method of analysis and synthesis would allow the engineer to arrive at both the transient and the steady-state sinusoidal response without any large amount of extra work involved for either. The work would progress in two stages. The first stage would take a relatively short time to complete and would yield approximations to both the closed-loop transient response and the frequency response. At this point, various design features could be compared. The second stage would be an extension of the work done in the first stage - not a more detailed rework of the problem. This second stage of the problem would yield exact and complete transient and sinusoidal solutions."
"Aircraft application of regulated frequency a-c power obtained from main-engine driven sources requires a generator drive capable of providing a controlled output speed independent of airplane engine operation. Performance of a variable ratio hydraulic-mechanical drive utilizing engine shaft power for this purpose is presented. General characteristics and service experience covering an actual installation are included."
"DURING flight tests at Goodyear Aircraft Corporation it was necessary to ascertain the exact location of the airplane with respect to its plotted course. For this purpose a camera was so mounted in the airplane that it was stabilized with respect to earth co-ordinates in three axes while the airplane was undergoing turns and random maneuvers. Two types of servo (stabilization systems) were considered, a motor-and-gear drive system, and a rate gyro system. The motor-and-gear system proved the more suitable. A torque source drive system is presently being investigated. A prototype has been built, and testing has begun."
"DURING the past 5 years transient analysis of aircraft a-c generators has become increasingly important. The vast number of excellent technical papers1‾3 published on this subject would indicate that no problem existed, and a literature survey would yield a solution to any problem no matter what the degree of complexity. However, problems do exist in transforming from conventional power frequencies to 400 cycles per second (cps) aircraft equipments and in ascertaining the idealizations which other authors used in the formulation of the various papers."
"HUNDREDS of installations have proved the reliability and economy of remote control on electric power systems and in large industrial plants. Although the initial application of supervisory control to pipe-line pumping was made 23 years ago,1 it is only recently that the costs of station attendance have risen to a level where management has taken active interest in its possibilities. At present there is a lively interest in the subject. Within the past 3 years installations have been made or equipment put into manufacture for at least 15 remote control projects on pipe lines transporting crude oil, refined petroleum products, or gas, with an unprecedented number of such projects now under active study. This paper is written to better acquaint pipe-line engineers with the principles of remote control and its application to pipe-line service. It concerns only remote-control systems which include indication of the condition of the remotely operated equipment."
"In the early stages of development, use can be made of thermal transmission line analysis of theoretical or analogue computer type for evaluation of proposed configurations of such an item as an electrically heated deicer boot. Direct laboratory evaluations of samples are reported in which synthetic thermal transmission line terminations substitute both for theoretical analysis and for flight or icing tunnel test. The findings of theoretical analyses of electrically heated windshield problems are reported in the Appendix. These findings are applied to the boot problem."
"THE requirements for electric power-in modern pulp and paper mills are increasing at greater rates than the requirements for thermal power. In consequence, the electric power that can be generated by the normal flow rate of process steam is becoming inadequate. Low-cost hogged fuel and mill waste are also no longer available in abundant quantities to generate the increasing unbalance in electric load with condensing steam. Therefore, mill operators are finding it more economical to purchase a portion of their electric energy from utility power systems rather than to operate their own generating equipment on more expensive fuels and with consequent heat loss to the condensing water."
"One of the formidable problems in the area of feedback control concerns the analysis and synthesis of nonlinear systems. Of the several methods available for treating nonlinear systems, one of the more widely used is the sinusoidal response method. Valuable information about the characteristics of nonlinear systems can be obtained from the open-loop frequency response, but the full potential of this method has not been exploited because apparently there is no widely accepted procedure for determining the closed-loop frequency response. This paper describes a method whereby the closed-loop frequency response of an important class of nonlinear systems can be determined easily. Development of this method is dependent upon representing the nonlinear element as a so-called equivalent gain. The method is described and illustrated by analytically determining the closed-loop frequency response of an acceleration-limited system and an error-limited system. The results of the use of this method compare favorably with solutions of the two problems as obtained from an analogue computer. A few of the nonlinear phenomena which can be reasonably approximated by this method are saturation, limiting, backlash, and dead space."

"THE marked increase in electrolytic cell-operating currents in the past decade has emphasized the need for a simple, dependable, and inexpensive high-current switch for use as a cell short-circuiting switch. In the electrothermal field, the magnitude of furnace currents has also been increasing as it has become evident that higher furnace currents lead to better operating economies. Earlier types of switches become cumbersome and expensive when built in ratings of higher than about 6,000 amperes. This paper traces the development of a new type of switch and illustrates how the new switch is applicable to both a-c and d-c low-voltage circuits."
"OPTIMUM switching of second-order contactor servomechanisms has been treated in the literature. A method of approximating this performance without the use of relays or computers consists of substituting a particular type of network and a limiter for the computer and relays. A procedure is given for obtaining the characteristics of this network. It is illustrated by examples and experimental results. This type of linear compensation yields results that are better than those obtained by conventional linear compensation having uncontrolled saturation."
"THE utility of servomechanisms in their many applications depends on the speed, stability, and accuracy of their responses. These three characteristics, or the lack of them, may be observed in the responses of a servomechanism to test inputs. The error, which is the difference between the input and the output of the device, is used to actuate the control in a direction which tends to remove the error. In order to achieve the best performance under both transient and equilibrium conditions, it often has been found expedient to employ, as an additional correction signal, either the derivative or the time integral of the error, or both. The servomechanism is then said to have derivative and/or integral control. The present paper reports an investigation of the transient performance of low-order, linear servomechanisms with derivative and integral control."
"This paper discusses the fundamental processes involved in the production of current in a lead acid cell, particularly as they are related to the peformance of the cell when furnishing variable or intermittent loads or a combination of both. A method of determining the size of cell required for various duty cycles is described and a general equation is derived, which, with certain restrictions, will indicate the number of positive plates required in each cell of a battery of the type selected for the application."
"THE equilibrium relations of lead-acid storage batteries have been extensively studied. The double-sulfate theory proposed by Gladstone and Tribe1 has been substantiated by analytical methods,2 thermodynamic studies,3 and electromotive force measurements of galvanic cells simulating the charged state of the electrochemical system.4 It is well recognized that on discharge one equivalent each of lead dioxide and lead and two equivalents of sulfuric acid are consumed and that two equivalents of lead sulfate and two equivalents of water are formed per faraday. It is known that the reverse occurs on charge and that the lead-acid storage battery may be subjected to many cycles of charge and discharge. The battery is reversible in that chemical and electric energy may be interconverted in repeated cycles. In practice, reversibility in the thermodynamic sense is not completely realized and the voltage during discharge is somewhat lower than the reversible electromotive force. Likewise the charging voltage is correspondingly higher. The more rapid the charging and discharging the greater is the deviation from thermodynamic reversibility and the greater is the loss in energy efficiency."
"The diesel-electric locomotive has been universally substituted for the steam locomotive on most of the railroads in this country. Railway electrification has not had further application during this period. Many believe this to be an indication that the economies of the diesel over the steam locomotive apply equally to electric operation as well. This opinion is debated. Power costs, investment costs, fixed charges, maintenance costs, and other operating costs of both diesel-electric and electric operation are compared. Stress is laid on the greater rise in maintenance costs, with age, of the diesel-electric than those of the electric locomotive. It is believed that when the difference in all these costs is fully determined, electrification will again be applied to certain parts of the American railroads having good load factors where electric power is available because of its greater economy. Commercial frequency applied to the contact wire at higher voltage, and the rectifier locomotive, offer means of standardizing future railway electrification. Examples are cited of studies recently made for electrification of this type in South America, and for a hypothetical installation in this country, to illustrate cost comparisons brought out in the paper."
"This paper introduces a sinusoidal response method of analysis and synthesis of a contactor servomechanism employing sampled data. Because of the presence of sampler, clamper, and contactor, the system is discontinuous in time as well as being nonlinear. The sinusoidal method provides a useful guide in analysis and synthesis. It enables one to determine the conditions of occurrence of self-sustained oscillations and their amplitudes and frequencies; and to evaluate critical values of certain system parameters. Electronic analogue computer techniques are employed to check the accuracy of the sinusoidal response method."
"IN RECENT years the trend has been to apply ignitron rectifiers as a power supply for continuous hot strip mill main drive service. As in numerous other fields, the versatile ignitron is again demonstrating its many inherent economic advantages over conventional rotating machines and proving its rugged dependability for main drive service."
"FLASHING is one of the important considerations in the manufacture and operation of electrical equipment for diesel-electric locomotives. Its importance has increased with the placing in service of a large number of high-speed and high-powered road locomotives during the past six or seven years. Examination of a large number of motors and generators of different manufacture on high-speed road locomotives has indicated that the machine which shows no evidence of flashing is an exception. Flashing may occur without any appreciable damage to a motor or generator or any interruption of service. Flashing, on the other hand, may be so serious that the locomotive cannot continue in service or that a motor or generator has to be removed for repair."
"UNTIL the advent of the dual-element fuse, co-ordinated fuse protection for low-voltage distribution systems was virtually impossible because the time-current characteristic of the nonrenewable and renewable fuse did not match the safe time-current characteristic of the circuit. Even short-circuit protection on a-c distribution systems was doubtful because of the lack of data on the interrupting capacity of nonrenewable and renewable fuses. The greatly enhanced time-lag characteristic of the dual-element fuse makes it possible to protect the low-voltage system against dangerous overloads and its interrupting capacity assures satisfactory performance under fault conditions. Since dual-element fuses only are made in National Electrical Code sizes, the Hi-Cap fuse was designed in ratings up to 5,000 amperes to fill co-ordinated fuse protection needs."
"MACHINE tools in which material removal is effected by the action of successive electric sparks are commercially available in the United States, most western European countries, and are known to be in extensive use in the Soviet Union. As a substitute for industrial diamond tools in the machining of hard materials and as a means of performing machining operations which are otherwise impossible, electric spark machining has attracted extensive industrial interest. An earlier paper1 described the basic process and a theory which explains the phenomena of spark machining. The purpose of this paper is to describe the results of further research into the fundamental processes and some design trends in the electric circuits of spark machine tools."
"IN FIG. 1 is shown a compensator cascaded with a control system. The combination will be called the compensated system. In this paper the transfer function of the control system is assumed to be linear and that for the compensator is at least piecewise linear. Each compensator discussed in the paper has incorporated, within its structure, a delay line or short-time memory unit, Fig. 2, into which information is inserted and from which the same information is extracted at various short intervals of time thereafter. The extracted information at each location is multiplied by a suitable constant and the results are summed to form rx(t)."
"SEVERAL months ago every publication devoted to power and those covering industry in general carried articles telling the story of magnetic amplifiers. They told of using magnetic amplifiers with servomechanisms for automatic pilots, to control speeds of large motors, to regulate voltages of large generators, and any number of other applications, in some cases replacing equipment that had been accepted as standard for years."
"The purpose of a circuit protector (CP) is to clear faults and thus permit the remainder of the system to continue normal operation. The function of overvoltage protection is to prevent damage to utilization equipment by de-energizing the generator when system overvoltage exists. Proper co-ordination is necessary to prevent nuisance tripping of the overvoltage relay (OVR) during low-resistance faults."
"Aircraft electric system designers have several methods available for providing generator protection. These include overcurrent devices (thermal and magnetic), differential current devices (balanced current and zone type), and directional sensing devices (the familiar reverse current cutout)."
"The purpose of this paper is to call attention to system malfunctions which may occur on parallel-connected, aircraft, a-c electric power systems. These malfunctions must be considered when an integrated study is made of the protection and operation of these systems. A list and discussion of these malfunctions is presented. It is hoped that this paper will stimulate discussion which will provide more nearly complete coverage of the problems associated with this type of system."
"Electric cables installed in aircraft are normally tied together in bundles for a portion of the cable run from the bus to the individual load device. As a consequence, the temperature of a particular cable depends not only on the current which it carries but also on the currents which flow simultaneously in other cables of the group. The problem of the current capacity of cables in bundles can be stated as follows: given any set of currents, how shall individual cables of the proper size be selected so that their limiting temperature is not exceeded when the cables are arranged in a bundle; or, stated conversely, given any specified bundle of cables, what is the combination of currents which may be carried by the cable group."
"The race for automaticity has allowed little time for simplification and cost reduction. We have automatic jet engine control as a function of ten parameters employing 30 vacuum tubes. But do we have adequate reliability? In view of these problems, this paper investigates the simplest information sensing and control element for servomechanisms -sensitive electric contacts. Contact protection and reliability are carried beyond the scope of electric networks and a mechanical solution is proposed to the remaining problem of metal build-up. Reliable operation on 50 microwatts of input signal power, 200,000 times power amplification, 4-ounce weight, cigarette package size, no heat-dissipation problem, no stand-by power required for cathode heating, and tens of millions of cycles of operation may be the reward of further study of sensitive contact signal sensing devices."
"In military aircraft, the growth of electric power consumption has been very large. The load requirements have led to the desirability of developing a-c systems rather than producing power as direct current and then converting to meet the a-c load requirements. For the most part, single-generator systems or combinations of single-generator systems using split-bus arrangements have been used. Need for higher-reliability systems, having greater reserve capacity, and making higher utilization of generator capacity through the diversification of load equipment leads to the conclusion that parallel systems should be used in future aircraft."
"The past few years have witnessed the increasing use of alternating current in large military aircraft, to the point where systems of paralleled alternators are required to meet the load demand. Such systems have problems and malfunctions of a type not encountered with isolated alternators or with paralleled d-c generators. As a result, new control and protective techniques must be developed for paralleled a-c systems if adequate reliability is to be obtained."
"Based on simultaneous solutions of algebraic equations, resultant values of excitation voltage are obtained for a regulated a-c generator operating under unbalanced conditions. These equations result from a detailed consideration of the reaction to unbalance of the regulator system components. In general, solutions of the equations can be obtained graphically; in some cases, they can be attained analytically. Both methods are applied to representative examples of regulated aircraft generators operating at 400 cycles. Once the excitation voltage is determined for a given unbalance, symmetrical components are applied to obtain voltages and currents. An accuracy of better than 10 per cent is estimated."
"The differential-type hydraulic transmission has been used as a constant speed drive for aircraft a-c generators for approximately 8 years. The experience gained in this time on both the B36 and P5M airplanes has been a major factor in establishing future aircraft electrical system and component requirements. However, the final decision to establish closer electrical system tolerances for voltage and frequency, real and reactive load balance, and necessary fault protection should be determined on the basis of component and system reliability, simplicity, and performance. The following discussion considers these important characteristics for the components controlling system frequency, real-load division between paralleled a-c generators, and automatic paralleling of a-c generators. The improvements in new system performance were gained by utilizing components with faster response times, and also by the introduction of nonlinear circuit elements. Design and performance details are cited to substantiate steady-state frequency control to within 0.25 per cent of 400 cycles per second, real-load division to within 2 kw, and automatic paralleling of generators to maintain current transients within generator full-load ratings."
"This bibliography is an attempt to collect a reasonably complete set of references pertaining to the concept of feedback, its applications, and consequences, up to the year 1952. These references necessarily touch upon many fields of engineering and also contain a number of items on related topics. Although the material has been divided into a number of broad categories, it should be recognized that many references could appear with almost equal validity under more than one topic. The classification is therefore somewhat arbitrary and the reader is advised to look over related topics in all cases. Within each category the items are arranged chronologically, A list of periodicals is given on pages 460-62."
"The frequency response method of analysis of servomechanisms has been extensively applied in the analysis and synthesis of linear systems, and several studies have shown that useful results can be obtained in certain nonlinear cases. The application of the sinusoidal frequency response method to nonlinear systems has been based on the assumption that the input to the nonlinear element is sinusoidal and that the behavior of the complete system can be satisfactorily represented by considering only its fundamental Fourier series component. Tustin and Goldfarb applied this method to the analysis of servomechanisms having backlash and non-viscous friction.1,2 Kochenburger has found good experimental agreement with the theoretical results of this method in several contactor servomechanisms.3 He has shown that this method serves as a useful guide in designing appropriate linear equalizing networks to improve their performance. These networks allow the system to remain stable for smaller dead zones and also give a higher range of frequency over which the contactor servomechanism's output reproduces its input with small error. He used this method to compute the over-all frequency response for various amplitudes of the sinusoidal input to the system and showed that it was possible to obtain well damped performance as evidenced by a low resonance peak. Johnson has shown how the gain phase angle transfer locus may be used to indicate the presence of sustained constant amplitude oscillation in a nonlinear system and has shown that nonlinear equalizing networks may be used to eliminate sustained oscillations and improve system performance.4 In this paper the amplitude and period of sustained oscillations computed by this method for a velocity lag servomechanism incorporating only one time constant (which will be referred to as the motor time constant) will be compared with an exact treatment of this problem given by Oldenbourg and Sartorius.5"
"A problem of frequent occurrence in servomechanism analysis and design is that of determining the maximum modulus Mm, and the angular frequency at which it occurs, of the over-all frequency-transfer function M(jω) = C(jω)/R(jω). Those textbooks1¯4 which present a comprehensive, integrated account of basic servomechanism theory advance, in considerable detail, two procedures for determining the maximum modulus Mm of M(jω) for a unity feedback system, namely, by plot of the transfer function G(jω) on a chart of circles of constant values of modulus |M(jω)|, or on a Nichol's chart of circles of constant values of modulus |M(jω)|. Further, if the feedback transfer function H(s) although nonunity is yet a pure numeric H(s) = Kn, then, according to well-known theory $\\eqalignno{{C(j \\, \\omega) \\over R (j \\, \\omega)} = M (j \\omega) \\cr = {1 \\over K_{h}} \\, {G(j \\omega) K_h \\over 1 +G(j \\omega) K_{h}} \\cr = {1 \\over K_{j}} \\times M_{1}(j \\omega) \\hbox{(1)}}$ and Mm can yet be determined by obtaining M1m through plot of G1(jω) = G(jω)Kh as just mentioned and thence calculating Mm from Mm = M1m/Kh."
"The Detroit Committee on Electrolysis is a voluntary organization of companies and municipal departments constituted for finding the best engineering solution to the electrolysis and corrosion problems confronting its members. There are over 25 cities and areas in the United States and Canada which have active electrolysis committees including New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Southern Ontario, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Omaha, Des Moines, Louisville, Miami, and, of course, many others. The Detroit Committee has been chosen as the subject of this paper not only because it is typical of such committees, but also because it has had a long and outstanding history."

"SURFACE traffic congestion and the high cost of subway construction have caused renewed interest in elevated mass transit. The necessity to eliminate noise and to avoid shutting off light and air, both of which have been characteristic of the old elevated lines has focused interest on the monorail, or suspended railway, form of transportation. Modernization of the monorail type of transportation led to research for ways to simplify, lighten, and minimize the required space of all components of the equipment. One outstanding result, incorporated in a recently completed report to the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority, was adoption of the squirrel-cage induction motor working in combination with a torque converter drive as the propulsion equipment, in place of the d-c series motor and its involved rheostatic voltage control. The resulting performance characteristics are the equal of the most recent series motor equipment proposed for comparable service. Besides weight and space advantages on the rolling stock, a substantial reduction in power supply apparatus costs results from the direct use of usual 3-phase 60-cycle electric energy without the expense and the complication of special conversion to direct current."
"An effective equipment-grounding system should, under conditions of maximum ground-fault current flow, accomplish the following objectives: 1. maintain a low potential difference, perhaps 50 volts maximum, between machine frames, equipment enclosures, conductor enclosures, building metallic structure, and metallic components contained therein to avoid electric shock hazard and unwanted circulating current, and 2. incorporate adequate conductance to carry this maximum ground short-circuit current without thermal distress and the attendant fire hazard. There is good reason to believe that current flow in the equipment-grounding system in a-c power systems will not stray far from the power cable over which the outgoing current flows. It follows that the installation of conductive material in an equipment ground system unless properly located can be ineffective and wasteful, and can create a false sense of security. This paper presents the results of a special series of full-scale tests dealing with this specific problem and a general analysis of the circuit behavior."
"A method is given for establishing the describing functions and transfer function for a servomechanism with saturation and hysteresis nonlinearities. This method makes use of a technique given by V. B. Haas, Jr. (in a personal communication to the authors) in measuring the phase and amplitude of the first harmonic of the system output with respect to a sinusoidal input."
"IN THE past few years there has been considerable interest in sampled-data feedback control systems.1-6 In most cases, this interest was brought about by the fact that many data-gathering and transmission systems, such as radars, data links and similar components handled data in a sampled form. More recently, the contemplated use of digital computers, in essence sampled-data devices, in connection with process control, has necessitated some study of means for utilizing their capacity to compute for purposes of stabilizing and shaping control systems.7,8 By their nature, digital computers are sampled-data systems since their output is intermittent and in numerical form."
"SAMPLED-DATA feedback control systems, or pulsed servomechanisms, are characterized by the distinguishing feature that at one or more points in the system signal information is in the form of a pulse train which can be represented as a sequence of numbers. One example in which the signal information inherently is represented by a sequence of numbers is provided by a closed-loop system containing a digital computer as one element. Sampled-data systems are also useful when the energy available from a sensitive element is so small that it is imperative to avoid loading the output more than necessary."
"Variable-frequency a-c systems and paralleled d-c supplies operating simultaneously from the same a-c generators and with the elimination of transformers, voltage regulators, and reverse-current relays from the d-c supplies are proposed as a means of increasing aircraft reliability and of reducing costs, complexity, and weight. The suggested system can be connected to provide either a single direct voltage or two direct voltages obtained without transformers and without interfering with the simultaneous use of the a-c generators for conventional variable-frequency a-c loads."
"Practical and theoretical considerations relative to automatic paralleling of aircraft a-c generators are presented. Different types of a-c generator systems are classified generally as to requirements, and paralleling assumptions are proposed as design criteria. Synchronizing requirements as determined by subtransient and transient disturbance to the system, and paralleling requirements as determined by steady-state load division are presented. Considerations applicable to the development of autoparalleling systems are also discussed."
"When a fault occurs on an aircraft a-c system with voltage-regulated alternators, the short-circuit current goes through a transient period depending on the alternator-regulator characteristic. This transient period has been found to vary from several milliseconds to perhaps 300 milliseconds and, consequently, may have a considerable effect on fuse or current-limiter clearing times. This paper presents a method of calculating current-limiter or fuse-clearing times which includes the effect of this transient period. Results of calculations from this method are compared with laboratory tests demonstrating that the method has a reasonable degree of accuracy."
"Traffic congestion resulting from the increased use of vehicles on our city streets has reached the point where drastic measures are needed to permit freer movement of people within the metropolitan area. One of the brightest hopes for relief is high-speed rapid transit operating on private rights of way. This paper describes the performance which can be obtained with a conventional rail rapid transit system utilizing recent advances in propulsion equipment."
"AIRCRAFT electric power systems are comprised of the following four elements: prime mover, generation, distribution, and utilization. Each of these elements is interdependent and decisions affecting any one element may also influence decisions on the others. The interdependence is evident in any problems related to performance on economy of the electric power system."
"Reactive load unbalance among paralleled generators is analyzed to relate the largest unbalance with the sensitivity of the reactive load division circuit employed in the regulators and with the regulation characteristics of the individual generator-exciter-regulator units. The maximum permissible sensitivity of the reactive load division circuit is found, from stability considerations, to be determined by the unsaturated synchronous reactance of the paralleled generators. The design of the reactive load division circuit is discussed from a system viewpoint."
"THE synchronous generator with direct-driven exciter has several disadvantages when applied in airborne equipment. However, no competing system has succeeded in achieving a smaller weight in pounds per kva at a given speed. The practical difficulties are overcome at present by careful engineering, so that a reliable generating system is obtained. These difficulties relate to brush performance at high altitude, commutation at high speed, overhung moment due to the action of exciter, bracing of the rotor windings against centrifugal force, and high cost of manufacture."
"MOTORS of 250 horsepower (hp) and larger, as used in oil refineries, may drive reciprocating compressors, centrifugal compressors, or centrifugal pumps. They may be located in areas where explosive hazards exist in varying degree, where corrosive or abrasive conditions prevail, or they may operate in normal ambient conditions."
"It has been stated that the only real obstacle to push-button warfare is the design of an adequate switch. Unfortunately, aircraft switch design and application have lagged behind the need of the industry. One of the most effective ways to shorten this lag is to learn more about switches and switching problems. In this regard a scientific switch-testing procedure is proposed in this article. Consideration is given to factors that determine switch merit. These factors include insulation, contact operation, peak voltage transients, and switch mechanisms. Simulation of inductive loads is discussed as a means of obtaining more realistic test results."
"SEVERAL utilities have adapted 480-volt multiple-unit secondary-network installations or spot networks to supply high concentrations of power load, such as air conditioning, in commercial buildings since about 1937. The increasing incidence of these power loads in big buildings in commercial areas and their occurrence in institutional buildings, laboratory and office buildings, and shopping centers in urban and suburban areas encouraged the consideration of some voltage higher than 120/208 volts for supplying such loads. The use of 265 volts for fluorescent lighting in industrial plants suggests that attention should be focused on 265/460 volts as a desirable voltage for supplying the loads in new or rewired commercial buildings."
"The Edison Electric Institute - National Electrical Manufacturers Association standard nominal system voltage designation of the higher voltage system referred to in this paper is 480 wye/277 volts. The maximum system voltage is 480 wye/277 and the average utilization voltage will be more nearly 460 wye/265 volts. To be consistent with the lower class designation, such as 208 wye/120 volts which is an average utilization voltage, some utilities have selected 460 wye/265 volts as a nominal system voltage designation. Whether the higher voltage system is called 480 wye/277 or 460 wye/265 volts, it is precisely the same system and has the same voltage spread."
"THE adoption of higher secondary voltages in commercial areas1 involves the careful consideration of suitable voltage spreads and the corresponding plausible voltage levels for supplying utilization equipment. There is urgent need for the industry to select a level that will be generally suitable and acceptable in order to avoid a variety of voltages in various parts of the country and the corresponding variety of equipment ratings."
"The Edison Electric Institute — National Electrical Manufacturers Association standard nominal system voltage designation of the higher voltage system referred to in this paper is 480 wye/277 volts. The maximum system voltage is 480 wye/277 and the average utilization voltage will be more nearly 460 wye/265 volts. To be consistent with the lower class designation, such as 208 wye/120 volts which is an average utilization voltage, some utilities have selected 460 wye/265 volts as a nominal system voltage designation. Whether the higher voltage system is called 480 wye/277 or 460 wye/265 volts, it is the same system and has the same voltage spread."
"IN the design of a closed-loop control system, it is necessary to study the dynamic characteristics of the control circuit and its components to determine their effect upon accuracy, speed of response, and stability. While the advent of analogue computers has greatly simplified these studies, difficulties are encountered in setting up analogues that incorporate the same nonlinearities and operate at the same power levels as the equipment involved. To provide a means of obtaining more accurate information, the special high-power servo analyzer described in this paper was designed and constructed; see Fig. 1. Its function is to determine the frequency response curves, both magnitudes and phase shifts, of actual apparatus operating at normal power level. This servo analyzer has been used to study the characteristics of aircraft electric generating systems; however, it could be employed in the design of any type of control system. Thus, the development of the servo analyzer adds another design tool to those already available for control system design."
"THE Fairless Works of the United States Steel Corporation, located on a bend in the Delaware River near Morrisville, Pa., was designed as a completely integrated plant, capable of processing raw materials into finished steel products, ready for industrial use. Seldom in the history of steel mills have engineers had the opportunity to design so complete an undertaking in its entirety, and thereby to take advantage of past experience from both technical and economic standpoints. This paper deals with the electric power system which supplies the loads of the various mill areas. Fig. 1 is a scale drawing which shows the high-voltage substations and transmission lines of the Fairless Works. The technical and economic considerations used as a basis for the design and operation of this system will be discussed."
"THE metering system commonly used in radio noise meters includes a special type of voltmeter, the development of which is one of the steps leading toward practical instruments for evaluating the influence of electric power apparatus on radio reception. Early developments in this field were introduced through the efforts of groups representing the electric-apparatus manufacturers, power companies, radio apparatus manufacturers and services. Radio noise meters and test methods have been gradually improved as a result of experience, and progress reported from time to time. General features of radio noise meters and test methods were discussed in 1943.1 The over-all performance of a representative type of noise meter, using square wave input voltage to simulate noise, was analyzed in 1945.2 Several meter circuits of the type applied to radio noise meters are analyzed in this paper."
"THIS paper describes a magnetic amplifier developed to meet the need for a versatile, reliable, easily reproducible operational component for a low-level servo-control system. The subject amplifier also exhibits unusual stability, linearity, and freedom from drift, which are requirements of prime importance in this particular application."
"THE application of the telephone repeater, the development of which made countrywide telephone service practicable, had been confined largely to toll plant from the year 1915 when the transcontinental line was first established, until a few years ago. About 1948 the negative-impedance repeater1 was developed and placed in production. This repeater operates on the principle of inserting negative resistance (and, if desired, negative inductance or capacitance) in series with the line, thus reducing the over-all impedance and increasing the current in the line. This results in transmission gain in the same sense as that resulting from a repeater of the conventional type. This principle and the package nature of the assembly resulted in a telephone repeater so low in cost and so simple in application and installation that it has found extensive use primarily in the local telephone plant."
"THE insertion of repeaters in telephone lines to make up for circuit losses is a very common practice today. The use of negative impedance to overcome transmission loss is an old idea but only recently used to any large extent in the exchange area plant. A series-type of negative-impedance repeater, called the E1 telephone repeater, has found favor in the Bell System and its use has stimulated a demand for still more economical designs including a companion shunt type of negative-impedance repeater. Sufficient laboratory and field trial work has been done on negative-impedance devices to insure that better transmission performance can be obtained, at minimum cost, by using both a shunt element, of the negative-admittance type, and a series type of negative-impedance repeater. Through the use of these new E-type repeaters it is possible to reduce the attenuation and improve the return loss of voice frequency lines so that exchange area trunks can be used as links in a toll connection."
"IN THE exchange telephone plant, speech is transmitted largely at voice frequencies over a single pair of wires which carries both directions of conversation. Until recently, these circuits were mostly unrepeatered, adequate transmission being assured through a suitable choice of coil loading and conductor size. The need for low-cost repeaters for the exchange plant had long been recognized, but it had not been economical to use widely the conventional hybrid type of repeater with separate amplifiers for the two directions of conversation. The E1 repeater introduced in 1949 was the first device designed specifically to meet the needs of the exchange plant. It is a bilateral device, which provides gain in both directions of conversation without the use of hybrid coils or line filters and with the use of but a single transmission network.1 This simplicity, together with the fact that it imposes little impairment on the signaling of the exchange plant, makes it well suited to introducing amplification in 2-wire circuits."
"WITH the availability of high-quality magnetic core materials, it has become possible to develop very efficient magnetic frequency multipliers. The advance of the electronic arts in the development of computers and precise control systems has created the immediate need for frequency multipliers which can produce exact multiplication of frequencies in power levels ranging from milliwatts to one kilowatt. Magnetic frequency multipliers as described in this paper have superior characteristics to electronic multipliers in that they use no tubes, moving parts, or rectifiers. Consequently, they are rugged, efficient, insensitive to temperature variations, and can deliver large quantities of power."
"High-speed electronic counters have become commercially available within the past few years which indicate by means of a display of neon-lighted figures, and can count from 20 to 100,000 events per second or more with an inherent accuracy of ±1 count in the measuring interval. By relatively simple modifications of the basic counting circuits in these instruments they can also be used for measuring short intervals of time to an accuracy of ± 10 microseconds. The measured time interval is displayed directly in figures indicating the decimal fraction of a second to the nearest hundred-thousandth. Tachometry is a fruitful application of these instruments. Three methods of using the counters in tachometry are described here, and the advantages and limitations of each method are discussed."
"DIGITAL computers have been used extensively in the solution of mathematical problems requiring both speed and accuracy in their computation. More recently, digital computers are being employed to control analogue equipment. The control of machine tools is one example of this application.1"
"The occurrence of instabilities in magnetic amplifiers with inductive d-c load is well known. Less known, however, is the mechanism causing the instability, of which a published analysis is believed nonexistent. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the mechanics of instability qualitatively and quantitatively and to explain some of the means by which this instability can be averted."
"IN USING the conventional a-c network analyzer to solve transient-stability problems, it is necessary to resort to a step-by-step process which is both time-consuming and tedious although the power flow data can be obtained at each step directly from the analyzer. The subject of the rapid evaluation of system swing curves has recently attracted the engineering interest and needs the attention that it now seems to be receiving. This paper describes the design features of a 10-kc network analyzer in which computing elements are incorporated in the feedback loop which relates the electric power output with the phase shifter in such a way that a dynamic representation for a transient-stability solution can be directly obtained on the analyzer itself."
"IN SOME instrument applications, batteries are used as sources of d-c power because they are portable, and free of internal noise (except for slow changes with temperature and time), and because they can be completely shielded from external noise. These advantages are frequently offset, however, by problems of size, weight, and replacement, and as a result increasing use is being made of a-c powered electronic d-c power supplies for a-c amplifiers, d-c amplifiers, and d-c potentiometers for voltage measurement. Although such electronic d-c supplies require a-c input power, this requirement is generally not objectionable because a-c power outlets are conveniently available. Means for suppressing the effects of line voltage fluctuation are often required for a-c amplifiers, generally required for d-c amplifiers, and always required for d-c potentiometers for voltage measurement.1 The use of a series (rheostat) tube with an appropriate d-c control amplifier and voltage reference has been generally accepted as a preferred way to accomplish this,2 an example of which is shown in Fig. 1. The heavy lines indicate the path of the power to the load RL. The series rheostat tube, under the control of the components indicated by light lines, stabilizes the d-c load voltage VL."
"A RECENT paper1 advances equations enabling calculation of the inductance and short-circuit forces of busses comprised of double-channel conductors, as shown in Fig. 1 of that paper. These quantities are the essential parameters required for the rational design of this currently much-used bus. In an advertisement2 it is stated that this type of construction is used in “11 out of the 16 largest turbine-generator” installations. The correctness and the usefulness of these equations in actual design are manifested by the valuable complementary discussion1 of this recent paper given by O. R. Schurig, who compared values of reactance determined experimentally on a typical 3-phase bus comprised of 6-inch aluminum channels with values calculated from the equations of reference 1 and found good agreement among corresponding experimentally and analytically determined values."
"ON JUNE 1, 1953, the Illinois Power Company's new power station near Hennepin, Ill., went into service, adding 75,000 kw of generating capacity to its system. At the same time a 6-station 112-mile microwave radio relay system between the Hennepin Station and the Power Company's dispatching center in Decatur, Ill., officially began operation, providing over 1,300 circuit miles for telemetering and remote control, and more than 400 channel miles for voice communication. This radio system is leased by the Power Company from the Illinois Bell Telephone Company which engineered, owns, and maintains it."
"IMPROVEMENT in telephone sets has been responsible for significant advances in the transmission art over the years and has always been an important part of the development program. The recent introduction of an improved telephone set known as the 500-type set has probably had greater effect on the methods of designing exchange cable plant than any other set produced since the early 1920's. Even though improvement had been large in previous sets, transmission was, in general, the controlling factor in the design of subscriber cable and for more than 25 years the general design methods had not been greatly changed. In fact, until very recently, principles in use as early as 19281 were still being applied."
"EXPERIENCE gained by the Signal Corps during World War II and the ensuing experimental period formed the basis for development of the new military 4-channel and 12-channel carrier telephone systems. The heavy, stopgap equipments of World War II while giving reliable service were found to be far from ideal for military use. Experimental work established the considerations which now govern military carrier telephone design."
"A COMPANION paper1 has shown how the trend to high-speed warfare has dictated the expansion and increased flexibility of military carrier telephone networks and how the Signal Corps Engineering Laboratories planned and developed a completely new military communication system based upon experience gained in World War II. This paper describes the work done in connection with one important component of the system, namely, a cable for use with 4-channel and 12-channel carrier telephone equipments. As in the design of other military equipments, the cable design goals stressed advantages in weight, bulk, usable bandwidth, and reliability along with significant improvements in electrical and mechanical characteristics in comparison with the carrier cable of World War II. This World War II cable WC-548 was a rubber insulated and jacketed 4-conductor cable of the star quad type, and it became known as spiral-4."
"EVEN though the over-all system design has been carefully planned and the transmission circuitry has been ably executed, a communications system is only as useful and reliable as it is permitted to be by the actual equipment. Equipment usefulness is dependent on ability to reach its operational site undamaged, adaptability to conditions of usage, competence in operation, and susceptibility to rapid reactivation if disabled. With these requirements in mind, two multichannel carrier telephone systems have been developed for military communication in tactical areas. These are a 4-channel system for operation over distances to a maximum of 100 miles, and a 12-channel system for heavier traffic and longer haul operation over distances to a maximum of 200 miles. The over-all plan, the transmission media, and the transmission characteristics of these systems have been covered in companion papers.1,2 Discussion here will be limited to a description of the actual equipment and its design features as they relate to the basic objectives of durability, transportability, ease of installation, and simplicity of operation, maintenance, and repair under any physical or climatic conditions to be encountered from the arctic to the equator."
"Military communication systems have recently been developed for operation in tactical areas using carrier telephone channels on spiral-4 cable. This is part of an extensive program intended to increase the flexibility of the military communications network. Good transmission performance under all environmental conditions has been stressed. These projects make use of a new type of spiral-4 cable. The cable is to be laid in 1/4-mile lengths with or without loading coils at the junctions. A 4-channel telephone system using the carrier frequency range from 4 to 20 kc has been designed for operation on the loaded cable for distances of 100 miles with repeaters at about 25-mile intervals. A 12-channel telephone system using the carrier frequency range from 12 to 68 kc has also been designed for operation on the nonloaded cable for distances of 200 miles with main repeaters at about 40-mile intervals and with “power-over-the-cable” repeaters at about 6-mile intervals. These new low-loss channels make possible the use of multilink connections and the ultimate establishment of a comprehensive military communication network. The circuits have been developed for great reliability, with simple operating procedures, automatic alarms, good maintenance practices, and great flexibility as to usage."
"MANY items must be studied in designing a new radio set, and a large amount of information and data must be obtained which can therefore be exhibited. However, the practical confines of this paper make it possible to cover only in a general way the major items which may be of interest to other development engineers. Accordingly, this paper will first outline what the new military radio relay equipment does and what it consists of; then briefly describe the circuits of the major units; after which much of the text will cover the important and difficult problems of distortion and noise which so directly affect multichannel systems performance; and will close with a few remarks concerning some of the systems' problems and their solutions. In a companion paper V. I. Cruser1 describes the many equipment features of this radio set."
"This paper discusses some of the unique design features of the terminal required to achieve optimum performance on long-range, high-frequency radio circuits. These features are primarily concerned with the receiving terminal and include diversity combining equipment, subgrouping equipment, and delay measuring and equalizing equipment."
"This paper discusses briefly the technical characteristics of telegraph terminal AN/FGC-29 and the technical requirements that had to be met in its design. The type of construction employed in the equipment is described with the aid of illustrations of a design approval model."
"THIS paper will describe, on a systems basis, a new multichannel teletype terminal which has been designed for the main-line intercontinental radio circuits of the Army Command and Administrative Network (ACAN). This network provides the backbone of the traffic-handling facilities between the United States and major overseas commands largely utilizing single-side-band transmission and reception. The continuity of communications required in this service makes reliability of paramount importance. Therefore, the equipment must be capable of operating effectively under adverse conditions of long-range radio propagation. The heavy traffic load necessary in maintaining the extensive overseas forces imposes the additional major requirement of maximum communication channels per radio circuit. To meet the varied requirements for teletypewriter, voice and facsimile channels, and the rigors of service in poorly controlled environments sometimes necessary in military operations, a basically new multichannel terminal was required for this service. A glance at the older type of terminal equipment shown in Fig. 1, and which currently is in standard use, will quickly show the inadequacies which led to this new design. At the start of World War II, this adaptation of the Western Electric Company type-40C1 voice-frequency carrier telegraph equipment was in use by the Army to provide up to six channels of teletype over a single radio circuit. This system is still in use and employs 2-tone frequency diversity for each channel mark and space. From Fig. 1, at least one major conclusion is apparent: the ten bays of equipment are quite a space outlay for six 60-words-per-minute (wpm) teletype channels. Also, the equipment is by no means adaptable in regard to temperature and humidity. It is essentially commercial-type, fixed plant gear, and must be treated as such if it is to perform properly."
"COMPANION papers1,2 on the AN/TRC-24 radio set have covered the military characteristics and the systems requirements, circuit description, and operating features. The purpose of this paper is to present a mechanical and equipment story which, when added to the electrical features already described, will round out the picture of the entire AN/TRC-24 system."
"PRIOR to World War II, the Armed Forces' need for multitelephone channel trunk circuits was satisfied by the use of metallic wire circuits. Early in the war, it was demonstrated that the fluidity of movement which accompanied blitz-type warfare required a more rapid means of providing multichannel trunk facilities than could be had with wire circuits. As a result, military radio relay equipment operating in the very-high-frequency range was developed early in 1942, capable of providing rapidly installable transmission facilities for four frequency-division multiplexed voice channels. This equipment was used successfully in all theaters of operation throughout World War II, conclusively demonstrating the tactical advantages of this type of transmission facility. In addition, 8-channel microwave equipment, using time-division principles of multiplexing, was developed for use at high echelons of command."
"WHEN AN automatization of the Swedish telephone system came under serious consideration at the beginning of the 1920's, there were available two quite distinct types of selectors. One of these selectors was the L. M. Ericsson machine-driven 500-line selector and the other was the Swedish crossbar selector. Telephone plants under consideration at that time for automatization chiefly comprised large telephone plants in densely built-up areas. It was a difficult matter in those days to make a choice between the two types of selectors. One arrangement which would enable the crossbar selector to compete economically with the 500-line selector for large telephone plants was the employment of marker control. Thus marker systems were proposed as early as the beginning of the 1920's by advocates of the crossbar selector. The Board of Telecommunications, however, decided on several grounds not to adopt such systems at that time. One reason was the possible service risks of common control systems which were not sufficiently eliminated until later. Another reason was that in the 1920's it was not possible to determine the magnitude of the decrease in first cost, plausible in itself, that might be obtained with marker systems. Determination of that point required a mathematical treatment that was not developed until later. The choice was therefore given to the L. M. Ericsson machine-driven 500-line selector for the automatization of the large exchanges in question."
"PERCUSSION welding is not new. Early work goes back beyond the beginning of the century, but little application has been made of it and only a meager amount of literature is available. However, this method has a real field of usefulness as the application described in this paper will show. The original Vang process wherein a capacitor charged to a high potential, often to several thousand volts, is discharged across the gap between parts as they approach each other under a propelling force, is a good general description of the method used. The arc so produced heats the abutting surfaces before they collide so that a very thin layer of metal is brought to welding temperature. The propelling force, while continuing to act, brings the parts together percussively and the weld is made. Little metal is heated and little heat penetrates the adjoining metal; therefore, the heat balance problem is greatly minimized and different metals weld together with little trouble. There is, however, the problem of protecting personnel from high voltage. Also, the two surfaces being welded must be insulated electrically from each other. This excludes the use of this process for joining the ends of the same piece of metal, as in making a ring."
"COLOR television has imposed new requirements on transmission circuits. The nature of the color signal is such that circuits used for its transmission must meet very stringent linearity requirements. The minimizing of differential phase and gain at the color carrier frequency is one of the more important of these new requirements."
"ALTHOUGH magnetic amplifiers have been in use for a great many years, it is only in the past few that they have widespread attention. Their development has been vastly accelerated by the development of high quality core materials and rectifiers, and the recognition of the vital role that rectifiers may play in magnetic-amplifier circuits. Thus the self-saturating magnetic amplifier1,2 incorporating rectifiers in series with the load windings, was invented and was found to have a high gain to time constant ratio."
"IN THE normal process of laying out toll circuits, it is found that many of the circuits will be made up of a combination of open wire and cable facilities. The new short-haul carrier systems will be found on many of the facilities, type-O on open wire1 and type-N on cable.2 Consequently, in built-up circuits, it will frequently be necessary to interconnect O and N carrier facilities at the open wire cable junction. The junctions of open wire and cable will occur most frequently at population centers which serve as terminals for the two facilities. However, there will be numerous cases where the junction will occur at the frontier of the cable expansion program, and may represent a complete change of facility from open wire to cable in the center of a route."
"THE scope of this paper will be limited to the steady-state characteristics of those high-performance magnetic amplifier circuits which are classed as single-phase self-saturated types. No attempt will be made to indicate when considerations presented herein are applicable to the 100-per-cent external feedback type. Only resistive loads will be considered."
"EARLY in 1951, R. A. Ramey prepared a paper1 on magnetic amplifiers. In this and succeeding reports1, 2 on the same subject the theory and application of a new type of half-cycle response magnetic amplifier were developed. This amplifier depended upon square hysteresis loop magnetic materials for its proper operation, and the analysis in turn postulated square-loop materials."
"ONE OF the important factors in the design and maintenance of television transmission circuits is random interference, sometimes referred to as random noise. Much of this type of interference originates in the input stages of amplifiers but it may also originate in the line or in other parts of the transmission path. These noise components are greatly modified by circuit equalization which may vary from a few decibels (db) to possibly 27 or more db per octave. Thus the transmission engineer is confronted with the problem of evaluating random interference having different energy levels, per cycle, over the television bandwidth. Before noise evaluations can be made, information must be obtained by subjective tests on the interfering effect of broad, narrow, and mixed bands of random noise distributed throughout the television band."
"FOR MANY years the use of magnetic amplifiers was confined to those applications where extreme reliability was required, but where speed of response was not particularly important. Under the pressure of greater reliability and weight-saving requirements in higher power installations, important advances have been made in magnetic amplifier circuitry and components to achieve higher gain-to-time-constant ratios. It was not until the work of R. A. Ramey,1 however, that attention was focussed on the fact that magnetic amplifiers could be made with extremely fast response (i.e., one-half cycle of the power frequency) more or less independently of the power gain."
"THE SYNCHRO magnetic amplifier was developed at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), to eliminate some of the difficulties and failures of the electronic synchro amplifier. At the same time, it provides a demonstration of a system utilizing magnetic circuits of a type which was developed at the Laboratory.1, 2, 3"
"THE type-N carrier system1 was introduced into the field 3 years ago to satisfy the increasing demand for short-haul toll telephone trunks. The system provides flat regulation for the group of 12 channels at each repeater and the receiving terminal. Individual channel regulation is provided only at the receiving terminal. The flat group regulation is adequate for longer systems, but for system lengths greater than about 150 miles, the transmission variation caused by temperature change could exceed the individual channel regulating ability of the receiving terminal. If this were to occur, the channels would not meet the severe standards specified for them as a component of a multilink toll connection."
"THE liberal use of vacuum tubes in toll transmission equipment, the miniaturization of this and other component apparatus, and the assembly of the components into cubic units rather than on flat panels, for the purpose of realizing the potential space saving, has presented a new problem in heat dissipation. The necessity of designing for safe heat disposal has long been recognized in radio transmitters and similar high-power equipment. Now it is apparent in low-power equipment as well."
"This paper illustrates the computation of steady temperature fields in electrical coils by the numerical-relaxation method of Emmons and Southwell. The general numerical method is briefly reviewed, and several examples serve to exemplify the simplicity of the technique and to verify that numerical temperatures are in substantial agreement with both experimental data and exact analytical values."
"This article is a general survey of recent development work on sources of unipolar air using alpha-emitting radioactive materials. Specific reference is made to a new device, operating at relatively high air speeds of about 450 feet per minute, which will provide an air output containing only positive or only negative ions. The method of controlling the density of this unipolar output is also treated."
"THE OBJECT of this paper is to evaluate quantitatively the termination of inert gas-filled power tubes by contact pins and sockets and by flexible leads with pressure-type terminals."
"IN THE wilderness of the Quebec Labrador boundary a new Canadian industry is being established 360 miles from the nearest permanent settlement. This industry is the mining of iron ore and the location is Knob Lake, 360 miles almost due north of the small town of Seven Islands on the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence."
"THE transmission of program material over a nation-wide system of wire-line networks interconnecting most of the country's broadcast and television stations has grown apace with the development of the radio and television arts. Today, program networks aggregating as much as 156,000 miles in length, including both radio broadcast circuits and television sound channels, may be employed during a single evening."
"THE Oil and Gas Division of the Department of the Interior requested the National Petroleum Council to appoint a committee to make a study and report on the radio and radar usage being made by the petroleum industry. This paper is based on the report prepared by the committee, under the chairmanship of F. W. Littell."
"THE Santa Fe railroad has installed a microwave system between Galveston and Beaumont, Texas. The installation is being used to supplement existing wire-line communication and to obtain technical information regarding the operation and reliability of a microwave radio-relay system in this area. It was felt at the time the decision was made to install the system that, if microwave radio relay could be made to operate reliably in this area, it could be made to provide reliable service on other parts of the railroad where the terrain and atmospheric conditions would be more favorable to its use."
"A miniaturized compandor has been developed for widespread application to open-wire, cable, and radio channels. Self-contained plug-in units can be inserted in telephone circuits at all commonly expected transmission levels. Two-wire operation is achieved with a plug-in resistance hybrid. Equipment simplification is achieved through use of only two miniature vacuum tubes. A conventional approach has been followed to obtain a compandor circuit with a two-to-one compression and expansion characteristic. Straightforward empirical methods are used to achieve the desired results. Reduction of noise and crosstalk, commonly stated as 22 decibels (db), actually varies considerably, depending on the type and magnitude of interference."
"A GENERAL second-order ordinary differential equation occurring frequently in engineering analysis is ${d \\over dx} \\left [ f(x){d \\phi \\over dx} \\right ]+ \\lambda g(x) \\phi = 0 \\eqno{\\hbox{(1)}}$ in which λ is a constant and f and g are arbitrary functions such that a finite solution exists in the interval of interest. It is the purpose of this paper to show how solutions satisfying this equation and various boundary conditions can be obtained by means of a simple d-c network analyzer. For such an equation, there exist only certain values of the parameter λ, the eigenvalues, which permit the solution to satisfy the boundary conditions. The first problem, then, is to determine one or more of these eigenvalues, whereupon the corresponding solutions can be obtained. This procedure presents considerable difficulty, and analytical solutions are available only for a few special cases."
"THIS investigation is primarily concerned with the solution of boundary-value problems by means of automatic computing equipment. Specifically, it is concerned with the solution of ordinary differential equations in which certain conditions (boundary values) are specified at two or more values of the independent variable. Such problems are generally called boundary-value problems; however, it must be emphasized that this report is restricted to the solution of ordinary differential equations, and not to the solution of partial differential equations."
"A nondestructive method for sensing the information state of magnetic-memory cores is under development. This new method involves the use of a quadrature magnetic field which, when pulsed, produces an output voltage. The polarity of the output voltage contains the information: a positive output pulse represents a one, and a negative pulse a zero. Reading in this manner can be repeated indefinitely without destroying the information held by the core. The method has proven to be exceedingly fast, giving output pulses of 0.2 microsecond in duration, and because of the rapid flux change when sensing, the output voltage has been observed in excess of 1 volt per turn."
"THE TYPE-7 crossbar selector is a mechanism for selecting one of several trunk groups in a dial telephone switching system. Each of these trunk groups may lead to a subsequent rank of group selectors, to connectors (final selectors), to outgoing trunks, or to one of several special services. Switching in this case is based on a system of decimal numbering; consequently the selector, in response to a single pull or digit of a telephone dial-calling device, provides a choice of one trunk group out of 10. The selector consists of a group of relays, a magnetic impulse counter to register the digit, and certain permanently associated portions of several crossbar switches. Generally, each selector has access to 100 outlets, which are arranged in 10 groups of 10 paths each."
"THE diode matrix is usually thought of as a component in electronic circuits using diodes of small physical size and having current-carrying capacity in microamperes. This paper describes an application of the diode matrix in a relay switching circuit, where the diodes are small selenium rectifiers with current-carrying capacity sufficient to operate relays. In this application an effort was made to use commercially available selenium-rectifier units for economy in purchasing the small quantity involved."
"IN APRIL 1952, the Federal Communications Commission released its final report and order in television (TV) allocation proceedings which had been instituted in May 1948. In the intervening 4-year period, almost every shred of engineering information and evidence relative to the TV broadcasting service problem was examined and further explored by the industry itself and by working committees composed of industry and government members. This was, in part, the period of the famous, or infamous, TV “freeze” during which public clamor for TV service was at times reflected in Congressional rumblings. An examination of the data used by these engineers, and a study of the hypotheses wrought, yields an insight to the TV service standards of today as they are being applied in the development of TV broadcasting in the United States. We are now just entering upon the proof-of-performance phase for these standards. From the five stations operating before and during World War II, through the artificial period when the number of TV stations hovered around the 100 mark during the freeze period, we have emerged during the past year to a point when the number of stations operating has reached approximately 200, the total number of stations authorized has reached approximately 500, and the present channel assignment table of the Federal Communications Commission provides for 2,000 stations in 1,285 cities and towns."
"PRACTICALLY all of the telephone switching equipment in an exchange is made up of wired assemblies - assemblies of relays and other components interconnected by a multiplicity of wires. These assemblies are on frameworks generally 11 feet 6 inches high. Many of these frameworks are made up of smaller components called relay circuit units composed mainly of relays. Rotary switches, resistors, capacitors, jacks, etc., necessary for the operation of switching circuits may also be included. These components vary in height up to about 24 inches and after testing they are mounted in the larger frameworks. A careful check of connections and electrical continuity is essential to assure that these units will function properly when connected to other circuits in a telephone exchange."
"THE determination of fluid-flow and pressure drop in complicated pipe networks such as gas or water distribution systems presents many problems similar to those encountered by the electrical engineer in the study of transmission and distribution networks. As the network analyzer has proved to be a very great help to the electrical engineer in his studies, it seems reasonable that similar techniques utilizing similar analyzers would be of considerable value in the analysis of pipe networks. Several investigators have reported methods for applying network analyzer techniques to gas or water distribution problems, some using special handling of conventional analyzers and others using special analyzers built solely for fluid-flow problems."
"The general equation of heat conduction for a wire heated by an electric current and contained in an insulating cartridge filled with powder cannot be solved by analytical methods. In this paper, two approximate solutions are obtained; the first, obtained by an analytical method, assumes that radial heat loss from the wire is negligible; the second assumes that the parameters of the wire, filler, and cartridge remain constant at some average value, so that the equation can be solved by an analogue method. The analogue is described and the results obtained are checked against those calculated by assuming no radial heat loss, the circuit of the analogue being modified to eliminate the elements representing that loss. The magnitudes of the various errors associated with the analogue are determined as far as possible. The range of fusing current over which the analytical solution with no radial heat loss gives a good approximation to the correct temperature distribution is examined, and found to cover most of the region which is important in fuse operation. The temperature distributions obtained are used to determine the distribution of axial and radial losses along the length of a particular wire. From this the variation of losses with fusing current is obtained, and the range of current over which heat losses are negligible is determined."

"The flow of energy is traced in a typical, somewhat idealized 3-phase alternator, using an adaptation of Poynting's vector together with a discussion of this procedure. Following the specification of the electromagnetic field, quantitative analysis of the flow of energy in the gap, at the surface of the rotor, and into and out of the stator conductors is presented under no load, at a unity-power-factor load and then for any power-factor load. Qualitative description of the flow of energy in the intermediate regions and to the output terminals of the machine is then given, together with a brief discussion of the extension of this analysis to other machines and to less idealized situations."
"Recent commercial and military printing telegraph communication requirements could not be fully met in an efficient and economical manner with existing equipment. This paper describes the objectives being reached in the development of a new integrated line of Teletype apparatus especially designed to adequately serve present and future printing telegraph applications and particularly covers the Teletype Model 28 Direct Keyboard Page Printer Set, Fig. 1. This set consists of a page typing unit, keyboard, electrical service unit, and their motor drive and cabinet housing. The other units which will soon be available are the tape perforator, tape typing unit, and transmitter distributor, which with the keyboard and page typing unit are so designed as to be readily arranged in many combinations to meet specific applications. Fig. 2 indicates the basic units and a few representative combinations."
"Results of wind tunnel tests on an experimental radar antenna are discussed. The torque required to rotate the antenna was seen to vary with the azimuth position, the elevation angle, the pivot location, the rotating speed, and the wind velocity. A correlation of the data based on dimensionless parameters was found."
"A new, miniaturized, 12-channel open-wire carrier system, the Lenkurt 45A system, is described. For use in the 40-to 150-kc frequency region, it co-ordinates fully in level and frequency allocations with present Lenkurt 42C and Western Electric J carrier systems using this frequency space. Because of the inclusion of 2-pilot regulation for flat and slope gain control, supplemented by channel regulation with a range of about ± 7 decibels (db), more stable circuit operation is obtained than in previous open-wire carrier systems. The design which results is much reduced in cost as compared to past systems in this frequency range, and affords an opportunity for considerable expansion in use of open-wire plant above the 35-kc range. This use is further enhanced by optionally supplied compandors, permitting many instances of use of wire lines transposed only for 35-kc operation. An important feature of the system is terminal design and frequency allocation co-ordinated for open-wire, single cable, and radio use. This permits great flexibility in interconnecting among such systems without need for intervening terminals. Miniaturization carried to a high degree results in a terminal occupying but 31 1/2 inches of vertical space on a telephone-type relay rack. Back-to-back operation permits as many as 96 channels in two 11-foot 6-inch bays. Extensive use is made of standardized plug-in units further supplemented by plug-in band filters and signaling options, to fit a wide variety of application requirements."
"THE United States Army Signal Corps has recently added another chapter to the colorful history of military communications. On Dec. 17, 1952 at Fifth Army Headquarters, Chicago, Ill., the Signal Corps placed in service its new teletypewriter switching center which automatically switches messages through the Army's vast world-wide teletypewriter network. Sufficient time has passed since the system was cut into service to provide adequate demonstration that the system is an important link in modern military communications. Behind the drama of the cutover to the new system lies a story of technical progress which has kept the Signal Corps abreast of the most modern developments in communications technique. Some of the many technical and operational problems encountered in the development of this highly complex system will be told here."
"THE increasing number of electronic applications for semiconducting materials which have been developed in recent years, coupled with the discovery of the transistor action of these materials, has been largely responsible for the vast amount of research data which have been published on semiconductors. Most of the work has been done on germanium and silicon and as a result these data have led to a better understanding of the mechanism of electric conduction in semiconductors as well as an explanation of their rectification properties. Data such as these are lacking for selenium. The development of the selenium rectifier industry, however, during the past decade has stimulated an interest in its semiconducting properties. A limited amount of research work has been done on both single crystal and microcrystalline selenium, thinking that perhaps such data would aid in understanding the mechanism of conduction and also aid in overcoming some of the difficulties encountered in the manufacture of rectifiers. Several researchers have studied the electrical properties of single crystals of selenium with the thought that such data would serve to explain the electrical properties of microcrystalline selenium. These data have not materially clarified the situation. In view of these facts, and also since selenium exists in the microcrystalline state in selenium rectifiers, it would seem that measurements on the electrical properties of microcrystalline material would be the most practical contribution to existing data."
"IN POWER applications of selenium rectifiers the reverse characteristics of the selenium cell are of interest only in so far as they affect the heat generated within the cell and thus the efficiency and the current rating of the cell as dictated by its heat-dissipation capabilities. In more critical applications, however, the detailed reverse characteristics of the cell must be considered; this is particularly true in the case of selenium cells used as self-saturating or feedback rectifiers of magnetic amplifiers. In such applications, not only a more complete knowledge of the reverse resistive properties of the cell is required but also information regarding its capacitive properties."
"THIS bibliography contains 330 titles and abstracts on publications applicable to the fields of data storage, recording, analogue-to-digital conversion, data presentation, and telemetering."
"THE provision of good telegraph service requires that the circuits be designed, engineered, and maintained so as to afford good transmission quality. The measurement of a single quantity, known as telegraph distortion,1 at the receiving end is sufficient to establish the transmission quality since it contains all signal degrading effects, such as interference, poor relay performance, and wave-shape distortion. Therefore, the ability to measure distortion conveniently and accurately is of prime importance."
"THERE are many engineering problems in the field of electronics which require a good method of transmitting radio frequency energy from a fixed unit to a rotating unit. For radio frequencies at which wave guides are normally employed, the rotary joint herewith described is especially suitable, particularly where there is a multiplicity of independent transmission lines involved in a relative motion; for example, in a radar or radio communications system where a combination of fixed and rotary transmission lines must be connected together."
"THE use of tungsten wire for the sensing element of a resistance thermometer is not new to the art. However, to the best knowledge of the authors, this thermometer, Fig. 1, is the first successful one with stabilities as good as, or better than, platinum."
"AMPLIFIERS for use in automatic control systems should feature high gain, high-power output, and fast response along with light weight and reliable operation. In electrical systems magnetic amplifiers are gaining favor because of their rugged construction, but until recently the response time of magnetic amplifiers has been relatively unsatisfactory for small servo systems. Amplifiers are often characterized by a time constant, but for carrier devices the number of cycles for 100 per cent response is sometimes a preferable characterization. In an elementary carrier type amplifier 100 per cent response can be obtained in 1/2 to 3/2 cycles depending on the time within the cycle at which the input change is applied. Gas tubes, for instance, achieve this result. This general behavior is often spoken of as single-cycle or half-cycle response. In this paper fast-response magnetic amplifiers are considered to be those which respond fully to an input change within 2 cycles of the carrier frequency."
"A NEW line of carrier equipment known as the class 45 has been developed with a view toward application on open-wire lines, paired and coaxial cable, and radio systems. Both mechanical and electrical design have been co-ordinated for each of the systems in these respective applications. In this paper, the 45A system arrangements for open-wire use are described. In basic terminal equipment, no differences exist for the various applications. Substitution of a small number of common group-modulating assemblies, modifications in slight degree in carrier supply, and rearrangements of terminal frame assemblies identify specific uses. Great stress has been placed on standardization in this respect, both to speed the development in the different areas of ultimate use and also to increase the demand for specific items of manufacture. With the major part of this equipment alike among these different systems, and differences introduced by the relatively small number of group-identifying parts, it has been possible to come out almost simultaneously with manufactured terminal arrangements for most of the fields of application. Transmission features and electric performance of the equipment are described in a companion paper by Appert, Caruthers, and Chaskin.1"
"IN a previous paper1 it was shown how expressions for vector potential could be derived from corresponding values of scalar potential for a point source; these expressions are given in the author's Tables of Green's Functions.2 It was then shown how these vector-potential expressions could be used to derive the fields due to uniformly magnetized disks, or due to coils, building them up from magnetic doublets or individual current elements by integration. The examples given in that paper1 were limited to those in which the field did not vary with time, since some additional concepts need to be introduced when the field varies with time. These will be considered here, and examples given of the field due to conductors or coils in which the current varies with time."
"THE constant striving of the Signal Corps Engineering Laboratories and the foresight and ingenuity of an enterprising laboratory have produced a teletypewriter capable of 60 to 100 word-per-minute operation, suitable for the armed forces. This paper outlines the development; discusses the features making this equipment unique and acceptable to the armed forces; and shows the complete line of equipment as used in an integrated communication system."
"This paper presents a general mathematical technique for studying the response of linear time-varying circuits that contain parameters whose magnitudes vary in a periodic manner with the time. The method presented is based on the Brillouin-Wentzel-Kramers (BWK) procedure, which has been widely used in connection with problems of wave mechanics. This method gives approximate results with very little error if the variable circuit elements exhibit small variations about a large average value. The application of the method to circuit problems is illustrated by using it to study the free and forced oscillations of typical series circuits that contain periodic capacitance, resistance, and inductance parameters."
"IN many engineering structures one is confronted with the problem of eddy-current losses in conducting solids due to nearby alternating currents. In electric machines such as motors, generators, and transformers, the machine parts exposed to variable fields are made up of laminations so as to break up the eddy-current paths and avoid losses. Yet, in parts of these machines, solid metallic structures do occur which are exposed to alternating fields and which it is impossible to laminate. Among these are end plates of rotors and stators in the field of the end turns, and transformer tanks in the field of current leads. Similarly, in buildings of reinforced steel construction, heavy current leads may cause eddy-current losses in the steel girders. Finally, eddy currents may be excited in sea water or in the earth, either under conditions of zero-phase short-circuit currents in power lines or when alternating currents are provided with ground leads. In problems of interference between power and telephone lines, the distribution of eddy currents and their effect on the interference factors are of interest."
"The physical properties of polyethylene are such as to make it attractive for many wire-insulating applications, particularly in multiconductor communications cables. This article presents certain factual information relating to new types of multiconductor cables having extruded polyethylene insulation, and describes briefly their initial installation in the working telephone plant. The literature is replete with information on the physical and chemical properties and the behavior of polyethylene, and so no attempt is made to explore the quality of the material per se. Polyethylene insulation extruded in the form of both solid material and foam to impart certain desired electrical properties is discussed. In a broad sense, this article may be considered as announcing an important new insulating material for telephone cables, which may be expected eventually to have very extensive applications in the Bell System plant."
"EXPERIMENTAL data are presented on the rate of change of flux in four materials used in magnetic amplifiers. A test circuit which applied a constant magnetizing force to a test core was employed.1 The rate of change of flux was then observed as the induced voltage in a pickup coil. By observing the induced voltage wave on an oscilloscope, one can determine the peak and average rate of change of flux, along with the wave shape as a function of time. This information is helpful in understanding and improving the performance of magnetic amplifiers, as will be discussed later."
"IN THE search for a higher power transmitting tube for the frequency range of 470 to 890 megacycles (mc), it rapidly became evident that only a tube using transit time advantageously could solve the problem. In any discussion of an ultrahigh-frequency (uhf) transmitter employing a klystron power amplifier, a basic knowledge of klystrons is essential."
"A fundamental limitation on the steady-state signal frequency response of a series-resonant dielectric voltage amplifier is the time required for the resonant circuit to adjust to a change in tuning. This paper analyzes this limitation for the case where nonlinear resonance effects may be neglected. Typically, this limitation may require that the power or carrier frequency be several hundred times the highest signal frequency, if the gain of the amplifier is to be constant."
"A FUNDAMENTALLY new system of precipitator automatic voltage control has been developed for use in the Cottrell process of electrically removing suspended matter from gases. The new system is based on extensive field measurements with respect to the actual operating requirements necessary to obtain fundamentally sound performance. This, coupled with flexibility in design, ensures that optimum electrical conditions for maximum collection efficiency will be maintained automatically and continuously for a wide range of precipitator conditions."
"RURAL Radio Network, Ithaca, N.Y., operates a chain of 13 frequency-modulation (FM) stations on a radio relay basis. Six of these stations are owned and operated by this network. In common with most FM broadcast stations, the transmitters are located in mountainous terrain with relatively poor access, especially in the winter season."
"An a-c phase-sensitive signal generator for use in servo and instrumentation work is described. The voltage gradient and zero position are independent of linear rotor motions, and the torque and magnetic side pull on the rotor are extremely small."
"IN designing any high-frequency device which is to have relatively uniform characteristics over a band of frequencies, one of the prime considerations for easing the severity of design compromises is to choose a basic configuration inherently suited to maintaining the reactive energies of the system low compared with the energy flow per cycle through the device. Such a smooth flow through the system can be approached by maintaining the impedances throughout the system resistive over the desired performance frequency band. This in turn dictates the avoidance of resonant components since such resonant elements tend to introduce high reactance slopes into the system impedances requiring careful compensation in the design. The case of the uniform transmission line with distributed constants properly arranged so as to minimize reflections is perhaps the ideal example of such a system."
"The basic operating principles and design data for an instrument to measure metal thickness or plating depth for nonferrous materials are described. The mode of operation, involving the measurement of a phase angle, permits the use of a noncontacting probe suitable for the continuous inspection of samples in motion."
"IN the design of switching circuits based on relay-contact networks, it is known that if the function which describes the network is of the symmetric type it leads to a network which is much more economical of switching elements than the best series-parallel circuit. C. E. Shannon1 first described this type of function and its associated relay contact network in 1938. His definition of the symmetric function was general, but most of the generality of concept has been lost in subsequent treatment of the subject. For example, S. H. Washburn2 defines the symmetric relay-contact network as “one in which the conditions for closing a particular input-to-output path are given & in terms of the number of relays operated and un-operated.” This particular type of network is derived from a restricted class of symmetric functions - a class of functions which may be realized by means of iterative networks.3 There is a much larger class of symmetric functions contained within Shannon's definition, and these can be realized only by means of non-iterative networks."
"A photographic technique was used to measure ionization under impulse voltage in transformer mineral oil and in transformer Askarel (a chlorohydrocarbon). Two electric-field conditions were investigated: 1. The liquid under test surrounded disk electrodes between which were placed impregnated pressboard and dried photographic paper. Above a threshold voltage, Lichtenberg figures occurred in the thin film of liquid under the rounded electrode edge. For mineral-oil immersant, the figures were independent of voltage polarity, while for Askarel immersant, the figures depended markedly on voltage polarity. The chlorine atoms in the Askarel and in carbon tetrachloride are shown to affect the liquid-ionization process and the puncture voltage of Askarel-impregnated pressboard. Chopped-wave tests demonstrate how the discharges develop with time. 2. The pressboard was replaced by a polystyrene sheet and the upper electrode was raised above the sheet to permit the liquid to fill the intervening space. Ionization records were obtained on the photographic paper at threshold stresses which, in most cases, were lower than either the breakdown stress with the polystyrene barrier present or the breakdown stress of the oil without the barrier. The threshold impulse-ionization stress was the same when the photographic paper was under the transparent barrier and not in contact with the stressed oil layer. Threshold-ionization stresses ranged from 400 to 800 kv per centimeter in virtually uniform fields."
"The effect of corona on the long-time dielectric strength of insulation is emphasized in this paper, and various factors influencing the breakdown of insulation with corona are discussed. Data on the corona threshold voltages on dielectric surfaces at electrode edges show that the threshold voltage varies for a wide variety of dielectrics only as the ratio of dielectric thickness to dielectric constant."
"AS the technology of engineering progresses a point is sometimes reached where, by the expansion and generalization of certain basic concepts, two or more seemingly unrelated areas of study can be brought together and shown to have a common origin. The common origins are very important to those in the teaching profession, where the rapid expansion of the engineering profession demands that an ever-increasing amount of technical understanding be developed in the student with little or no increase in student contact time. Without these common origins, the necessary increase in teaching efficiency would be difficult to attain. One of the purposes of this, the companion paper,1 and a conference paper, \"General Network Theory in Terms of Matrix Algebra\" by M. B. Reed, is to show that by expanding our general network theory and concepts as we now think of them, and by taking a slightly different and more general viewpoint toward the rotating machinery problem, these two areas of technology can be built on a common and rigorous foundation which results in a clearer and broader understanding of both areas, and at the same time will perhaps provide for a more efficient teaching program."
"The procedure used in arriving at the differential equations of the commutating machine is identical to that used on the noncommutating machines discussed in reference 1. However, the techniques used in processing the resulting equations is somewhat different. In the study of commutating machines, two problems are of interest: 1. How can the machine be analyzed along with its associated network to determine the external characteristics? 2. Will the machine commutate satisfactorily under the conditions of operation?"
"Test methods for evaluating the stability of high-temperature magnet-wire insulation are described. Reduction in dielectric strength during uninterrupted exposure to high temperature is used to define the insulation life which would be obtained with comparatively ideal operating conditions. Moisture resistance, as measured by power factor after humidification, is proposed as a criterion for determining the ability of a material to withstand such adverse operating hazards as moisture absorption or mechanical shock. Results have been obtained which indicate that deterioration rates, calculated from measured reduction in dielectric properties at high temperatures, may be experimentally verified at lower temperatures. When this is true, justification is provided for the extrapolation of data to lower, operating temperatures. Conversely, the absence of similar aging trends at different, accelerated temperatures should serve notice that care must be taken in the extrapolation of data to low temperatures."
"A REVIEW of the literature concerned with magnetic amplifiers has disclosed a myriad of articles dealing with the load circuit and sometimes control circuit response of single-core amplifiers employing the self-saturation principle.1‾4 Each of these discussions has utilized specific assumptions which are in each case aimed toward an ultimate simplification of the mathematical manipulations which finally lead to the required response. In many cases the predicted magnetic amplifier response suffers because of the assumptions thus used."
"DIGITAL and analogue computers are being recognized gradually as aids in design procedures applied to machines. Recently the Motor Network Calculator (MONECA), an analogue computer for single phase motor design, was described.1, 2 In addition there have been other references describing the use of network and differential analyzers to solve some problems touching on machine design. Thus far there has been very little reference in the literature directly pertaining to the use of digital computers in the machine design function. The purpose of this paper is to attempt to show that under some circumstances the digital computer has a definite place in the design procedure and to attempt to stimulate the use of this valuable tool for design activities."
"Based on chemical reaction rate theory and an extension of the application of the Arrhenius equation, a method is presented for calculating insulation degradation curves. Using the initial dielectric strength (DS) and time-temperature insulation characteristic to deteriorate to some given percentage level, curves showing the relationship between DS and insulation aging at a constant temperature may be computed. Also degradation curves to other given percentage levels of initial DS may be derived. Thus data may be converted into forms more valuable to the design engineer."
"ONE OF the most difficult problems encountered in the application of power rectifiers is the calculation of arc-back currents. Arc back is the term which refers to conduction of current through the rectifier in the reverse direction, i.e., from cathode to anode. It provides, simultaneously, a short circuit on the rectifier transformer low-voltage winding and paths for the flow of direct current from the d-c bus. Consequently, arc-back currents are nearly always higher than currents resulting from a 3-phase short circuit on the rectifier transformer. Knowledge of the magnitude of arc-back current is important because the resulting stresses may damage the rectifier or associated transformer and switchgear.1‾3 The magnitude of arc-back current can be obtained from the curves presented in this paper without restoring to the use of complicated mathematics. In addition, the curves provide a way to evaluate readily the effect of a change in circuit constants, a consideration which is important when reactors must be installed to limit stresses on the equipment."
"THE Rural Electrification Administration (REA) under an Act of Congress of October 1949 has the responsibility for making long-term loans for the construction of telephone systems in predominantly rural areas. Loans made under the Act are generally for a 35-year period at 2-per-cent interest."
"SINCE the first successful community television system was installed in May 1950 at Lansford, Pa., this infant industry had made a great advance. At present there are some 240 systems providing television reception to a potential audience of several hundred thousand people throughout the country."
"AN improved magnetic servo amplifier utilizing half-wave bridges in cascade has been extensively used in instrument-type servos designed at the U.S. Naval Ordnance Laboratory. The speed of response inherent in a magnetic amplifier of this type has made possible the application of conventional compensation and stabilization techniques.1 The result is dynamic servo performance characteristics far exceeding those of previous magnetic-amplifier servo systems employing magnetic amplifiers using full-wave circuitry."
"INTEREST in eddy currents in solid iron masses has kept pace with the development of electromagnetic devices generally.1 The first problems arose in the design of eddy-current brakes for flywheels. Then the use of iron wires for telephone lines and iron rails for the supply of power to a-c locomotives led to new problems. It was recognized that the saturation of the iron was an important factor, and many authors have presented their theories to take saturation into account. Following the appearance of Rosenberg's work,2 others3‾6 have made an academic problem of substantiating it or elaborating upon it. Recently the damping effect of eddy currents in the solid yokes and pole pieces of d-c machines has become important. Still more recently, it has been recognized that the saturation effect is important in computing the core losses in thin steel or alloy sheets."
"THE purpose of this paper is twofold: to advance an integrated account of the basic theory underlying the performance of the iron-cored a-c galvanometer when used as a null detector in an a-c bridge and to advance experimental verification of this theory."
"THE measurement of currents at the higher frequencies is complicated by the ever-magnified inductances and capacitances associated with the measuring equipment. On direct currents, permanent-magnet moving coil instruments are used extensively, and here the main consideration is the series resistance of the instrument. Instruments for lower frequency alternating currents generally make use of the electrodynamic or some form of moving iron measuring system. Here again the series resistance of the instrument is important but, in addition, the series inductance of the necessary coils becomes a factor. As the frequency is increased the effects of the inductance also increase, and in the middle audio-frequencies these effects become formidable."
"DEMAND for stable amplifiers to work at extremely low signal levels has attracted the attention of all who design and build amplifiers. The pulse relaxation amplifier (pra) is an outgrowth of this demand. It is essentially a magnetic amplifier requiring no rectifiers and operating from a pulse power supply. Preliminary tests indicate a zero drift level of less than 10-16 watt over a temperature range from -70 to 140 degrees centigrade. This is compared to 10-8 watt attainable with conventional amplistats (self-saturating magnetic amplifiers). They are temperature-limited primarily because of their rectifiers. The two greatest sources of drift in amplistats, variation in rectifier and magnetic-core characteristics, have been eliminated in the pra."
"THIS paper is a discussion of the problems concerned with co-ordinating microwave systems in the various safety and special services to obtain maximum utilization of the microwave spectrum consistent with the economical and technical factors of system usage by present and potential users."
"The digital data-recorder stores in digital form continuous voltages from various transducers. It records for 8 minutes with 0.5-per-cent precision one channel of 1,600-cycle bandwidth and eight channels of 200-cycle bandwidth each. The design provides for additional amplitude-modulated (a-m) channels, with a bandwidth up to 80 kc if the operating time is reduced. The volume specification for the recorder is 500 cubic inches. Because of the digital representation of the data, more information can be stored in the limited space, the data can be reduced automatically, and calibration is simplified. While this paper gives block diagrams and wave forms for a specific application, the results are applicable for many instrumentation systems."
"A series of equivalent circuits are established for the partial differential equations representing the diffusion of neutrons in a reactor. One-, two-, and three-dimensional spatial models, valid for all curvilinear orthogonal reference frames, are given first for monoenergetic neutrons. The presence of variable-energy neutrons is represented next by the appearance of a fourth dimension. Variation of neutron density in time is also considered along an extra fifth dimension. Circuit models with arbitrary shapes and with tens of thousands of net points may now be solved quickly and efficiently with the aid of digital computers by the recently developed tensorial method of tearing the model apart into smaller parts and solving each part separately. The effect of movable and variable control fixtures in the reactor, also a variation in composition, may now be considered without repeating the solutions arrived at for the rest of the reactor."
"THE advantages of half-wave magnetic-amplifier circuits of the flux reset type have been described in several papers.1,2 However, when several such amplifiers are cascaded and the output is used to drive a servomotor, the output often is allowed to be a half-wave.3 This sort of output has proved satisfactory for either d-c motors or 2-phase a-c motors if a small derating of the motor output is accepted."
"The operation of magnetic amplifiers with sensitive core materials is characterized by time intervals in the cycle during which the voltage of the a-c power source is balanced (or \"absorbed\") almost entirely by the rates of change of core fluxes, and by other intervals in which the core fluxes are nearly constant and the voltage of the power source substantially appears applied to the load."
"THE companion paper (part I)1 has supplied expressions for output currents and for currents in the load in terms of the angle of firing α taken as the independent variable. The treatment has been developed with reference to practical situations of magnetic amplifier circuitry, but substantially no need was felt for a close understanding of the phenomena taking place in the amplifier proper."
"THE analysis and synthesis of 2-terminal combinational networks from the standpoint of truth tables and Boolean algebra have been treated in great detail.1,2 In this paper these networks will be considered from a somewhat different viewpoint, mainly a switching function will be considered as a set of Vertexes on an n-dimensional cube (n-cube). Once a correspondence between a switching function and a set of Vertexes on an n-cube is found, the concept of a “distance” may then be introduced. This concept proves to be of value in the problems of discovering symmetries and of classifying types of switching functions."
"SINCE the advent of the varistor modulator in carrier communication equipment about 20 years ago, much has been written on the theoretical nature of the modulation processes involved. Very little has been written with regard to the practical problems in modulator use encountered by the designer. This paper will stress the practical rather than the theoretical."
"THE Engineer Research and Development Laboratories (ERDL), Fort Belvoir, Va., have encountered, in connection with investigations into the effect of electrical component characteristics on the performance of various army equipment, a requirement for information on the electrical properties of low-loss core materials at low flux densities."
"MOBILE radio equipment manufactured in the period from 1946 to 1950 was designed for a 120-kc channel allocation in the 40-megacycle (mc) band. The receivers used with these systems had poor selectivity characteristics by today's standards and are now referred to as “extra-wide-band” receivers. As mobile radio service expanded and the demand for frequency allocations increased, the inefficiency of this bandwidth assignment became evident. Accordingly the channel allocation was reduced to 40 kc, thus tripling the available number of frequency assignments. Initially, the Federal Communications Commission made assignments on an alternate-channel basis so as to allow 80-kc frequency spread between stations in the same geographical area. However, by 1951 most manufacturers were supplying equipment capable of working in a 40-kc channel assignment without being affected by systems on adjacent channels. Currently, receiver design has progressed to the point where 20-kc channel allocations, split-channel operation, appear to be feasible, and units of this type have been manufactured and placed in service."
"ONE of the important operating problems of the central station engineer is to analyze system faults, to find out what the faults were and how well the protective equipment functioned to clear them. These faults may occur anywhere on the system and at any time during the day or night. They may last only a fraction of a second, and the most important part may last less than 1/2 cycle or less than 1/120 second."
"A practical illustration of the versatility obtainable in applying modern types of carrier telephone systems to radio facilities is given in an application of 48 channels of the Western Electric Company type-N1 carrier to a 2-section radio system in an area served by The Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company. The radio system, with the unusual feature of combining two types of radio equipments, has a Western Electric Company type-TD-2 terminal at Los Angeles and type-TE-1 terminal near Ventura, with one intermediate TD-2 repeater at Oat Mountain, near Chatsworth, California."
"THE existence of two identical over-water radio links, one in the 250-and one in the 450-megacycle (mc) range, provided an opportunity for comparative studies of propagation in the two frequency bands. In making the studies, received signal strengths were recorded and shown as: 1. signal strength as a percentage of time, and 2. as signal strength probability. Observed signal strengths were compared to calculations made on the basis of previously published theoretical data."
"THE instrumentation described in this paper is based upon the variation of mutual inductance between two coils when brought near a metal surface. A type of thickness gauge employing this principle was first publicized by M. L. Greenough1‾4; he stated that the signal obtained from a mutual inductance was ‾greater and more linear” than from self-inductance. Since then applications of the principle have been extended to the measurement of distance and vibration."
"THE authors' company is engaged in common carrier communications service in Southern California. One of the many services offered by the company is the provision of video transmission facilities between any points specified within the area. Permanent transmission facilities have been provided over principal demand (backbone) routes and portable microwave relay systems interconnect branch points to the permanent system."
"FOR many years the sphere gap has been used for measuring high voltage at power frequencies1,2 and it is also used for impulse testing. However, at present the sphere gap is not an accepted standard for the measurement of radio-frequency voltages. This is largely attributable to the lack of complete data on the spark-over values of sphere gaps in air, at radio frequencies. Some results have been published3‾6 but they are not altogether consistent and the spectrum of frequencies covered is far from complete."
"The theory of sampled-data systems using the method of the z-transform is extended and clarified. In particular, the equivalence between the z-transform in its closed form and the infinite summation used by some investigators is shown. Important characteristics of the pulsed transfer function, and initial and final value theorems are developed for the z-domain. An extensive table is given of z-transform pairs covering the most important and most commonly encountered system functions and input functions. The technique for stabilizing and shaping the pulsed transfer locus is demonstrated. In particular, the application of linear compensating networks in the continuous part of the system is investigated. Design criteria are obtained which relate the transient response of sampled-data systems and the frequency response."
"THE International Radio Regulations establishing 2,182 kc as the international calling and distress frequency for maritime mobile radiotelephony in the 1,605-to 2,850-kc band came into effect May 1, 1953.1 Many government stations have been equipped for operation on this frequency. Parts 7 and 8 of the Rules of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) require that all ships and public coast stations using telephony in this band be equipped for operation on 2,182 kc. Completion of arrangements for the full utilization of this frequency by ship and coast stations in the United States was scheduled for July 1, 1954."
"The method of undetermined coefficients is applied to the solution of typical nonlinear electric circuit problems of importance in electrical engineering. This method is shown to give useful approximate values for the amplitudes and phases of the forced oscillations of the nonlinear circuits considered. The effects of bias potentials on the amplitudes of the oscillations are also determined. The utility of the method is illustrated by applying it to the analysis of forced oscillations of a nonlinear inductor, a saturable reactor, a nonlinear capacitor, and a series-connected magnetic amplifier."
"THE increasing number of applications of magnetic amplifiers to automatic control problems has brought about the necessity of being able to measure and to describe analytically the performance of such amplifiers as a function of time, so that the designer is able to predict the stability of a control system in which they are used. The time function most useful in applying a magnetic amplifier to a closed-loop control system is its frequency-response characteristic which describes the action of the amplifier in terms of amplification and phase shift of a sinusoidal control voltage which is varied in frequency over some specified range."
"Measurement of phasor relationships in networks is considered in general, and a system is described which accomplishes this task. Numerical examples for purposes of orientation are given. Detection is based on the performance of a phase-sensitive rectifier of the ring modulator type. A system is described, using a pair of such detectors being polarized by two auxiliary voltages, of the frequency under consideration, the voltages being in time quadrature to each other. In this manner true null detection is accomplished unambiguously. The differential polarized rectifier, the polarizing supply circuit, and the required auxiliary amplifiers, containing means of amplitude-and-phase adjustment, are discussed briefly. Operation in the frequency range of 1 to 1,000 cycles for input signals of the order of 100 microvolts and for extremely adverse signal-to-noise ratios is accomplished with an over-all accuracy of 1 per cent."
"The dynamics of a closed-loop method of phase control of a local oscillator are discussed in this paper. An equivalent circuit is derived, on which further analysis of the system is based. While a linearized system and a system which uses time domain filtering have appeared in the literature, this paper presents a new, simple, and direct approach to the optimization of the system. A more general analysis is given and the general requirements for the nonlinear element and the subtraction device are pointed out. A method of design for the equalization filter is given. The theory is verified with experimental results."
"MAGNETIC recording has attained an important position in the field of digital data storage because of its simplicity and economy. Information is handled in binary form, requiring a discrimination between only two states. These states correspond to two opposite senses of saturation, and new information is then merely recorded over that previously contained, erasing being unnecessary. This paper is primarily concerned with the development of a useful mathematical description of the process of magnetic recording of binary information. A concept of this process is developed which furnishes an analytical basis for design evaluation. While a large part of the following is applicable to binary storage on a continuous magnetic medium in general, the paper is specifically concerned with a magnetic drum unit using a ring-type magnetic recording head, wherein the type of magnetization is referred to as longitudinal. This is at present the most common form for a magnetic drum memory system."
"OCCASIONALLY, telephone plant and equipment are subjected to voltages and currents from external sources which are very much larger than those used in normal operation. A reasonable reserve in dielectric strength and current capacity is provided, but to cope with the more severe extraneous voltages it is necessary to provide protective arrangements."
"ONE of the principal reasons for designing the various equipment units of N,1 O,2 and ON3 carrier telephone systems on a plug-in basis was to facilitate normal maintenance of these systems. Thus, a faulty unit can easily be replaced by a spare to restore service quickly. The unit in trouble may then be repaired later. The more serious repair work may be done at centrally located “servicing centers,” where it can be done efficiently. Since each individual unit performs at least one complete function, it can be completely tested separately."
"A method for shaping the characteristics of temperature-sensitive elements is described, together with a practical example. The proposed method permits the shaping of characteristics of the temperature-sensitive elements in order to obtain the desired form. This method could be applied successfully to any temperature-sensitive element providing that the coefficient of the temperature-sensitive element is larger than that of the desired characteristic, and that the characteristic of the temperature-sensitive element does not change with the applied voltage."
"PLANS for mechanizing the handling of long-distance telephone calls, using common control equipment to obtain improved quality of service and economy of operation, were initiated in 1941 and the first installation of this type was made at Philadelphia in 1943.1 In spite of the delays occasioned by the war, substantial progress has since been made in this project which affects nearly every phase of telephone operation, so that by 1954 more than 50 per cent of all long-distance calls in the United States are being completed on a mechanized basis. Many technical articles have been written describing the general plan for mechanization, as well as specific parts.2‾7  This paper is intended to cover the problems involved in applying the nationwide dialing plan to the territory operated by The Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania. It should be clear, however, that the independent telephone companies which operate a large part of the area of the State of Pennsylvania are participating in these plans."
"THE increasing size and complexity of analogue and digital computers has resulted in an ascending demand for expanding quantities of well-regulated and filtered d-c power. As the machines have grown in size the regulated power demands have gone from milliamperes to amperes, to tens of amperes, and now to hundreds of amperes. These increased loads have been supplied by various methods, most of which offered compromises with desired performance."
"MANY analogue computers of the electronic type include combinations of a few “building blocks” called operational amplifiers. This paper analyzes the basic properties of voltage and current operational amplifiers and discusses some of the problems of designing the circuitry using junction transistors. Although much has been written about the voltage operational amplifier,1 especially where vacuum tubes are employed, it is hoped that this presentation of the subject will emphasize those properties of the network configuration which become important if transistors are to be used. A somewhat different approach to making the best use of transistors in the analogue computer type of circuits is to use currents instead of voltages as the dependent variables. This leads to what in some respects seems to be a more reasonable utilization of the natural properties of transistors than the obvious expedient of simply “transistorizing” existing circuits. One of the aims of this paper is to explore this possibility in a rather general way and to relate the principles and philosophy of the current operational amplifier to the more familiar voltage case. The analysis is based on the small signal operation of devices such as vacuum tubes and transistors which allows them to be replaced by the usual equivalent circuits. No attempt will be made to include practical circuit diagrams."
"For use in comparing working standard cells with the potential from a “normal” or saturated cell, presumably one of a group maintained as a voltage reference, a simplified comparator is presented. Complete circuit details are given, as well as a description of the necessary auxiliary items."
"There are a number of new and powerful techniques rapidly being developed for the analysis and synthesis of feedback control systems. Four of these techniques are illustrated by some of the papers in this issue. One of the most fruitful of these is in the field of statistics, and in particular its application to nonlinear systems. R. C. Booton presents a paper which derives the cross-power density spectrum for a component with saturation or clipping. From this cross-power operator one can determine the quantity of output signal which is correlated with the input, the amount of harmonic distortion power present in the output, and an equivalent \"gain\" term satisfactory for use in testing for the build-up of periodic oscillations."
"The describing-function method for the analysis of nonlinear systems with sinusoidal inputs is interpreted as a mean-square quasi-linearization technique and is generalized to apply to random signals. An amplitude-sensitive (or zero-memory) nonlinearity is interpreted as being approximately equivalent to a linear frequency-insensitive device, and a formula is derived for its equivalent gain. A simple rate-limited control system with a Gaussian input is analyzed as a specific application. Approximation of a general nonlinear element (containing memory) is considered next, and a relation between equivalent-system impulse response and the response of the actual nonlinearity is derived."
"A method is presented for molding non-linear elements of a system into equivalent linear elements so that existing linear methods of analysis and synthesis may be applied. The method can be applied in a Large number of practical cases, particularly in the more complex systems. It is based upon a Fourier expansion of the output waveform of a sinusoidally excited discontinuous element. Several cases of practical importance are considered, and charts are presented which may be used in analysis or design."
"This paper introduces a procedure for determing the stability of a feedback system using a dual Nyquist diagram. Such a diagram results when the characteristic equation of the system is interpreted to be the sum of two frequency-dependent functions F1(p) + F2(p) instead of the normal expression 1 + G(p)H(p). This diagram then consists of two polar plots; one plot represents the locus of one of the functions which is contained in the characteristic equation, and the other plot is the negative locus of the other function contained in the characteristic equation. Each of these curves may, if desired, be considered as an individual Nyquist diagram."
"The phase lead network, shown in figure 1, had demonstrated its ability to improve the relative stability of linear feedback amplifiers long before it was adopted as one of the principal stabilizing networks by those interested in the newer field of servomechanisms. Its wide acceptance was based upon its simple form when dealing with d.c. signals and its ability to produce rate-type signal components without mechanical devices. When used as a synthesis tool in connection with the Nyquist plot (1)* of the loop-transfer characteristics, it allows considerable freedom in shaping the contour to conform to generally acceptable standards of performance to the limited extent with which they can be interpreted on this Nyquist plot. The major drawback of the phase-lead network is its attenuation of the signal components, an attenuation which may be readily appreciated if this network is viewed as a resistance voltage divider under static (d.c.) conditions. This sacrifice is all the more objectionable in applications where higher-frequency noise components are present and the need to maintain the signal-to-noise ratio has virtually eliminated this useful tool from systems whose inputs contain large noise components. A system controlled by a radar signal provides just such a situation."
"In trying to design or adjust a dynamic system for optimum performance, the engineer is helped by a knowledge of theoretical limits on the capabilities of the system. Examples of such limits are the gain-bandwidth product of amplifier design and the coding theorem of information theory."
"This paper is concerned with the problem of optimizing the transient behavior of a servomechanism. In this instance the term optimum is used in the sense of a transient response in minimum time as compared with the familiar minimum RMS error criteria for an optimum system. The use of the term \"predictor\" arises from the fact that the system. utilizes the information contained in the Input and its derivatives in order to reduce the error to zero in an optimum manner."
"O. Brune1 has proved that any rational \"positive real\" function possesses a one terminal-pair network configuration containing a finite number of linear passive elements. Brune suggested the ladder synthesis for positive real functions. In general his synthesis procedure contains mutual couplings which are not desirable from a practical standpoint. Thus, there has always been a great desire to eliminate ideal transformers from the picture. As steps towards this goal, H. W. Bode2 suggests resistance padding, and E. A. Guillemin3 often uses some practical methods for eliminating the ideal transformer in special cases. The existence proof, along with a synthesis procedure without an ideal transformer, was first given by R. Bott and R. J. Duffin4."
"It is well known that the Fourier series is not the only trigonometric polynomial that may be used to represent a periodic function. It is a polynomial with the property that the mean square error between a partial sum and the given function is a minimum; that is to say, it approximates the given function so as to make the mean square error a minimum. This error criterion is only one of many that could be stipulated as fixing the manner in which the polynomial approximates the given function, and from a practical standpoint it isn't even a good one for many applications because it suffers from the Gibbs phenomenon. A Tschebyscheff-like approximation or the one inherent in the Cesaro sum which converges uniformly even at points of discontinuity may be preferable in many cases."
"Many problems in the theory of noise and other random functions can be formulated as the problem of finding the probability distribution of the functional $u = \\int\\limits^\\infty_0 K(t') \\, V\\, (X (t'))dt'$ where K(t) and V(x) are known functions and x(t) is a random function of known statistical properties. The problem of finding the probability distribution of the noise output of a receiver consisting of a filter, a detector, and a second filter is of this type. Methods will be discussed which have led to solutions of this problem in some special cases. In the case of multidimensionally Markoffian x(t) the problem will be shown to be equivalent to an integral equation, which in many cases of interest reduces to a differential equation."
"A complete theory of detection is presented, which is capable of treating general types of signals (e.g. periodic, aperiodic, random) in noise of arbitrary statistical character. By proper formulation of the detection problem as a test of statistical hypotheses, the precise structure of the optimum detector can be specified and minimum detectable signals uniquely determined. For threshold reception (the problem of main interest) two classes of operation arise: if detection is coherent, as far as dependence on the input signal-to-noise ratio is concerned one has a linear system, no matter how weak the signal; on the other hand for incoherent reception one always has a quadratic dependence on this input ratio (modulation suppression). Threshold reception in these two instances requires respectively a suitably weighted cross-correlation of the received data with the a priori known signal, or a suitably weighted autocorrelation of the received data with itself. The optimum detector is in general a computer, involving non-linear operations and terminating in a decision operation, which depends on the type of statistical test (e.g. Neyman-Pearson, Ideal, Sequential, etc.) defining the observer. The threshold of decision is necessarily determined by a suitable betting or cost curve. (Both discrete (digital) and continuous (analog) sampling of the data are considered.) In this way optimum performance, consistent with the external constraints, is specified, and the extent by which actual systems depart from this limiting optimum can be calculated."
"This morning you have heard excellent presentations of two fields of endeavor, the results and techniques of which could be basic to a statistical theory of communication engineering. On the one hand, the field of statistical inference, as applied to discrete stochastic processes, has developed to a refined point due to the efforts of many statisticians. — The work of the late Professor Wald in his successful application of Von Neumann's game theory to the construction of a general theory of decision functions has played a dominant role in the development of these refinements. On the other hand, the theory of stochastic processes depending upon a discrete or continuous time parameter has been developed during the last three deoades by various mathematicians, only during the last few years has the study of statistical inference problems for continuous stochastic processes received much attention. Here the outstanding contribution is the thesis of Ulf Grenander, published in the Arkiv för matematik, Band 1, Häfte 3, 1950. In attempting to apply the techniques of statistical inference to continuous processes, it is evident that the central problem is to obtain a coordinate system for the process which allows one to actually carry out. the computations called for by various statistical methods. As far as I am aware, there are at present only two types of continuous stochastic processes for which a coordinate system has been obtained with which one can carry through some of the computations necessary in the testing of statistical hypotheses. One process is a projection on to the real axis of a finite dimensional Markoff process, Gaussian or non Gaussian. The other process is a Gaussian process with a continuous covariance function. The restriction of a continuous covariance function is not serious, since this property applies to all of the stochastic models which have been set up to study continuous processes occurring in communication engineering. (The assumption that the spectrum of a process is a \"pure white noise\" is not consistent with continuity of the covariance function, but a pure white noise is merely a mathematical idealization. The process with a flat band limited spectrum — a model often used in application — does possess a continuous covariance function.) On the other hand, the restriction to Gaussian processes is one which would be desirable to remove in some cases."
"A fairly broad class of problems deals with the way certain properties of noise are altered on passage through a linear system. Fig. l defines these properties. If any n instants of time are chosen and if boundary value problems of the zero crossing type are omitted, the specification of the n dimensional probability distribution yields the most complete statistical information. Very often, however, this information is difficult or impossible to find and it is useful to obtain properties (2) and (3) of Fig. 1 without actually knowing property (1). Briefly, an nth order random process is defined by no more than an n dimensional probability distribution. Given a higher order distribution, it can be reduced to order n. The example in Fig. 1 shows how, for a 2nd degree (a Markoff) process, a trivariate form can be expressed in terms of bivariate and lower forms. A stationary process is one whose statistical properties do not depend on the choice of time reference."
"This paper is concerned with certain applications of the estimation theory of Fisher and Cramer[1] to the problem of estimating signal parameters in the presence of noise. Specifically, the situation to be treated is as follows. A received signal"
"A signal is received in the time interval (t - T ≤ τ ≤ t). It is known that this signal is composed of noise plus intelligence a(t) which is statistical in nature and which has been modulated in some known way. Assuming that both intelligence and noise are Gaussian (although not necessarily stationary) time series, the analog of the classical maximum-likelihood estimate for α(t) is derived. The advantage of this approach is that it can handle arbitrary types of modulation. For unmodulated stationary intelligence and stationary noise, the solution reduces to that of Zadeh and Ragazzini. In the general case, the optimum estimate is given as the solution of a pair of integral equations. The amplitude-modulated case is treated in some detail. The application of the maximum-likelihood technique to problems involving arbitrary modulation was first suggested, as far as the author is aware, by F. W. Lehan and R. J. Parks of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory."
"The detection of several interfering modulated noise-like signals is described and an expression is derived for the resultant correlation function, The correlation function is used to demonstrate the modulation suppression action of a linear detector for the general case of signals of noise-like character. Since the detection process suppresses the temporal variations of the weaker signals in one portion of the output spectrum and the stronger signals in another, it is possible, under certain conditions, to effectively separate the modulation information of the original signals."
"The statistically-optimum unstable filter to separate desired signals from noise and other undesired signals is shown to take the form of a high gain amplifier, with several output channels, each one of which computes the best statistical measure of one of the signals or the noise. The sum of these outputs comprises a negative feedback circuit. The imposition of the requirement of stability on the overall system is shown to be the same as the imposition of stability on each component plus a small correction in the zero locations. The addition of nonlinear components follows from differences in the amplitude probability distributions. The methods of automatically compensating for the unalterable dynamic characteristics of the output device, of the high gain amplifier, and for changes in the ratio of signal to noise power, are shown. The information needed for this design is the power density spectrum or autocorrelation function of each signal and noise, and the amplitude probability distribution of each. The mechanics of the design are quite simple, and can be done with only a conventional knowledge of circuit theory. A new philosophy of statistically optimum systems is formulated, which embraces both linear and nonlinear systems, and eliminates the necessity of minimizing the error power."
"The purpose of the investigation to be reported here differs in one essential respect from the purpose of most statistical studies on problems of communication. We wish to state this difference from the beginning, in order to avoid misunderstanding of the methods used later on. Most communication problems are, broadly speaking, engineering problems; that is, they deal with the construction and evaluation of new methods of communication, using one's knowledge of \"Nature,\" acquired elsewhere. Our problem is, broadly speaking, physical; we seek to improve our knowledge, or at least our description, of \"Nature\" by using models in which some statistical concepts, developed in the study of recent communication problems, are used side by side with such concepts of physics as were already used to solve older engineering problems. This difference of purpose will also explain an unessential character of this paper: the calculations are much simpler than in other papers of the symposium, because here one could choose the problems leading to simple theories by the present methods (but not by previous ones), whereas in other papers the problems were imposed."
"Codes have been discussed recently in connection with signal compression and noise reduction in communication theory, and they are here defined as transformations between two time series of discrete symbols. The electronic apparatus which performs the transformation, or any part of the apparatus, can be described by a linear graph which represents transitions between different memory-states. It will be shown how these graphs can be used to systematically classify codes, combine different blocks of apparatus, examine synchronism of decoding apparatus, etc. Linear graphs have been studied as mathematical systems in connection with topology, Markov chains, and electrical network theory; hence there is already much theory which might be profitably applied to communication problems."
"Haying determined a cost in energy, time, or money of transmitting each of a set of symbols (e.g., dot and dash, pulses of various amplitudes, etc.), one may inquire as to the nature of a code using these symbols which will transmit a given amount of information at the least cost, or will transmit information at a given rate for the least cost per unit time. Such a code must use each symbol with a relative frequency given by a negative exponential of a linear combination of its cost and duration in the case of a noiseless communication channel. If noise is present, the cost of each symbol is effectively increased by a multiple of its \"prevarication,\" i.e., the entropy of the received symbol when only the given symbol is transmitted."
"In the course of staking general evaluations of servo systems utilizing magnetic amplifiers, the inadequacy of classical methods becomes immediately evident. Statistical treatment of the signal and the system error is neccessary criteria of performance other than the quadratic are essential; and it is possible that accurate evaluation can result only from including the effects of the inherent non-linearities of the system. Progress to date has resulted in three separate approaches to the problem: a) A computer which includes a system analog, and an error criterion and integrating circuit, and which accepts statistically typical signals from a signal storage or generating device. There results a single number describing the performance of the system. b) An analytical method applicable only to linear systems, which makes use of the atrtocorrelation function of the signal and noise inputs, and also of the higher moment correlation fkutions of the two. c) An analytical method applicable in instanrces when the signal spectrum changesabruptly. The anaysis is applicable only to linear systems and considers a quadratic criterion."
"A common problem in radar, navigation systems or pulse-time modulation systems is that of determination of the delay or time of arrival of a pulse or other distinctive modulation form. while considerable effort has been directed toward the optimization in various senses of the signal-to-noise ratios for such signals, the problem of the most accurate determination of time delay of signals in noise bas, with a few noteworthy exceptions, been taken for granted. It is of interest to examine this problem for its own sake, not only as indicative of optimum circuit practice, but, more important, in order to make clear the fundamental accuracy limitations and the manner in which these limitations depend upon signal and noise parameters. The consideration of this paper is limited to the case where there is no doubt as to the existence nor approximate position of a pulse but where the accuracy of determination of pulse position is limited by noise. This case is therefore more representative of the problems of high accuracy systems such as Loran or shoran than of radar."

"Thinking that a review of the progress made toward unity might be of value, a committee from the Board of Directors was appointed to make this study.∗ This committee submitted its report to the Board at its meeting on January 21, 1954, and the report is presented in the following for your information. This report was approved by the Board, and the Institute's representatives on Engineers Joint Council were instructed to advise the Council of the seriousness with which we view the need for real unity, and to work toward implementing the recommendations of the committee."
"Since the engineer is concerned primarily with the product of his brain, it is important that he know something about the care and handling of intellectual property. It is with the engineer's interest in mind that this condensed statement of the essentials of patent law has been prepared."
"LOCATED ON THE South Fork of the Flathead River in northwestern Montana are the Hungry Horse Dam and Power Plant which constitute a key unit in a comprehensive program for multiple-purpose development of the vast resources of the Columbia River and its tributaries."
"This is the first of a series of short biographical sketches of ten founding fathers of the electrical science to appear serially in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING. The selection is arbitrary and other men of equal or possibly greater competence necessarily must be omitted. The series should prove of particular interest to members and students, providing a better understanding of the founders of some of the fundamental electrical principles and units used in daily work. Dr. William Gilbert, royal physician and author of the first treatise on electricity, demonstrated almost all the properties of the magnet, identified the earth as a great magnet, and taught the distinction between electrical and magnetic attraction."
"This new installation consisting of two 145,000-kw units was designed to achieve a plant which would be straightforward and simply arranged with central controls to reduce operating effort. The addition of these units increases the Kearny generating station's capacity to 624,000 kw."
"THE TIN PLATING industry began in Wales several hundred years ago. Early processes were largely manual, without automatic devices. American ingenuity progressed the art to the modern control giant—the electrolytic tinning line. The modern line has evolved from a pilot line which originally was installed and tested in 1936–1937. The program of automatic electrolytic tinning also was looked upon by our federal government as a good “tin saver.” As much as a pound or more of tin could be saved for every 40,000 square inches of tin plate produced."
"THE DIELECTRIC VOLTAGE amplifier shown in Fig. 1 utilizes a nonlinear dielectric (ferroelectric) condenser (capacitor) as part of a series-resonant circuit. This circuit is excited by a carrier source whose voltage and frequency are constant. The capacity of the nonlinear condenser (capacitor) is varied by the signal voltage to be amplified. Of course, a change in the capacity alters the tuning of the resonant circuit, and since the carrier frequency is constant, the circulating carrier current in the resonant circuit is modulated by the signal. The voltages appearing across the elements of the circuit likewise will be modulated. If one of these voltages, usually that across the inductance, is demodulated, a voltage output is obtained which, in a properly designed amplifier, has similar waveshape but larger amplitude than the input signal. Thus a voltage gain is realized."
"The numerous scientific developments of the past decade or so have broadened the field of electrical engineering considerably. Consequently, engineering educators now are asking themselves how their curricula best can meet the new demands. Recent progress has been in the direction of more basic science in engineering, to give the student the underlying concepts from which he can evolve specialized tools and techniques."
"INDUSTRIES USING large concentrations of electric power at generated voltages have created a demand for circuit breakers and associated switchgear for operation at generated voltages of 12,000 to 15,000 volts, a-c, and at continuous current ratings in excess of 5,000 amperes. The maximum standard current rating for station-type cubicles is 5,000 amperes and is limited by the maximum current rating of the circuit breaker. The problem, therefore, was to increase the limitation imposed by the breaker. The design which resulted is shown in Fig. 1. In reviewing the developments of the last 40 years in electrical engineering as applied to tankers the great increase in use and types of applications is emphasized. Electrical consumption has grown from a few to tens of thousands of kilowatt-hours. It is now vital to propulsion, navigation, communication, cargo handling, cooking, safety, and entertainment."

"IN A PREVIOUS paper1 it was shown how expressions for vector potential could be derived from corresponding values of scalar potential for a point source which are given in Tables of Green's Functions previously published.2 It then was shown how these expressions for vector potential could be used to derive the electromagnetic fields due to uniformly magnetized disks, or due to coils by building them up from magnetic doublets or individual current elements by integration. The examples given in that paper1 were limited to those in which the field did not vary with time, since some additional concepts need to be introduced when the field varies with time."
"The chairman of the AIEE Committee on Public Relations discusses the committee's 1954 plans for a national co-operative public relations program in line with its desire for better understanding by the public of what the electrical engineer means to the nation and to the community. IT IS now time to take another step ahead in the further development of a forward-looking program of public relations for the AIEE. The 1954 program as envisaged by the AIEE Committee on Public Relations with the continuing support and active co-operation of the Institute leadership and membership throughout the country should rebound not only to the benefit of the organization, but to a better and wider understanding by the public of what the electrical engineer and his profession contribute to the progress and welfare of the entire population."
"THE CONTACT between a carbon brush and a revolving commutator is assumed in the accepted theories of commutation to occur over the total brush face and to be constant in position and length of circumferential arc. But this is not always so in practice. Under certain circumstances the contact area may shrink either from the entering or leaving edge of the brush or both with time, sometimes in days, sometimes in weeks."
"The Federal Communications Commission granted an experimental permit to the Rural Radio Network to operate two FM transmitters of its chain by remote control. Operators are informed continually of the stations' functioning which they control by dialing."
"Two prototype submarine atomic power plants are being developed: the Submarine Thermal Reactor and the Submarine Intermediate Reactor. Their fundamentals are discussed as are those of a gas-cooled reactor power plant."
"A REVIEW OF THE literature concerned with magnetic amplifiers has revealed a multitude of articles dealing with the load circuit and sometimes control circuit response of single-core amplifiers employing the self-saturation principle. These discussions all have utilized specific assumptions which in each case were aimed toward an ultimate simplification of the mathematical manipulations directed toward the solution of the required response. In some cases the assumptions are valid; however, the general case of magnetic amplifier operation often suffers because of the specializations thus used. It therefore seems worth while to consider a rigorous mathematical analysis based upon the existence of finite forward and reverse rectifier resistances as well as a flux-current loop of finite area and finite slope."
"The various factors affecting the choice between the three basic types of amplifier suitable for line amplifiers in community television systems are discussed. The data clearly favor use of the single-channel amplifier, and increasingly so as the system is extended. However, the increased economy of the cascade broad-band types makes it preferable on small systems with short cable runs and few repeaters."
"In recent years, scientific research has been moving out of the laboratory into new fields to deal with management problems by attempting to reach an understanding of the operation involved. In this respect, one of its essential elements is the development of an operations research model from which phenomena can be deduced to check against the observed facts."
"The transmission of a repeater section consisting of 4 miles of coaxial cable and a repeater including equalizing networks was measured in the laboratory. The measuring circuit was switched between the unknown and a short reference strap at a rapid rate. This reduced the effects of level drifts in the measuring oscillator amplifier and detector to a point where an accuracy of ±0.001 decibel over a range of ±0.05 decibel was obtained. The measurements were automatically recorded in pen and ink over a frequency range of 0.1 to 8.3 megacycles."
"IN THE DESIGN of transformers, there are a great many problems regarding fields. Both dielectric and magnetic fields are involved and most of them are extremely difficult to solve mathematically. One problem involving the magnetic field is that of stray losses and heating of tanks. A specific case illustrative of this problem is the core-type transformer with unbalanced windings."
"AS CONTROL EQUIPMENT becomes more automatic and accuracy requirements increase, more highly specialized position-sensing equipment becomes necessary. In the signal-generator type of position-sensing equipment, angular rotation of the input shaft causes a proportionate voltage to appear as the output of the device. It is usually desirable that the output be of line frequency and phase sensitive, that is, that the voltage increases on either side of a minimum or null voltage position and the phase of the output shift 180° as the rotor passes through the null position. This article describes a signal generator which has two unique characteristics: (1) the output is practically unaffected by linear motions of the rotor, and (2) magnetic side pull on the rotor is negligible even when the rotor is not centered."
"Industrial applications of audio-tone equipment make numerous unique design requirements. However, the design of this equipment has been facilitated by utilizing experience gained in designing carrier-current equipment to perform these same functions. High reliability has been emphasized to keep total costs to the user at a minimum."
"The development of practical useful power in the uhf band was made possible through the use of the high-powered cascade klystron amplifier. This amplifier is discussed here together with the transmitter, as this type of klystron is less well known. It was found to be the only tube using transit time to advantage which withstood the test of time in generating high power for all uhf channels in the frequency spectrum of 470 to 890 mc."
"Tube and transistor circuits are compared, particularly as applied to audio circuits. Specifications for a 6SC7 tube and a 2N43 transistor are compared with emphasis on the distinctive features. A phonograph preamplifier is developed both for tubes and transistors to show the basic differences in the two circuits. Basic equations also are given for the two designs and their over-all characteristics compared."
"The AIEE North Eastern District Meeting for 1954 will be held in Schenectady, N. Y., May 5–7. The Hotel Van Curler will serve as headquarters for the meeting and all technical sessions will be held there."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"The AIEE — Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) Conference on Transistor Circuits, held in Philadelphia, Pa., February 18–19, 1954, presented 18 papers to over 600 registrants, including some from Canada and England. Originally scheduled for the University of Pennsylvania Museum Auditorium, the meetings were moved to the university's Irvine Auditorium because of the large attendance."
"The 1954 Electronics Components Symposium will be held in the Department of Interior Auditorium, Washington, D. C., on May 4–6. The theme this year is “Technical Progress in Component Development, Fabrication, and Use, With Emphasis on New Advances in the Art.” The fifth of a series of national meetings on electronic component parts and materials, the symposium is being sponsored jointly by the AIEE, the Institute of Radio Engineers, the Radio-Electronics-Television Manufacturers Association, and the West Coast Electronic Manufacturers Association, with active participation by agencies of the Department of Defense and the National Bureau of Standards. The headquarters hotel will be the Roger Smith."
"Dr. Allen V. Astin, director of the National Bureau of Standards, was the main speaker at the AIEE Washington (D. C.) Section's Annual Student Night on February 13, 1954, which was attended by some 140 persons. This event is held for the entertainment of Student members from the four colleges in the Section: Catholic University, George Washington University, University of Maryland, and Howard University."
"Editor's Note: This department has been created for the convenience of the various AIEE technical committees and will include brief news reports of committee activities.

"The Board of Examiners at its meeting of February 18, 1954, recommended the following members for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objections to these transfers should be filed at once with the Secretary of the Institute. A statement of valid reasons for such objections, signed by a member, must be furnished and will be treated as confidential."
"Radar stations to track new supersonic guided missiles across the world's longest proving ground are linked under the Atlantic Ocean by a slender coaxial cable insulated with Bakelite polyethylene. When completed, the new U. S. Air Force Missile Test Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., will have a test range extending more than 1,000 miles southeast into the Caribbean, and this can be extended to 5,000 miles if necessary."

"In this atomic age an effective military research and development program assumes a special importance. The Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Development, presents an over-all view of his office's operations and problems."
"In view of the increasing interest in the accreditation of engineering curricula, this “letter to a college president” attempts to set forth, informally but factually, the types of questions that a visiting committee of the Engineers' Council for Professional Development would consider in its efforts to determine the acceptability of an engineering program for listing by the Council."
"Otto von Guericke constructed the first electric machine—an electrostatic generator—by means of which he generated the first visible and audible electric discharges. With the new machine he observed the behavior of the electric charge along the electrical body, and took the first step in the ever-extending process of electric transmission of power."
"During the past decade a great many changes have taken place in the engineering schools and still other changes are in progress today. The results of an analysis of the curricula of more than 100 colleges offering courses in electrical engineering are presented."
"The supply of and demand for engineering graduates was the subject of two surveys conducted by a Special Surveys Committee of Engineers Joint Council during 1953: a survey of engineering schools to determine the number of graduates and their probable distribution, and a survey of industry to determine the demand for engineers."
"The unity of the engineering profession is a topic of great interest to engineers. In the belief that the Engineers Joint Council can become the unity organization that the profession is seeking, the author shows how the Council is organized, and discusses what it is doing now and how it is developing."
"The objectives in the development of a new integrated line of Teletype apparatus especially designed to serve adequately both present and future printing telegraph applications are described together with the Teletype Model 28 Direct Keyboard Page Printer Set. It is composed of a page typing unit, keyboard, electrical service unit, and their motor drive and cabinet housing."
"STATIC NETWORK THEORY can be extended to the analysis of rotating machinery to obtain the present concepts in machine analysis and, at the same time, develop the precision and procedures necessary to analyze more complex problems. It is believed that the unity, the fundamental characteristics of the procedures, and the concept of a transformation of variable involved in this extension lead to a clearer understanding of the problem and to a marked increase in the complexity of problems that can be solved."
"Although gas-turbine power plants eliminate the need for much of the equipment associated with steam turbines, they present some special problems such as how to accelerate them to their self-sustaining speed."
"IN RECENT YEARS, many new overhead lines have been built without transpositions in the individual line section and experience has indicated that transpositions are rarely necessary. The elimination of transposition structures leads to geometrical unsymmetry of the phases along the line section, and consequently to small electrostatic and electromagnetic unbalances. In this study are investigated characteristic electromagnetic unbalance factors of various configurations of single circuit lines, i.e., various triangular and flat arrangements without and with ground wires."
"With the tremendous loads considered for 330-kv lines, circuit breakers functioning at this voltage are needed with 2,000 amperes continuous current capacity and an interrupting rating of 25 million kva. The description of a breaker's new design, permitting the full interrupting rating to be demonstrated with present test facilities, and its assembly demonstrate how designers and engineers have solved the problems presented by the power companies. FIVE YEARS ago development progress was reported on circuit breakers rated 10 million kva at 230 kv.1,2 Since that time breakers of this rating have been built and installed on 138-kv, 161-kv, and 230-kv systems.3–5 Instead of this rating proving to be a ceiling, an interrupting capacity of 15 million kva has been considered at 161 kv, 230 kv, and 330 kv. Now the heavy loads being projected for 330-kv lines in this country, particularly the tremendous concentration of electric power at the new Atomic Energy Commission plant near Portsmouth, Ohio, have brought a demand for 330-kv breakers with 2,000 amperes continuous current capacity and the unprecedented interrupting rating of 25 million kva. This article describes one way in which this challenge has been met, and in particular how the high arc-rupturing capacity has made necessary a radically new design which will permit the full interrupting rating to be demonstrated adequately with available High Power Laboratory testing facilities."
"THE FIRST INSTALLATION of the Magamp regulator and excitation system on a turbine generator was placed in service in the Springdale Station of the West Penn Power Company on April 1, 1953. The machine to which it was applied is a 50,000-kw 3,600-rpm hydrogen-cooled topping unit. Performance tests were conducted on the unit on July 19, 1953. The purpose of this digest is to present the operating experience and the results of the tests."
"LARGE BANKS of high-voltage capacitors are being used to an increasing extent for voltage regulation and reactive power generation. Recent experience switching 30,000 reactive kilovolt-amperes in two parallel banks at 115 kv on the Bonneville Power System has indicated the special nature of the switching problems associated with the use of oil circuit breakers for energizing and de-energizing such large capacitances."
"A STUDY OF THE flow of electromagnetic energy in a typical, somewhat idealized 3-phase alternator is carried out on the basis of the electromagnetic field analysis with the objective of a better understanding of synchronous machines from an educational and analytical standpoint, and in the hope that it may be of value in design. This article constitutes a sequel to a previous similar study of d-c machines.1 Relatively few authors have considered problems in electric machinery on this basis.2–4"
"POWER CIRCUIT BREAKERS now are being installed on the first 330-kv power lines in the United States. This initial use will be at the Muskingum River plant of the Ohio Power Company, an operating company of the American Gas and Electric Company system."
"The measurement of currents at the higher frequencies is made difficult by the increased inductances and capacitances inherent in measuring equipment used for low-frequency alternating currents. Here are presented the theory, construction, and performance of a wide-frequency-range ammeter with excellent characteristics in the vhf band."
"This completely supercharged generator takes full advantage of increased gas pressures and has virtually no load limit because of temperatures. Although both simpler and more rugged than its partially supercharged predecessor, at the same time it permits the user to effect substantial savings in power plant space and costs."
"THE CALCULATION of power-system swing curves generally is performed by using one of several point-by-point techniques in conjunction with an a-c network analyzer. The technique is well known and while greatly simplified by use of the network analyzer is still laborious and time-consuming. At least one analogue for the automatic and continuous determination of swing curves has been devised and several have been proposed. This digest illustrates a method for direct determination of swing curves by interconnection of a network analyzer with a differential analyzer.1"
"THE USE OF tungsten wire for the sensing element of a resistance thermometer is not new to the art. However, to the best knowledge of the authors, this thermometer, Fig. 1, is the first successful one with stabilities as good as, or better than, platinum."
"Feedback control techniques have been applied to automatic flight control problems to produce a new type of automatic pilot. It provides unlimited maneuverability by using three simple nontumbling rate-type gyroscopes to regulate the angular velocity of the aircraft about its principal axes. The three basic control loops, without use of vacuum tubes, combine electric and hydraulic power boost means in proportional-type servomechanisms which actuate the aircraft's control surfaces."
"LIGHTNING FAULTS on high-voltage transmission lines are due exclusively to direct strokes to the line. Faults on distribution lines operating below 33 kv may be caused in addition by indirect strokes which strike the ground near the line or which contact an earthed (grounded) part of the line without causing back flashover."
"CORROSION OF underground structures is basically an electrochemical process which conforms to Faraday's law of electrolysis. In anodic areas, current discharge from cables and pipes results in electrolytic corrosion at the annual rate of 75 pounds of lead or 20 pounds of iron loss per ampere discharged. Where the emf is external to the cables the corrosion cells may be caused by stray currents from d-c systems such as railways, or by electric connection of the lead cable sheath to more noble metals. Where the emf is internal to the cable sheath, corrosion cells usually result from exposure of the cable to an electrolytic environment in which variations exist in soil aeration, moisture, salt content, and texture. Soil bacteria probably are influential in causing differences in aeration in the soil and duct mud and thus generating a corrosion cell."
"This system of graphic analysis and notation was developed with the goal of establishing a uniform set of network illustrations which could be used in analyzing the operating characteristics and faults of the network. Although it now has been in use about 2 years, only one change has been made in the original legend to avoid ambiguity and two new symbols added for recently incorporated equipment."
"A SINUSOIDAL RESPONSE method of analysis and synthesis of a contactor servomechanism employing sampled data in the error channel is introduced. Fig. 1 shows the block diagram of the particular servo system under investigation. Due to the presence of the sampler, clamper, and contactor the system is discontinuous in time as well as being nonlinear. An exact system performance can be obtained only by laborious computations, moreover, no exact analytic solution in closed form can be obtained. However, much can be learned about the system by employing a sinusoidal response technique. Although an approximate method, the sinusoidal method provides a useful guide in analysis and synthesis."
"IN THE PAST few years a strong trend has developed toward the evaluation of electrical insulation by functional testing. It seems generally agreed that (a) the present AIEE, A, B, and H temperature classifications are no longer adequate, and (b) functional tests rather than chemical structure alone should provide the basis for classification. For example, several recent AIEE papers have proposed various accelerated life test procedures for deciding whether a given material or system will have a satisfactory life expectancy at a continuous hot-spot temperature of 105, 130, or 180 C and, therefore, can be designated properly as Class A, B, or H."
"This carrier-relaying system meets the requirements for ultrahigh-speed operation. A relaying time of 1/2 cycle to a maximum of 15/16 cycle has been obtained and both ease of maintenance and reliability have been achieved. This system has broad applications and its accuracy and sensitivity are equal to or exceed its electromechanical counterpart."
"THERE ARE TWO FACTS about single-phase induction motors which have not been generally recognized."
"THE GROWTH in size and complexity of power systems has resulted in a trend toward multiwinding transformers. A frequent consideration in the application of these multiwinding transformers is the possibility of paralleling secondary windings."
"It has been announced that 53 sessions will comprise the technical program of the AIEE Summer and Pacific General Meeting to be held at the Hotel Biltmore, Los Angeles, Calif., June 21–25, 1954. These, together with the annual business meeting on Monday morning and the timely inspection trips, should make this meeting one of outstanding technical importance."

"An aircraft instrument that automatically gives a pilot his latitude and longitude without any air-to-ground or ground-to-air communication has been demonstrated by Ford Instrument Company, division of The Sperry Corporation. Already in production, the device promises to free pilots of most of their navigational problems. The full military name of the instrument is “The Computer Set, Latitude and Longitude AN/ASN-6,” often referred to as a “Ground Position Indicator.” It was developed by Ford Instrument Company under the auspices of the U. S. Air Force in conjunction with the Communications and Navigation Laboratory of the Wright Air Development Center."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"Heavily coated electrodes containing large quantities of powdered metal in their coatings obtain increased welding speeds on the order of 50 per cent, with appearance in smoothness and freedom from spatter almost equal to that obtained with automatic welding."
"An indirect-couple method for detecting electrical faults—short or interrupted circuits—has been developed primarily for aircraft systems. Also, the new detection method can be incorporated into industrial circuits to insure against the fire hazard of electrical faults."

"HENRY HARRISON HENLINE (AM '19, M '26 F '43) retires from the AIEE secretaryship on June 1, 1954. He joined the staff of the Institute in January 1927 after many years of active work with the Stanford University Branch (Counsellor, 1926), the San Francisco Section (Chairman, 1922–23), and the Pacific District (Chairman Student Activities Committee, 1926). Joining the staff as Assistant National Secretary, his first work assignment was to develop further the Student Branches and Sections which at that time were showing the first evidences of the tremendous future development."
"Creative thinking can be approached in somewhat the same way as a technical subject and the ability to think creatively may be acquired to a considerable extent. The characteristics, types, and processes of creative thinking are discussed."
"The engineering profession is coming of age, and one of the signs of its growing maturity has been the increasing demand for unity among engineers. In his address before a meeting of professional engineers, Mr. Fairman reiterates the importance of uniform state registration laws as a part of professional awareness."
"THE WIDE USE of induction motors in the home, the office, and the factory requires that they both look and sound well. The pleasing, if not handsome, appearance of present-day motors attests to the skill of the “appearance design” experts who have worked with motor engineers in recent years. Now, there is a growing demand that motors should have good “sonance design” also. They should give out a steady pleasing hum, just loud enough to show that they are performing their duties properly, but not loud enough to be noticed."
"Fifteen years ago nuclear fission was discovered; 5 years later the first large nuclear reactor was started, and 5 years after that start, the Atomic Energy Commission announced its first program of nuclear reactors for power. Many problems remain to be solved, with cost among the most important."
"IN ORDER TO INCREASE the starting torque, larger induction motors are built usually with skin-effect bars in their rotor. Fig. 1 shows various types of skin-effect bars. Types A, B, and C, mostly type C, are used in induction motors; type D is used in synchronous motors. The analytical investigation of the increase of resistance and decrease of slot-leakage reactance of the skin-effect bars is possible under the following assumptions: (1) the vertical component of the slot flux is negligible; (2) the permeability of the iron is infinite; (3) the resistivity of the conductor is constant over the depth of the slot; and (4) the current density along any line parallel to the bottom of the slot is constant."
"THE OPERATING TEMPERATURE of underground current-carrying conductors is affected directly by the thermal resistance and capacitance of their immediate environment. With pipe-type or directly buried cable, where soil alone comprises that environment, the thermal characteristics of that soil are of major importance. Soils vary considerably in respect to these characteristics, even in a given locality, and along the route of a cable line several miles in length, the range in values usually will be appreciable."
"Benjamin Franklin established the identity of friction-produced electricity and lightning, proposed the principles of the lightning rod, and evolved the single-fluid theory of electricity. He concluded that the peculiar property of charged bodies to attract and repel one another was the transfer of electric fluid, thus providing a complete understanding of the operation of capacitors and charged bodies. THERE WAS A SPAN of a century between the activity of Guericke and Benjamin Franklin. In this time several major contributions to the ever-growing interest in electricity were made, in particular the independent invention of the Leyden jar, or first capacitor, by E. G. von Kleist of Pomerania and Petrus van Musschenbroek of Leyden. Before Franklin, materials used in electrical experiments were separated into “electrics” and “nonelectrics.” The former were those bodies that could be charged by friction while held in the hands of the experimenter, while “nonelectrics” included those that could not be so charged."
"Inner-cooling of rotor and stator windings makes possible a substantial increase in the ratings of turbine generators. Improvements in associated components such as ventilation arrangements, blowers, coolers, and seals permit a compact and efficient construction."
"NEW ELECTRICAL ARRANGEMENTS of armature windings have been developed to meet two separate challenges in the design of large turbine generators: 1. To make machines of a given rating physically smaller and greatly extend the possible ratings of the largest machine. 2. In the design of double-winding generators, to remove many restrictions of long standing."
"Many high-temperature magnet-wire insulations are available which will meet initial design requirements and their suitability in this regard can be determined by comparatively simple and routine tests. Assessing the ability of such materials to maintain adequate properties throughout desired equipment life is somewhat more complicated. Consideration must be given to factors influencing deterioration and a criterion selected for the determination of insulation life. The most realistic results will be obtained when the material is tested in a configuration where the physical and electrical stresses are representative of those found in actual apparatus."
"Although the electrical utility industry has made an outstanding record in meeting the demands of its customers for electric service and the future seems extremely bright, the collective research effort of the industry does not appear adequate to insure its future against possible inroads of competition from other forms of energy delivery, possible new developments, and from encroachments by government. A broad program of basic research, conducted on a co-operative basis to supplement the existing research conducted by the manufacturers and the utilities themselves, is recommended strongly as a means of insuring the industry's future."
"Inner-cooling of high-voltage generator stator coils has made possible greatly increased ratings for the magnetic and conductor materials in large hydrogen-cooled machines. This has required modification in some insulation design practices and application methods."
"DURING RECENT YEARS there has been a pronounced increase in load requirements and operating temperatures of power cable systems. The accompanying increase in cyclical expansion movement of cable in underground ducts has placed such a severe bending burden on ordinary sheath, such as copper bearing, that sheath life no longer can be co-ordinated with insulation life. Alloy sheaths with greatly improved bending fatigue resistance are a solution of this problem."
"Important characteristics of electroluminescent lamps are presented together with the most plausible mechanisms of electroluminescence and the three general types of applications."
"WHEN NETWORK THEORY is used, the analysis of the commutating machine differs from that of the noncommutating machine in that a new transient is initiated as the commutator segments enter or leave the brush contact area. In establishing the equations of operation, each interval of time during which no switching occurs is considered. As in the analysis of the noncommutating machine, the first step is that of establishing a connection diagram of the machine for the interval of time under consideration. When the general condition of q1 and q2 coils in each commutating zone is considered, the connection diagram is applicable to all intervals. The inductances are determined as a function of time from a second diagram showing the physical orientation of the elements as a function of rotor position."
"THE NORMAL FUNCTIONS of a coil or winding are obtained from the solution of the Fredholm integral equation"
"EXISTING METHODS for determining current-carrying capacity of pipe-cable systems under cyclic loading1–5 have certain limitations. Generally these methods are set up to handle the steady-state case of single-pipe systems only, although one method5 has been extended to the multipipe case and presumably the other methods could be so extended."
"The establishment of performance specifications are a necessity not only to specify anticipated performance but also to establish the limits of responsibility between the user of the device and its manufacturer. Included in performance specifications are a device's operational characteristics, its limitations, and its rating."
"SLOTS HAVE BEEN a known source of harmonics in electric machines for many years. Almost as long as engineers have been designing synchronous generators, they have attempted to suppress slot harmonics in the output waveform. Because of the complex nature of this problem most of the previous work in this field has been of an empirical or semiempirical nature. Recent developments in the digital computer field have made a direct frontal assault on this long standing problem feasible. Further, use of the digital computer makes it possible to determine the optimum machine from a fairly large number of proposed designs. The approach to this problem developed in this article is particularly designed for solution of the problem by digital techniques which can be handled by most punched-card digital computers."
"In view of the directive radiation characteristics of microwave antenna systems, co-ordination solutions on a beamwidth basis together with frequency and bandwidth should be found to provide interference-free operation for a maximum of microwave systems in various areas. Independent physical surveys and studies are recommended as desirable steps towards optimum choice of microwave system design and routing."
"INSULATION AGING DATA frequently are presented by plotting the reciprocal of the absolute aging temperature as abscissa and the logarithm of the aging time to failure as ordinate. This gives concise and useful information but often the design engineer requires this information in other forms; for example, aging at a constant temperature or perhaps at a different level of degradation."
"THREE companion papers describe impulse tests performed on the experimental transmission lines of the American Gas and Electric Company.1–3 When these tests were being planned, it was necessary to select voltage dividers capable of reducing the high-surge voltages to a level suitable for measurement by a cathode-ray oscillograph. Selecting dividers for measuring transmission-line surges is complicated by the necessity of obtaining a high divider impedance to prevent excessive reflections on the line while maintaining an acceptable divider response."
"The long-time scale model is particularly advantageous for detailed and thorough studies requiring measurements at a large number of points, with a variety of applied waves, winding terminations, and connections. Such studies are indispensable for the correct design of the insulation in modern large high-voltage power transformers. The applications of these models include design and development, improvement of present designs to establish uniform safety factors, investigation and modification of new structures and winding arrangements, and in special cases determination of which structure is best suited to meet customer specifications."
"With the large number of synthetic high polymers developed in the past 10 years by the chemical and electrical industries, a new test code, for trial use, was necessary and has been issued. Two approaches are recognized: one is a functional test on an insulating material and the other is a test on a complete insulating system. The necessity for test data is stressed."
"The term “decibel” has been used for quantities for which it is not the assigned designation. Confusion and error have resulted. To restore precision and stability to our technical terminology, it is recommended that this term be assigned specifically to unit transmission loss and that the word “logit” be used for standard magnitudes which combine by multiplication. Thus logit would serve as a companion to the word “unit” now used for standard magnitudes which combine by addition."
"The AIEE Los Angeles Section as host for the Summer and Pacific General Meeting to be held June 21–25, 1954, in Los Angeles, Calif., extends an invitation to members of the Institute and their families to meet at the Biltmore Hotel and participate in an interesting program of technical sessions, inspection trips, and social events. It is suggested that visitors combine the convention with their summer holiday since Los Angeles offers unparalleled facilities and weather for the vacationer.

"Ross D. Brown (AM '24, M '36), chief engineer, Monongahela Power Company, Fairmont, W. Va., has been transferred to the grade of Fellow in the AIEE “for his initiative in direction and engineering development of a statewide electric power system.” Mr. Brown was born in Morgantown, W. Va., December 15, 1897, and was graduated from West Virginia University in 1922 with a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering. After a few months with the General Electric Company, Schenectady, N. Y., he joined the Monongahela Power Company and predecessor companies and has been system operator, electrical engineer, and chief engineer. Some of the special engineering studies Mr. Brown has undertaken include the following: From 1926 to 1928 he applied three Klydonographs on a highly exposed H-frame 66-kv line over a period of three lightning seasons. This work pointed the way to improvements in electrical design and insulation co-ordination of wood-pole lines. From 1924 to 1937 he field tested relays by staging faults on the transmission system. These tests were effective in supplying clues to the source of undesired or improper operations of the protective system. Field tests of repeater fuses led to an understanding of the limitations of the device and assisted in its proper application. During 1946 to 1951 he served on Joint Subcommittee on Joint Use of Poles for Rural Power and Telephone Circuits under the Edison Electric Institute-Bell Telephone System Joint Committee on Plant Co-ordination. The subcommittee developed and submitted engineering specifications for long-span joint construction. Studies of effects of harmonics resulting from mine rectifier operation on local and Bell Telephone Systems have led to various designs and applications of filters to suppress harmonics propagated over an extensive 12-kv rural system. Mr. Brown is a member of Tau Beta Pi, Eta Kappa Nu, West Virginia Society of Professional Engineers, and National Society of Professional Engineers."

"A solar battery, which converts light energy into electric energy with an efficiency of 6 per cent, was demonstrated recently at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, Murray Hill, N. J. This conversion efficiency compares favorably with that of gasoline and steam engines, in contrast with other photoelectric devices whose rating is about 1 per cent."

"Now, as never before, the opportunity for professional success awaits every engineer who has the imagination and initiative to take advantage of it. In today's complex industrial society there is a dual demand for his talents, either as a creative, individual engineer, or as a manager of engineering work and the business enterprise as a whole."
"Starting with a power requirement of 225 megawatts at Oak Ridge during the war, the Atomic Energy Commission's demands on the suppliers of power will be approximately 6,500 megawatts. How the problems raised by these unprecedented demands are being solved is a tribute to American engineering talents."
"Difficulties resulting from extension of the decibel are discussed, logarithmic measurement is considered, and the term “decilog” is suggested as a supplement to the decibel."
"Alessandro Volta, a physicist whose experiments in contact-electricity led to the discovery of the voltaic cell and provided a practical source of continuous electric current, was responsible for the forward move that brought electricity from a plaything of the curious to a most important tool in the hands of mankind."
"A 100-KV D-C submarine cable, 60 miles long and weighing approximately 1,000 tons, has been laid in the Baltic Sea and will be used for transmission of about 20,000-kw d-c power between the mainland of Sweden and the Isle of Gotland."
"Flashing is one of the important considerations in the manufacture and operation of electric equipment for diesel-electric locomotives. Its importance has increased because of the large number of high-speed and high-powered road locomotives which have been put in service during the past few years. Minimization of these effects can be had by a better understanding of the basic causes of flashing."
"A low power factor has been caused in many systems during the summer months which is becoming an increasing problem in voltage regulation of distribution systems and networks. The installation of capacitors on the low-voltage side of networks is one way to increase materially the available capacity of network transformers. This and other applications are discussed together with a description of new submersible corrosion-resistant capacitors which have been designed to be suitable for application in transformer vaults."
"SHUNT CAPACITORS for supplying leading reactive kilovars for power-factor correction have been used on power systems for a great many years, but it is only recently that large shunt capacitor banks have been applied extensively to power systems at primary transmission voltages. Such applications have given rise to a requirement for satisfactory high-voltage switching equipment at minimum cost. Up until the present time the power system engineer has had but little choice of equipment other than the standard commercially available power circuit breakers for his capacitor switching applications. Such circuit breakers were designed fundamentally for the relatively infrequent interruption of system fault currents; were very often without special design considerations for interruption of capacitive currents; and were so costly as to restrict definitely the economic feasibility of many potential applications. Conversely, a capacitor switch should be designed to function satisfactorily when subjected to a very large number of routine switching operations, possibly several per day, without frequent maintenance periods; may be designed with relatively low fault-interrupting capacity, as fault protection is usually obtained by individual capacitor fuses and station bus differential; and should be designed for minimum cost to extend the range of economic feasibility of shunt capacitor installations at transmission voltages."
"This scanner overcomes the chief limitations of the lathe-type scanner. It is small, light, and flexible as to its optical system. A moving frame mount can be substituted for the typewriter-style roller when inflexible or bound copy is to be scanned."
"THE UTILITY of servomechanisms depends upon the speed, stability, and accuracy of their responses. In order to achieve the best performance, it is often expedient to employ, as a correction signal in addition to the error, either the derivative or the time integral of the error, or both. The servomechanism then is said to have derivative or integral control."
"A COMPENSATOR is a device cascaded with a control system so that the resultant output, or controlled variable, q(t) is some function of the input, or command signal v(t) (see Fig. 1). This article suggests methods for the design of several different compensators each of which contains a short-time memory unit as an integral part of its structure. The analysis is limited to the design of linear follower-type systems in which the controlled variable is required to approximate the command signal. Although electrical terminology is employed quite frequently herein, the theory is applicable to other physical systems."
"This novel article presents Park's theory in a simple form which should be of special interest to teachers and designers of rotating machines."
"THIS ARTICLE presents a new treatment of eddy-current phenomena in solid iron and other ferromagnetic alloys based upon a suggestion by A. G. Ganz.1 The new treatment is developed logically, beginning with the familiar problem of eddy currents in an infinite region of constant permeability, bounded by a plane surface where excitation is applied. The concepts of phase shift and damping always associated with the space distribution of eddy currents found in this problem are extended to the case in which a ferromagnetic material is used. This material is assumed to have infinite permeability at zero field intensity between positive and negative saturation induction, with zero incremental permeability for all field intensities different from zero. A field theory consistent with the Maxwell theory and preserving the concepts of phase shift and damping is evolved for the assumed material."
"The voltages required for perception with good contacts are low in comparison to the 120-volt house circuits and it is essential that reasonable measures be taken to control leakage currents in household appliances and electrically operated hand tools and thus prevent adverse public reaction to the increasing use of electricity in the home and in industry."
"A NUMBER OF METHODS have been described for developing a set of loss constants for a power system network with which the total or incremental losses can be calculated by matrix multiplications. These values then may be applied to the dispatching of power systems through comparisons of incremental fuel costs and incremental transmission losses. A new approach determines the per unit incremental loss incurred by increasing the generation at one plant by a small amount and reducing the generation at another plant by the amount required to maintain constant loads. This per unit incremental loss then is compared with the ratio of the incremental fuel costs of the two plants, complete co-ordination being provided by the economic balancing of pairs of plants. The two basic assumptions are in harmony with practicable power system operation."
"To determine how money can be saved on lighting, two main factors should be considered: the cost of the installation and the cost of its maintenance. The elements comprising these factors are discussed and formulas are given which should assist in the choice."
"A PHOTOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUE was used to measure ionization under impulse voltages in transformer mineral oil and in transformer Askarel (a chloro-hydrocarbon). Two electric-field conditions were investigated."
"OIL IS USED widely in electric apparatus as an insulating medium. Past investigations on the breakdown mechanisms of oil insulation generally were restricted to uniform field conditions and slow varying voltages. However, electric apparatus frequently contain some nonuniform fields and often have to pass impulse acceptance tests."
"The specific electrical tests conducted are discussed together with the results obtained. These shop tests, which agreed closely with the calculated performance, demonstrated the practicability of applying the improved cooling technique to large turbine generators."
"THE 45A 12-channel carrier system for open-wire lines is the first of a new line of carrier equipment known as the 45 class, developed for application on open-wire lines, paired and coaxial cable, and radio systems. Both electrical and mechanical design have been co-ordinated for each of the systems, and basic terminal equipment is identical for the various applications. Great stress has been placed on standardization, both to speed the development in the different areas of ultimate use, and also to increase the demand for specific items of manufacture."
"An automatic system for handling air travel reservations through the combination of a magnetic pulse storage drum and electronic digital computer equipment is described here. During 1953 the central equipment operated 99.8 per cent of the scheduled time. This reliability points to wider use of such equipment in commercial and military applications."
"IN MOST PRACTICAL situations involving sampled-data control systems, the designer has found it expedient to resort to analogue computer studies in order to determine how the transient response depends upon such factors as the sampling frequency or the velocity constant of the proposed system. The purpose of this article is to furnish a set of dimensionless curves, based upon computer studies, which are of a sufficiently generalized nature to permit approximate design criteria to be established for a wide variety of system transfer functions."
"POWER TRANSFORMERS usually are protected against damage due to internal faults by percentage differential relays, which compare currents on opposite sides of the transformer. However, when a transformer is energized, there is often an inrush of magnetizing current, which flows in only one winding of the transformer, producing a differential current which tends to operate conventional percentage differential relays. Special means, therefore, are necessary to prevent transformer relays from operating falsely on magnetizing inrush currents."
"As systems expand, the proper co-ordination of incremental fuel costs and incremental transmission losses in the economic operation of power systems becomes increasingly important. This penalty factor computer-slide rule combination offers the advantages of simplicity, ease of operation, and accurate representation of incremental fuel costs."
"SWITCHING SURGES, lightning surges, and 60-cycle voltages are, in general, the three types of voltages involved in the design and protection of insulation of stations and station equipment. Under switching surges may be classified various groups dependent upon the manner of initiation, the circuit parameters involved, and the circuit configuration. Of the numerous kinds of transient abnormal voltages caused by switching, the type receiving primary consideration in line and station insulation design has been that resulting from circuit breaker performance in the interruption of charging kva such as occurs in line or cable dropping or in switching a capacitor bank."
"THIS ARTICLE presents the equivalent circuit of JL the Schrage motor in a rationalized form. The secondary winding and the adjusting winding, instead of being represented by two parallel equivalent impedances, now are represented by a single equivalent impedance."
"The science of operations research and the tremendous advances in machine computation are two recent developments which are being utilized effectively in an analysis of an economy loading study of hydro-thermal electric systems. This research program is being sponsored by the Bonneville Power Administration at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."
"THE IMPORTANT RESULT in many studies of transient response is the maximum displacement experienced by one or more parts of the system. It is possible to calculate this maximum value directly from the system response function, without inspecting a complete plot of the response."
"THE DESIGN of electronic power transformers and other electromagnetic devices usually presents so many requirements with regard to choice of materials, thermal limitations, circuit characteristics, and insulation problems that it is difficult to obtain the best design from the standpoint of weight, volume, losses, or cost. After choices of insulating, magnetic, and conducting materials have been made, the most important requirements for an optimum transformer design are use of satisfactory proportions, selection of type of core construction, and use of an optimum core flux density."
"With the AIEE Schenectady Section as host, a very successful 3-day meeting of the North Eastern District was held May 5–7, 1954, with headquarters in the Hotel Van Curler. Built around the theme that research and engineering are the pillars of progress, 16 technical sessions on timely subject matter were held during the 3 days. The inspection trips, an evening smoker, and buffet supper followed by the Steinmetz Memorial Lecture all proved popular. A ladies' program was arranged under the chairmanship of Mrs. W. C. White. The total registration for this year's meeting was 870."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"The Student Branch Paper Prize Contest was held on Friday morning. May 7, in the Hotel Van Curler, Seven papers were well presented and the authors answered questions raised by the large audience. The chairman was George F. Steeg of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The papers which were presented during the contest were as follows."
"The Textile Subcommittee of the AIEE Committee on General Industry Applications and the AIEE Schenectady Section held a very successful conference at Schenectady, N. Y., on May 7, 1954, The conference was held in the Van Curler Hotel on the last day of the North Eastern District Meeting."
"The fifth symposium in the series of national meetings on electronic components and materials was held in the Department of the Interior Auditorium, Washington, D.C., May 4–6, 1954. Sponsored jointly by AIEE, Institute of Radio Engineers, Radio-Electronics-Television Manufacturers Association, and the West Coast Electronic Manufacturers Association, with participation by agencies of the Department of Defense and the National Bureau of Standards, the symposium was attended by more than 1,100 engineers and equipment designers from all parts of the United States and Canada."
"The board of examiners, at its recent meeting recommended the members listed for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objection to these transfers should be filed at once with the national secretary."
"When the need for extra-high-voltage cables for handling large amounts of power became apparent, a research program was undertaken at the Okonite Company to develop and build an experimental 230-kv cable. Two 500-foot pilot lengths were made, each having a different type of insulation, and a series of exhaustive tests proved the manufacturing procedure excellent. Because of these tests and other successful cables the Okonite engineers had designed, the company was awarded the contract for a 230-kv Oilostatic cable by the Canadian-Brazilian Services, Ltd., of Toronto, Ont., Canada, for installation in the Cubatao Underground Power Plant of the Sao Paulo Light and Power Company, Ltd., Sao Paulo, Brazil."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"A parachute telemetering system recently developed by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) is facilitating tests of experimental parachutes for use with modern high-speed aircraft. Electronic equipment mounted inside a parachute-borne torso-shaped dummy transmits by radio needed information — altitude, and forces at various points — in coded form to a ground station, where the information is decoded."
"A weather instrument that tells pilots what sort of weather conditions exist over runway approach zones has been introduced by Crouse-Hinds Company, Syracuse, N. Y. The new device, a rotating-beam ceilometer, registers a new cloud ceiling every 6 seconds, enabling control tower personnel to relay almost instantly to incoming aircraft the exact locations and movements of cloud or fog layers."

"ABOUT mid-September you will receive a questionnaire from AI EE. It is not a long one; just middle-sized. There are 17 “yes-or-no, and this-or-that” answers to choose and check. It should not take 15 minutes. There is also an important blank space at the end to say what is left over, if the questions do not fully bring out your opinion."
"A testimonial in appreciation of the services of H. H. Henline, who recently retired as secretary of the Institute, was presented during the Summer and Pacific General Meeting in the form of a portfolio of letters from Mr. Robertson and the other 15 living past presidents who served during Mr. Henline's tenure. The presentation was made by Past President McMillan."
"At the end of the 1953–54 administrative year, Mr. Robertson discusses some of the activities of the Institute, and of the engineering profession in general, during his term as AIEE president."
"INDUCTIVE AND CAPACITIVE unbalances are present in transmission lines which are not transposed. Because of the expense and inconvenience involved in making transpositions, it is often desirable to omit them. This is especially true of twin-conductor lines which have certain advantages at extra-high voltages. When transpositions are omitted, it is desirable to compute the resultant unbalance. Considered here is the electrostatic unbalance to ground which is a result of unequal capacitances between the conductors of the three phases and ground. The basic conductor configuration is shown in Fig. 1."
"DR. Charles Allen Thomas has an outstanding record of achievement in the fields of chemical, industrial, and atomic research. He has been president of Monsanto Chemical Company in St. Louis, Mo., since 1951 and is one of the key figures in the development of atomic energy."
"CHARLES STEINMETZ was a man whose professional accomplishments have become a permanent part of the history of science. He was a man with enormous professional stature — yet, a man whose personality contained enough warm, mischievous human quirks to make us remember h im with frequent chuckles."
"The most ambitious attempt at engineering unity thus far has been the American Engineering Council which functioned from 1920 to December 1940. This discussion of its structure and problems∗ should be of particular interest in view of the current increased demand for a unified engineering profession."
"A METHOD OF ANALYZING the induction motor speed-torque-current curves as a function of voltage is presented in this article. It is shown that the current will vary differently from the first power of the voltage; and the torque differently from the square of the voltage. The results obtained from any individual test are applicable to a specific design and cannot be considered as the correct solution for any general class of design. This method is applicable to synchronous as well as induction motors."
"Data concerning the mechanical properties of aluminum bus are supplied together with a detailed discussion of a number of recent tests and a brief summary of previous tests."
"A system where harmonics that appear on the computing voltage source of a servo analogue computer may be cancelled out in the summing network of the servo amplifier is described. This is accomplished by the injection of harmonics into the quadrature rejection circuit of the servo system."
"Frank A. Cowan of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company has been awarded the 1953 Lamme Medal “for his outstanding contributions to long distance communication and the development of modulating and transmission measuring apparatus of original design and wide application.”"
"FRANK A. Cowan was born in Escatawpa, Ala., and just 35 years ago completed one phase of his education while still a resident of the South. For this achievement he received, in 1919, the degree of bachelor of science in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Working out of Atlanta for 3 years, in the long lines department of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, introduced him to the broad field of electrical communications. An evident showing of interest in that field and of technical ability in this period contributed to an opportunity to transfer to the engineering department of long lines in New York, N. Y., in 1922."
"IT IS a great privilege and an honor to receive the Lamme Medal, and I am very grateful. Its importance is emphasized by the accomplishments of the men who have received this award in the past. To be included in this group makes me both proud and humble. Although the award is made to me as an individual, the work on which it is based would not have been possible without the help and co-operation of many people. It was my good fortune to have been associated with an organization which provided both opportunity and support. In accepting the medal, I wish to acknowledge the help of my associates who, over the years, have been a continuing source of encouragement and assistance."
"IN POWER APPLICATIONS of selenium rectifiers the reverse characteristics of the selenium cell are of interest only in so far as they affect the heat generated within the the cell and thus the efficiency and the current rating of the cell as dictated by its heat dissipation capabilities. In more critical applications, however, the detailed reverse characteristics of the cell must be considered. In such applications, not only a more complete knowledge of the reverse resistive properties of the cell is required, but also information regarding its capacitive properties."
"The annual meeting of the International Electro-technical Commission in Philadelphia this year marks the organization's 50th anniversary. This meeting, the first in the United States since 1926, will give many AIEE members the opportunity to participate in discussions of international electrical standardization."
"A MAGNETIC AMPLIFIER having a characteristic of “single-cycle” response was introduced by Ramey in which the load and control circuits are not mutually coupled in the usual sense. Instead, they operate on the magnetic state of the core on a time-sharing basis. With a rectangular flux-current loop core material, ideal rectifiers, sine-wave voltage sources, RcT = 0, and with the input signal to the amplifier of Fig. 1 a half-wave rectified sine wave, the gain in terms of average input and output voltages is just the turns ratio. Thus, by decreasing the control turns, the gain is increased. The inclusion of RcT in the circuit results in a constant voltage drop ImRcT during reset and hence a decreased resetting action. Further, since the magnetizing current which causes this drop increases as the control turns are reduced, there is an optimum number of control turns."
"Ampere established the mathematical theory of electricity and by a series of experiments demonstrated the principles of electrodynamics in adjacent current-carrying conductors. His electrical investigations were developed into an hypothesis that magnetism was essentially a phenomenon of electrified particles of matter."
"Ferrites are serving very effectively in the vanguard of communication developments. Their basic properties and methods of application are discussed which show how they have begun to revolutionize the design and manufacture of inductors and transformers."
"For optimum results a tracer control system must be designed into a machine tool — it cannot be regarded as an attachment. It must have numerous machine features added or changed to allow the tracer to perform at its best and to make the machine's operation practical from the operator's viewpoint."
"High shaft speeds, which permit direct coupling of alternators to high-speed turbines, have made the largest contribution to the increased power ratings of alternators. Consequently, high-frequency alternators are becoming widely used in air-borne equipment. These alternators should find many other applications as in computer and telemetering systems, welding applications, and arc lighting."
"The AIEE Summer and Pacific General Meeting was held in the Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, Calif., June 21–25, 1954, and was attended by 2,069 members and guests. In addition to the Annual Meeting on the first day, there were 56 technical sessions at which 237 papers were presented, these being divided as follows: 39 technical papers on communications and electronics, 24 on applications and industry, 57 on power subjects, and 117 conference papers."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"Among the technical sessions for the opening day, one of the best attended was that in which color television was considered. “Color Television Today” was the subject of the first conference paper by D. E. Foster, Hazeltine Research, Inc., of California. After explaining how the channel arrangement is like that used for monochrome operation except for the added chrominance subcarrier, the author told how the signal was encoded and then described the receiver with its decoder and the Chromatron picture tube. The prediction was made that color television receivers will be on the market in the near future with 19-inch tubes, but that relatively soon this picture-tube size will be increased by 2 or 3 inches."
"AIEE election procedure, inembersliip, new Sections, Section growth awards, rules for prize papers, student activities, and publicity were among the topics discussed at an all-day conference of Section delegates. Vice-Chairmen Bradley Cozzens (west), and Dickson Lewis (east), presided."
"An informal exploratory meeting of counselor delegates and Vice-Presidents was held on Monday afternoon with R. F. Danner, chairman of the Committee on Student Branches, presiding.

A statement of valid reasons for such objections, signed by a member, must be furnished and will be treated as confidential."
"THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers presents to the membership its 70th annual report, covering the fiscal year ending April 30, 1954. As required by the Constitution, it contains a brief summary of the principal activities of the Institute during the year, a general balance sheet showing the financial condition of the Institute at the close of the fiscal year, a statement of cash receipts and disbursements, and a schedule of securities owned. Much additional information regarding the year's activities has appeared in Electrical Engineering throughout the year."
"The 500-type telephone set, first introduced on a field trial basis in selected areas of the United States in 1948, now will be available in eight different colors. Designed as a successor to the familiar 302-type combined set, the 500 type with its improved transmission, dialing, and ringing performance characteristics has been manufactured of black plastic in the Western Electric Company's Indianapolis (Ind.) Works since 1950. To make the additional colors available to the subscriber has required months of concentrated research and study by both Bell Telephone Laboratories' and Western Electric engineers."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"A new concept of an electron tube, believed to have vast potentials, was announced recently by Sylvania Electric Products Inc. The new development, known as the “stacked tube,” is the result of several years' study by the Sylvania Research Laboratories, culminating in a development contract with the U. S. Navy's Bureau of Ships, and limited quantities are now being made at the company's Product Development Laboratories. Kew Gardens, L. I."

"THE August issue of Electricial Engineering carried on this page the announcement of a questionnaire on employment conditions to be sent to AIEE memers in continental United States about the middle of September 1954. If you were on vacation when the August issue came, your Board of Directors urges you now to read that announcement and its explanation of the project, and to resolve to give the questionnaire your thoughtful and prompt attention when it arrives in your mail. The subject of the questionnaire is one of the most important problems now before the engineering profession. It deals with the relation of the engineer as an employee to his employer. Your Board of Directors asked the Committee on Planning and Co-ordination to prepare this questionnaire, test it for clarity, and send it to all the members concerned, so that the answers might be in and available for the Board's guidance this fall. Before answering questions, there may be a few that you would like to ask; such as: “Who wants to know?” “Why do they want to know it?” and “Why can't they find out without another of these questionnaires?”"
"The university is viewed as an institution for sharpening men's intellectual abilities and focusing them on mankind's basic problems. Research seeks knowledge as a step toward understanding."
"In his address on the occasion of receiving the Eta Kappa Nu Award to the Outstanding Young Electrical Engineer of 1953, Dr. Abetti discusses the challenge, and compensations, of his work as a development engineer."
"THERE HAS recently been a renewed interest in the part-winding method of securing reduced starting current with moderate starting torque values for polyphase induction motors in sizes of 50 hp and larger. The most usual scheme is to provide the motor with two identical parallel circuits in the stator winding, and to connect only one of these circuits in each phase to the power supply for starting. After a brief interval, the remaining circuits are connected, and the motor then operates in a normal way."
"Georg Simon Ohm, a mathematician and experimenter whose analysis established the law determining the flow of an electric current in a conductor, clarified the distinction between current intensity and quantity and “resolved a subject of vast importance, and hitherto involved in the greatest uncertainty.”"
"THE INDUSTRY IS at present engaged in designing and building turbine generators in ever-increasing sizes. The operation of turbine-generator units necessitates the use of a multitude of controls."
"Differential phase-and-gain distortion in systems used for color television transmission results in distortion of the colors being transmitted. A test set, consisting of a portable transmitter and receiver, for measuring differential phase and gain is described."
"IN ORDER TO determine the future feed points that will be necessary to supply the primary system, the distribution planner must approach the problem with a realistic and logical sequence of steps. These steps would be: 1. determine the future load densities for the various areas of his system; 2. determine the number of feed points needed to supply these areas with several methods of primary feed arrangement, and 3. determine the most economical means of supplying these feed points."
"Although the need for a theory of ferrimagnetism has existed for over 2,000 years, this has only become obvious for about a decade. The importance of Neel's suggestion that possibly within a given domain not all of the magnetic ions have their magnetic moments arranged parallel to each other is discussed at some length, and the hope is expressed that in the future a ferrite may be obtained which is ferromagnetic."
"When alumina contains an alkali metallic salt, it becomes electrically conductive to a varying degree in the presence of a small amount of inflammable gas. This new detector element can detect a leakage rate of combustible gas of about one cubic inch per hour at atmospheric pressure and locate the leak."
"SINCE AUGUST of 1952 high-voltage surge studies have been in progress at the 500-kv test project sponsored by the American Gas and Electric Company. The test project is located adjacent to the Tidd power plant near Brilliant, Ohio. The surge studies were conducted as a co-operative program between the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the American Gas and Electric Service Corporation. Westinghouse supplied the surge generator and all necessary measuring equipment; American Gas and Electric erected the high-voltage bus, surge generator, and control building in addition to making the transmission lines available for the tests."
"IN SOME INDUSTRIES, the allocation of production among plants, so as to achieve maximum over-all economy, requires the consideration of seasonal variations in the availability of raw materials and product demand, and the recognition of progressive changes in production efficiency depending on past levels of production. Such is the case in a combined hydro-thermal electric system where cumulative changes in water storage elevations materially affect plant efficiencies."
"WHEN TWO or more hydroelectric storage plants are located on a river so that storage from upstream reservoirs will be used through downstream plants, certain methods of storage withdrawal will produce more energy as needed by the load than others. As the net head drops due to storage withdrawal at any plant, all natural flow water as well as remaining upstream reservoir storage then must be used at some lower averaged head, until refill is made later during a period of high river flow. Only incremental energy obtainable from storage withdrawal is used here for comparison of various methods and five components of incremental energy (ΔE) are obtained for each method. Three components are positive; plant 1 storage through plant 1, plant 2 storage through plant 2, plant 1 storage through plant 2; two components are negative; plant 1 natural flow through plant 1, and plant 2 natural flow through plant 2. The last two are obtained due to drops in head and from the total natural flow passing during the period of reduced head."
"A number of the factors affecting the breakdown of dielectrics with corona are outlined and a description of the variation of a-c dielectric strength with time of voltage application for a variety of dielectrics is presented."
"CHEMICAL TREATMENTS in porous carbon blocks from which brushes are to be fashioned often are distributed unevenly so that the final brushes do not contain the calculated percentage of treatment obtained from weight relations. In order to analyze the treatment quantitatively under small individual areas, a practically instantaneous, nondestructive method of treatment has been applied which makes use of an X-ray absorption photometer."
"The AIEE Middle Eastern District Meeting, to be held at the Abraham Lincoln Hotel in Reading, Pa., October 5–7, 1954, will have as its setting the picturesque Pennsylvania Dutch countryside.

"It is wise to have a management-development program in any organization which gives thought to its future. Engineers who attain managerial status should realize they must forego thinking as specialists and enlist the aid of those through whom they can get things done. This shift in thinking is vital."
"To better prepare the young engineers to make the transition from college to industry, new courses have been designed in which the students are assigned practical engineering projects in the fields in which they have had no previous course work."
"After World War II Japan was divided into nine sections each with its power company. In September 1952 a tenth company, controlled by the government, was formed to develop those power projects needed for the country as a whole but which were beyond the means of the individual companies to build. Power from any developed projects will go to one or more of the nine companies to market."
"IN THE FIELD of metal thickness and nondestructive plating depth measurement some need exists for a non-contacting instrument suitable for the continuous inspection of samples in motion. This article describes the basic operation of a direct reading instrument of this type for nonmagnetic metals."
"Karl Friedrich Gauss, astronomer, mathematician, and electrical experimenter, was the discoverer of the Gauss theorem in the mathematics of electricity. With Wilhelm Weber, he constructed an electric telegraph and extended data on terrestrial magnetism."
"The selection of triodes, and especially multigrid vacuum tubes, for specific applications may be systematized so that an immediate choice may be made of suitable tubes. The relation of screen-to-plate transconductance to the more commonly used tube parameters is indicated."
"This simple device, useful in solving many system stability problems, gives a clear physical picture of the performance of a synchronous machine under steady-state or transient conditions. The model permits the derivation of predetermined swing curves similar to those of Summers and McClure and offers a quick method of finding critical switching and reclosing times. Probably damping forces like effects of governors and regulators can be simulated."
"THIS ARTICLE undertakes something unique in the application of mathematical methods to the solution of physical problems. It has long been universally believed by engineers and mathematicians that if a very long and complicated problem is given, it is not possible to cut the problem into several shorter and simpler parts, solve each part separately, then interconnect the partial solutions, in order to arrive thereby at the exact solution of the original complex system itself. People always argued that it is necessary to have available the answer to the entire problem first, before an answer valid to only one portion of it may be arrived at. It was argued that one must know the effects of forces impressed at the farthest corner of an assembly, before the behavior of the nearest group could be predicted."
"THE USE OF the saturated or “Normal” form of Weston standard cell appears to be growing. Today numerous industries and college laboratories are maintaining groups of saturated cells whereas a decade ago relatively few banks existed outside the National Bureau of Standards."
"The basic formulas of the method of symmetrical components may be verified and the elliptical pattern produced by unbalanced currents can be analyzed to determine directly from the dimensions of the ellipse the magnitudes of the positive and negative sequence components by means of the polyphase oscilloscope developed at the State University of Iowa."
"The characteristics of high-coercive-force permanent-magnet alloys are reviewed and some of the opportunities and problems involved in their application are discussed."
"THE ADVENT of ultrahigh-frequency television broadcasting has accelerated development of antennas in the 500-to 1,000-mc range which direct most of the radiated energy within a few degrees of the horizon. A helically wound coil and coaxial conducting cylindrical mast has been developed which will so radiate, while giving essentially uniform patterns in a horizontal plane."
"INTEGRATION OF high-voltage systems in Great Britain has proceeded in two well-defined stages. The first occurred about 1930, with the establishment of the Central Electricity Board and the construction of a 132-kv national grid system. The second stage is now in progress, with the construction of a new 275/300-kv super grid by the British Electricity Authority (B.E.A.), set up under the Electricity Act of 1947."
"The role that high-speed rail rapid transit can play in alleviating city traffic congestion is discussed. For instance, multiple-unit train facilities can be provided in the center mall of expressway constructions at a fraction of the expense involved in building the additional highways to handle the equivalent number of people in automobiles."
"The commonly used sets of parameters are discussed briefly and it is shown how the performance of the transistor can be determined with equal facility from any of the sets that may be provided."
"THE VALUE OF automatic voltage control in maintaining maximum operating voltage and collection efficiency in gas-cleaning precipitators long has been appreciated. However, a practical system based on field investigation of actual operating requirements for optimum performance only recently has been developed."
"WITH THE AVAILABILITY of high-quality magnetic core materials, it has become possible to develop very efficient magnetic frequency multipliers. The advance of the electronic arts in the development of computers and precise control systems has created the immediate need for frequency multipliers which can produce exact multiplication of frequencies in power levels ranging from milliwatts to a kilowatt. Magnetic frequency multipliers can be made to have characteristics superior to electronic multipliers in that they use no tubes, moving parts, or rectifiers."
"THIS ARTICLE deals with the flux resetting characteristics of several magnetic materials commonly employed in magnetic amplifiers. In this study the flux was forced to change under the influence of a constant external magnetizing force. The operation of a core employed in self-saturating magnetic amplifier circuits with high-impedance control windings approximates these conditions during the nonconducting half-cycle of supply voltage. The data collected therefore are readily applicable to studying this type of magnetic amplifier."
"A novel technique of magnetic amplification is presented in which the pulse relaxation amplifier performs as a signal reset and power gain without rectifiers. Its significant application lies in a region of signal sensitivity not heretofore available in magnetic amplifiers."
"EARLY IN 1951, because of an existing shortage and the uncertain future of the supply of copper, The Detroit Edison Company began actively to consider the use of aluminum conductors in 138-kv high-pressure gas-filled pipe-type cable. For many years, the company had been employing aluminum instead of copper wherever it offered an economic advantage. In these considerations it had been felt, however, that in any change-over from copper to aluminum conductors-the field of the extra-high-voltage underground cable would be one of the last in which such a conversion should be attempted. Nevertheless, realizing that with the ever-expanding extra-high-voltage underground cable system of the company, the day might come when copper is not available for a new line or when aluminum shows a definite economic advantage over copper, the decision was made to investigate the feasibility of using aluminum instead of copper for this purpose."
"IN DEVICES such as the sweep circuits of a television receiver, it is necessary that not only the frequency of an oscillator but also its phase be controlled by an incoming signal. This article describes the design of a closed-loop system for phase control of an oscillator."
"Greatly improved measuring techniques have added new impetus to the study of ionized air and its effect on human health and comfort. Air ionization is discussed in terms of the effects of space heating and room occupancy and ionization control. Experimental work presently directed at accurately measuring ion density to provide automatic means of control is also considered."
"THIS ARTICLE sets forth the requirements to be met by an ideal superhigh-frequency (shf) relay system for a common carrier communications company's temporary use in Southern California, briefly enumerates the basic considerations prior to the decision to procure such a system, and describes the solutions to some problems encountered during the procurement process."
"BECAUSE OF THE availability of ample water power resources combined with a lack of cheap fuels the electric power supply in Sweden is based almost exclusively on water power. Of the water power resources suitable for exploitation which are now assessed at 80,000 million kwhr per annum, 15 per cent is located in the densely populated southern part of the country. The remainder is found in the northern half inhabited by only 15 per cent of population. The resources in the North are now being developed, and 75 per cent of the power produced is transmitted to the South. In 1953 1,540 megawatts (mw) were transmitted and it is anticipated that by the year 1960 the maximum capacity will be increased to 3,300 mw. The average transmission distance is about 300 miles."
"Common misconceptions both in the theory and application of the field equivalence theorems have occurred due to a misunderstanding of the role of “impressed currents” as well as the lack of a sufficiently clear and elementary exposition of the theorems. “Both are discussed here together with terminating currents and circuit analogues."
"THIS MAGNETIC AMPLIFIER has been developed to meet the need for a versatile, reliable, easily reproducible operational component for a low-level servo control system. The subject amplifier also exhibits unusual stability, linearity, and freedom from drift, which are requirements of prime importance in this particular application. The term “operational amplifier” as used herein describes an amplifier which can be used to perform various functions or operations without imposing its own characteristics on the system."
"PIPE-TYPE CABLES have in recent years become the most important means of bulk power transmission in locations where overhead lines are not permitted."
"A specific oil field is selected to illustrate the comparison of electric power costs and those of gas engine operation in another field under similar waterflood conditions. The study indicates that electric power costs have been one half the cost of fuel for gas engine operation for equal volumes of fluid pumped, while manpower requirements were reduced 20 per cent due to electrification of six out of eight waterflood projects."
"A method for shaping the characteristics of temperature-sensitive elements is described together with a practical example. The proposed method can be applied to any temperature-sensitive element provided that the coefficient of the temperature-sensitive element is larger than that of the desired characteristic and the characteristic of the temperature-sensitive element does not change with the applied voltage."
"THE INSERTION of repeaters into telephone lines to make up for circuit losses is a very common practice today. The use of negative impedance to overcome transmission loss is an old idea but only recently used to any great extent in the exchange area plant. A series type of negative impedance repeater, called the E1 telephone repeater, has found favor in the Bell System and its use has stimulated a demand for still more economical designs including a companion shunt type of negative impedance repeater. Through the use of these new E-type repeaters, it is possible to reduce the attenuation and improve the return loss of voice-frequency lines so that exchange area trunks can be used as links in a toll connection."
"CARRIER-CURRENT line traps first were proposed about 1928 as a means of reducing carrier-current signal dissipation over undesired lines of power systems. Their use for this purpose has increased steadily with the increasing complexity of the power-line circuits upon which carrier is used. That line traps have done an effective job is attested by the fact that carrier systems are functioning more economically and more reliably with the use of steadily decreasing transmitter powers."
"Chicago, the center of one of the greatest diversified industrial areas in the world, has been chosen for the 1954 AIEE Fall General Meeting. The technical program, inspection trips, and social events will occupy the entire facilities of the Morrison Hotel, meeting headquarters for the complete five days, October 11–15, 1954."

"The 22nd Annual Meeting of ECPD (Engineers' Council for Professional Development) will be held in Cincinnati, Ohio, October 28–29, 1954. Cincinnati is an appropriate location, for it was there the first pilot program of “The First Five Years of Professional Development” was inaugurated in co-operation with the University of Cincinnati and a number of local industries. Naturally, the program will be devoted to professional development, and prominent engineers, executives, and educators will discuss the various aspects. Meeting headquarters will be at the Hotel Alms."
"The Seventh annual conference on electrical techniques in medicine and biology will be held at the Morrison Hotel, Chicago, Ill., November 10th, 11th, and 12th under the sponsorship of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Institute of Radio Engineers and Instrument Society of America."

"The Materials Testing Reactor (MTR), a recent development at the Atomic Energy Commission's National Reactor Testing Station in Idaho, has the highest neutron flux of any reactor now in existence. Thirty-thousand kw of heat are produced within a space about the size of 2 large suitcases. To provide a maximum density of both fast and thermal neutrons, the Uranium-235 in the MTR must fission at a high rate, with the release of high power per gram of fuel. A flow of over 300 gallons of water per second is needed to remove the heat."

"Approximately 45 per cent of those engaged in engineering work are holders of a legal license to practice professionally, as against practically 100 per cent in all the other recognized major professions. With an awakening of professional consciousness, engineers should consider registration as an important contribution towards a greater profession."
"One of the requirements of CONELRAD is the need for notification of radio alerts and all clears by receiving radiobroadcast messages from aural and television stations. An alarm device used in conjunction with a broadcast receiver has been designed which will function automatically upon the reception of CONELRAD carrier signals."
"Michael Faraday was a chemist and electrical experimenter who discovered electromagnetic induction, the laws of electrolytic action and magnetic rotation. His discoveries led directly to large-scale electrification and electric controls in industry."
"The human factors that should be taken into consideration in designing machines are summarized and a method of applying established time study constants for the various body movements required in machine operation is considered."
"ONE OF THE principal advantages of the plug-in feature of N1, O2, and ON3 carrier system equipment is that it facilitates the normal maintenance of the systems. Thus units, which develop trouble that cannot be readily cleared on the job, may be sent to a servicing center."
"WHEN A NUMBER of d-c diesel-driven generators are used to supply propulsion power to a motor driving a ship's propeller, the generators usually are connected in series. The series system has many advantages and in most cases is the proper selection. However, there are applications where the advantages obtained by the use of parallel-connected generators more than offset the problems encountered in the use of this system. Therefore unless the answer is obvious, it is wise to study the particular system involved before making a final decision with regard to series or parallel connection of the generators."
"The two types of equipment being used to make possible the handling and viewing of radioactive materials without danger to operating personnel while conducting basic physical tests to evaluate these materials are described. Usually the heavier mechanical operations are performed under water, while the shielded cell is used for precision gauging and photography."
"FEEDBACK CONTROL SYSTEMS in which the data at one or more points are in the form of pulse trains or sequences of numbers are known as sampled-data feedback control systems. These systems are most readily analyzed1, 2 in terms of the so-called z-transforms which are the Laplace transforms of impulse-modulated time functions with the delay operator e−nTs replaced by the variable z−n."
"Test methods are recommended and described. Conclusions are drawn regarding measurements for determination of proper application of transistors to large-signal pulse circuits."
"MOST commercial wattmeters have a guaranteed limit of error of 1/4 per cent of full scale deflection on frequencies up to 133 cycles per second, but due to inherent errors this accuracy is not maintained at higher frequencies or with very low power factors. The errors referred to may be attributed to two things: the self-reactance of the voltage circuit, and the mutual reactance between the voltage coil and the current windings."
"AS THE FIRST large-scale industrial application of nuclear energy appears to be at present the generation of electric power, the electric power engineer is again being pressed by circumstances outside his control to get acquainted with a new physical science; namely, nucleonics and quantum mechanics. Three decades ago a similar situation confronted the electric power engineer when the arrival of radio forced him to study electronics and electromagnetic wave theory."
"THE BELL SYSTEM companies have installed elaborate instrumentalities for operator dialing of long-distance calls and have initiated several trials of customers dialing such calls. Under this plan, a connection is established by means of the operator's or the customer's dial to any point in the United States without the assistance of intermediate operators. Two of the prerequisites for a successful operation of this nature, a nation-wide numbering plan for the customers' telephones and a system of switching centers, are discussed from the standpoint of their application in Pennsylvania."
"Magnetostriction is discussed from the viewpoint of the problem of audio noise in inductive equipment. Certain special problems which must be considered in the application of domain theory to experimental data such as those obtained from crystal-oriented 3-per-cent silicon-iron alloys are taken up. In addition, experimental methods and results are also described."
"THE MATHEMATICAL synthesis problem in linear servomechanism design is to find the description of the system when the desired output response to a given input is specified. The desired output, however, is often defined as the “best” that can be obtained, where the word “best” has several connotations which include fastest transient response, minimum overshoot, and minimum tendency toward persistent oscillations. It is possible to apply suitable criteria and select the “optimum” response in a normalized time scale."
"WHEN TRANSFORMERS with automatic load tap-changing are operated in parallel, a method of preventing excessive circulating current is required. Some of the methods used are extremely complex requiring additional equipment as well as the use of control connections between units."
"With a view to keeping a vast network system abreast of the times, it is necessary that the question of the distribution voltage be examined on the broad basis of a fundamental plan rather than on the peculiarity of isolated loads."
"Natural noises such as “Johnson noise,” shot noise, and contact noise are reviewed. Following a discussion of noise measurement, the man-made noises such as interference signals, power hum, impulse noise, and quantizing noise are considered."
"THE CIRCUIT is shown in Fig. 1. When the load becomes inductive, as expressed by finite ratios of ωLL/RL, the control characteristic changes. This change is characterized by two features as shown in Fig. 2: 1. the control characteristic becomes shifted to the left; 2. instability, also called snap-action, occurs."
"THE COMPLETE or partial loss of the d-c supply to a large synchronous machine can have serious consequences. This may be loss of stability in the power system with the resulting major loss of service or costly damage to the machine itself. On the other hand, it is desirable to maintain the machine on the line as long as possible supplying kilowatts to the system."
"The need for faster heating methods in the steel industry can be met by low-frequency induction heating. So that full advantage of this type of heating can be taken, the heating cycle is discussed as well as the suitability of specific sizes of steel sections."
"The original electric power system is described briefly together with the modifications and extensions and a supplementary higher voltage system. The discussion of the new system includes design considerations peculiar to plants requiring a high continuity of service."
"THE Engineer Reseach and Development Laboratories (ERDL), Fort Belvoir, Va., have encountered a requirement for information on the electrical properties of low-loss core materials at low flux densities. A review of the literature revealed descriptions of three methods inadequate for the purpose."
"The properties of plasticizers and their influence on electrical compounds are reviewed in terms of plasticizer volatility and aging characteristics, plasticizer effects on resistivity of compounds, plasticizer influence on dry blending rates, and effects of clay on plasticized compounds."
"THE CIRCUIT shown in Fig. 1 is of a low-level fast-response magnetic amplifier, as developed for such low-level signals as are provided by thermocouples, strain gauges, etc. Rectifiers are not included in the input circuit, thus eliminating the restriction which they impose on the minimum signal voltage. Low drift, fast response, and high gain are obtained by the use of a combination of delayed positive voltage-current and negative current-voltage feedback. The delayed negative feedback current-voltage from a resistive load is added to the signal voltage in the control circuit of the first stage so that it amplifies the average increments of signal voltage per half cycle of power supply voltage. The positive voltage-current feedback is adjusted to just compensate for rectifier leakage and eddy current losses in the second stage. The function of the second stage is to amplify and sum the output voltage of the first stage."
"IN SWEDEN the power lines for high voltages of 230 to 400 kv cause serious interference for radio listeners living in the vicinity of the power lines, particularly in the northern part of the country where the radio field strength of the broadcasting transmitters is low. The measures formerly adopted with a view to overcoming this interference, which mainly took the form of cabling the telephone and low-tension lines and moving the aerials further away, were found to be very costly and ineffectual in many instances. A new method has now been investigated, however, which has yielded successful results. It is based on the transmission of the radio program directly over the interfering line. The principle followed consists in the connection of a radio transmitter to the power line through a capacitor located in a suitable position in the line system (see Fig. 1). The transmitter output is so selected that the signal level for the radio program transmitted over the line exceeds the interference level from the power line by such an amount that the interference is no longer perceptible. Reception can take place in the usual manner by turning the receiver to the wavelength of the power-line transmitter, with no special adjusting."
"The advantages and disadvantages of self-saturating magnetic amplifiers for use with industrial-type regulators are discussed. Some of the methods which may be utilized to overcome the undesirable characteristics of the magnetic amplifier also receive attention."
"THE EVER-increasing complexities of aircraft as dictated by operational and functional requirements make it desirable, if not necessary in certain cases, to relieve the airplane crew of manual control of many functions of aircraft operation. Particularly this is considered to be the case for certain control operations of paralleled a-c power systems. The act of synchronizing and paralleling a-c generators by manual means can require the attention of a crew member when other duties are most demanding of his time and if performed improperly may result in undesirable transients and improper operation of the system."
"WALLBOARD and plasterboard as used in the fabrication of modern homes is produced on a continuous process line. It consists of a forming station, several belt sections used for curing and drying, a live roll section used to dry the underside, a punch and knife section used to pierce holes and cut the board to length, an oven curing section, and a trimming and packaging section. In this line an upper and lower layer of paper is used to make an envelope containing a material resembling plaster of Paris. This material starts as a mud, and is cured and dryed in the process. The board is formed and cut to proper length. In order to prevent a loop from forming between belt sections or to prevent the belt sections from tearing the board, the adjacent belt sections should be controlled in speed with respect to each other to within 1 part in 3,000, or to a maximum permissible inaccuracy of 0.03 per cent."
"It is expected that last January's record registration of 5,000 members and guests will be repeated at AIEE's 1955 Winter General Meeting.

"IN regulating and control systems the quantity to be controlled is compared to a reference quantity. The difference or error is used to maintain the controlled quantity near a fixed value. Currents or voltages are often used in electric systems as reference quantities. These currents or voltages are supplied from circuits which must be unaffected by input variations or ambient temperature variations, because the controlled quantity will vary as the reference quantity varies."
"WHAT is the maximum amplitude that can be obtained in a linear time-invariant transmission or control system subjected to inputs with limited amplitude? This question is important in many physical problems. Suppose b is the bound on the magnitude of the input amplitude and h0 is the smallest number such that the response h(t) satisfies |h(t)| ≤ h0. Then the maximum response ratio r is defined by r = h0/b. With this terminology, the question becomes: What is the value of r?"

Argon was chosen as an atmosphere rather than air to simplify conditions by eliminating chemical reactions between the gas and the electrodes, and by presenting the effects of one gas rather than a mixture of gases. The electrode materials were tungsten, tantalum, molybdenun, titanium, iron, and copper, chosen to give a wide variety of properties."
"Portable transistor broadcast receivers of good quality can now be built with present experimental transistors. It is anticipated that such receivers will appear on the market as soon as transistors and other miniaturized components are available at reasonable prices."
"STARTING performance of aircraft tachometer indicators has received considerable attention with the advent of the gas-turbine engine. Military specifications are requesting lower starting indication of the tachometer indicator to better aid the aircraft pilot to start his engines properly and safely."
"A METHOD of measuring the magnetic characteristics which control the manner in which cores operate in self-saturating magnetic amplifiers is necessary both for economical production and accurate design of such amplifiers. Because of the eddy-current-type effects present, even in thin gauges of the rectangular loop magnetic materials used in cores for high-performance self-saturating magnetic amplifiers, it has not been found possible to directly relate the amplifier performance to usual d-c or a-c hysteresis loop measurements.1, 2 When operating in an amplifier, a core will generally follow a peculiar minor hysteresis loop determined by the combination of core magnetic characteristics and conditions imposed by amplifier circuitry.2 Thus to predetermine the behavior of a core, it must be tested under conditions which simulate amplifier operation."
"Great advances have been made in magnetic recording in a short period of time. At present, it is being used in the fields of computers, instrumentation, business machines, and control mechanisms. An interesting presentation is given of its development and applications."
"MAGNETIC AMPLIFIERS of the saturable reactor type are used in applications which require a substantially linear relationship between d-c input and d-c output."
"This year the Winter General Meeting will be held not only in the Statler, the headquarters hotel, but also in the Hotel Governor Clinton, New York, N. Y., January 31-February 4, 1955."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"The 1954 AIEE Fall General Meeting was held in Chicago, Ill., at the Morrison Hotel, October 11–15. The attendance at this, first of the three Fall Meetings to be held in Chicago, was 2,008 including members, students, and guests. The next two Fall Meetings in Chicago will occur in 1955 and 1956."
"An outstandingly successful 3-day technical conference of the new Petroleum Industry Committee was held September 27–29, 1954, with the Tulsa and Oklahoma City Sections as host. Three hundred eighty-nine engineers from 22 states and Canada attended this First Petroleum Industry Conference at the Mayo Hotel, Tulsa, Okla. It was acclaimed by all as filling a vital need in advancing further the art of electrical engineering through technical presentations and discussions of electrical technology and applications. Of 19 technical papers presented, one has already been accorded Transactions status, and it is expected that others will be elevated to this status upon recommendations from the committee. Seven papers were on pipe-line subjects, six on applications in production of oil and gas, four on refining applications, and two were of general interest."
"A regular meeting of the AIEE Board of Directors was held in the Morrison Hotel, Chicago, Ill, on October 14, 1954."
"The Middle Eastern District's meeting at the Abraham Lincoln Hotel in Reading, Pa., October 5–7, 1954 was outstanding from the points of view of attendance, which was 905, the high quality of the papers, and the excellent entertainment afforded members, their ladies, and guests."
"The Twenty-Second Annual Meeting of ECPD (Engineers' Council for Professional Development) was held in Cincinnati, Ohio, October 28–29, 1954, with headquarters in the Alms Hotel. The first day of the meeting was devoted to council business, meetings of the standing committees, presentation of reports, and election of officers. The second day of the meeting was devoted to a report of the Training Committee and panel discussions of the community project in professional development, which has been so successful in Cincinnati, and is headed by Professor Cornelius Wandmacher, (ASCE), through the co-operation of the University of Cincinnati, the engineering societies, and the local industries. President A. C. Monteith led off with introductory remarks, and was followed by Ernest S. Fields, chairman of the Cincinnati sponsor group, and Walter A. Draper, president of the Herman Schneider Foundation. The points of view of wellknown educators, the participating societies, and the local industries were expressed by speakers who comprised the panels. In the afternoon, a session was held on present and projected community projects in professional development. It is of intereet to note that James W. Parker, retired president of the Detroit Edison Company, was chairman of ECPD when the training program was initially launched and he was one of those who originally conceived the idea."
"The fourth meeting of the Conference on High-Frequency Measurements will be held January 17–19, 1955, in Washington, D. G. Headquarters for the conference will be the Hotel Statler. All sessions will be held in the Department of the Interior Auditorium."
"Winfred H. Stueve (M '43), consulting and mechanical engineer, Oklahoma City, Okla., has beed transferred to the grade of Fellow in the AIEE \"for contributions to the use of electric power in the petroleum industry; particularly to the movement of oil and gas through pipe lines.\" A brief biography of Mr. StueveX is given highlighting his professional achievements."
"Applications for admission or re-election to Institute membership, in the grade of Member, have been received from the following candidates, and any member objecting to election should so notify the Secretary before December 25, 1954, or February 25, 1955, if the applicant resides outside of the United States, Canada, or Mexico."
"A program of co-ordinated action by educators, engineering and scientific societies, and industry directed at improving secondary education in science and technology was enunciated recently at the fifth annual Thomas Alva Edison Foundation Institute, which was held under joint auspices of the Foundation, the Engineering Manpower Commission of Engineers Joint Council, and the Scientific Manpower Commission."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"A powerful new radar height-finder being made by the General Electric Company in Syracuse, N.Y., for the U.S. Air Force is helping to strengthen defense networks of the United States and its allies."
"Three types of instruments for measuring the thickness of electrodeposited coatings have recently been developed by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). While all three instruments depend upon the difference in electric conductivity between the plating and the basis metal, each makes use of different methods for sensing specimen resistance. Two of the instruments, the “Dermitron” and the phase-angle thickness meter, utilize electromagnetic coupling to the specimen, making use of the reflected field from eddy currents induced in the specimen. A third, a waveguide inspection tool, employs direct conductivity measurement with point electrodes. All three devices permit simple nondestructive determination of plating thickness of sample thickness for homogeneous metals. When appropriately calibrated, they can be used for measurement of magnetic as well as nonmagnetic materials."

"MANY NOTABLE engineering developments during the year 1953 have been reported by 24 technical committees in all of the five broad divisions of Institute activities."
"Grid magnetron permits greater efficiency and control in the transmission of power. This montage features a cutaway section of this new tube which holds promise of many applications impossible with the present magnetron tube"
"A general survey of recent development work on the sources of unipolar air using alpha-emitting radioactive materials is presented. A new device, which operates at relatively high air speeds of about 450 feet per minute, provides an air output containing only positive or only negative ions. The method of controlling the density of this unipolar output also is discussed."
"The best life test for fractional-horsepower motors should apply simultaneously or cyclically the major deteriorating factors to the insulation system. These are considered to be heat, voltage, vibration, and humidity. The closer the life-test cycle can match or accelerate possible service conditions, the greater value it will have."
"THE PRINCIPLES of loading generating stations according to incremental rate characteristics have been known and practiced for a number of years. More recently the effect of transmission losses upon economy loading of plants has received attention. The continued rapid growth of transmission networks and system interconnections promises to bring about increased interest and emphasis on the over-all problem of operating systems at optimum economy. This article proposes to present a summary of the problem in a manner largely devoid of abstract mathematical concepts and derivations. An effort is made to establish certain principles and criteria, mainly through intuitive reasoning."
"TO TRANSMIT electric power across rivers and other waters, submarine cables have been used for more than 50 years. A great number of various types of cables have been installed during this period. In general, submarine cables are constructed similar to the regular underground cables with added mechanical protection in the form of armor wires."
"NOT INFREQUENTLY bridges provide a means of crossing streams, highways, railroads, natural depressions, and so on, with power cables that is more economical than such alternates as submarine cable, tunnels, and underwater ductline. The number of circuits involved in the crossing usually determines whether the crossing will be an aerial cable or a conduit type of installation, and also provides a basis for determining the space and weight requirements which must be accommodated on an existing structure."
"A multipurpose instrument is described which can measure direct voltages in high-impedance circuits, small direct currents, and high resistances with good accuracy. The basic detector is a chopper-type stabilized feedback amplifier which is entirely a-c powered."
"The primary objective was to develop a laboratory test to discriminate between insulators liable to puncture and shatter and those which satisfactorily discharge the stroke by flashover and continue to operate normally after the momentary ground has been cleared. It was established that insulator failure by puncture could be obtained by repeated applications of a steeply rising voltage surge to the test specimen"
"OPERATORS OF power generating equipment realize that it is desirable from a system control point of view to have all speed governors on their interconnected systems with reasonably similar steady-state characteristics. Normal load changes then would be shared by all units in proportion to their ratings and the action of supplementary controllers would be uniform. This would result in smaller deviation of frequency and load distribution from the desired values. Most attempts to make all prime movers on a system respond to system changes in proportion to their ratings have been confined to setting all speed governors so that they have equal steady-state speed regulation. Tests show that the response of prime movers to changes in system frequency or to the action of supplementary controllers is of a random nature and has little relation to machine rating or steady-state speed regulation. This article outlines the factors that contribute to the random nature of prime mover response and indicate how testing programs for existing units, as well as future design changes of governing systems, can produce a major improvement."
"IT HAS BEEN established previously that the “firing angle” in a magnetic amplifier is governed primarily by the flux state of the core at the beginning of the gating half-cycle and that the change in the core state during the control half-cycle is fixed by the net time integral of voltage applied to the core during that half-cycle. The half-cycle response amplifier using “square-loop” material was developed in 1951 by applying this theory.1"
"IN THE ELECTRICAL industry, from the electric range in the home to the protective relay in the generating station, reliable performance of large equipments frequently depends upon the proper functioning of relatively small electric contacts. To aid in the design of one widely used contact configuration, that of a silver-surfacing layer bonded to a backing material, a fundamental investigation has been made of the factors which determine arcing life. Geometric variables include silver thickness, contact diameter, surface curvature, and backing arrangement. Electrical variables include current from 5 to 35 amperes, and voltage from 6 to 440 volts, all at 60 cycles. Kinematic variables include mechanical bouncing and contact velocity."
"This year marks the 60th anniversary of the development of power from Niagara Falls, and consequently of the electric power industry. Although there were earlier d-c and single-phase stations, Niagara was the first power utility. In recognition of this fact, and in view of recent proposals for its further development, this timely history of Niagara power is presented."
"AN ADVANCE on the original combination of electric-operated cam controller with pneumatic circuit contactors, this new system utilizes two motor-operated controllers; one to establish main circuits, and the other to commutate resistance. Refinements, introduced as the result of operating experience with equipment of the previous type, give smoother operation and improved dynamic braking characteristics. Compactness and ease of maintenance have been achieved to a marked degree."
"The power consumption in underground coal mines as related to connected horsepower for certain operations or areas is discussed. All the data presented are based upon actual tests extending over a long period of time and represent the average figures for many mines unless otherwise stated."
"BUILDING A 330-kv transmission system meant going beyond the existing frontiers and establishing equipment and design principles on an entirely new basis. To go about this job, all available information was gathered together and to supplement this information the tests at the Tidd Plant of The Ohio Power Company were initiated and carried out over a long period of years so that there would be as few questions unsettled as possible when the actual work came to be done."
"POWER CABLES undergoing daily load cycles are alternately heated and cooled, building up internal stresses which manifest themselves by the longitudinal movement of the cable into and out of adjacent manholes. This movement subjects the cable sheath to cold working ultimately causing it to fail. It is therefore desirable to determine what factors affect the cable movement, how the amount of movement may be calculated, how this movement may be decreased, and to what extent decreased movement is desirable."
"This microwave installation was installed not only to supplement existing wire line communication but also to obtain technical data regarding the reliability of a microwave radio relay system under unfavorable atmospheric conditions and terrain. The installation is described and the fading problems and their solution are discussed."
"A SIMPLE METHOD of accounting for energy transfers between systems that is being practiced by five electrical utility systems of separate ownership whose transmission lines are connected to form a loop network can be applied by any group of three or more interconnected systems. The method is applicable and advantageous particularly where natural energy flow is permitted through a network and no effort is made to control flows through any interconnection by the use of series capacitors or phase-shifting equipment. It is based upon a comparison of scheduled with actual deliveries and receipts of energy by each system through all of its interconnections with the other systems of the group. Also, it assumes that each system employs an effective means of controlling the net amount of energy delivered or received at all of its interconnections to conform with the predetermined schedules."
"Magnetic recording has shown it has great possibilities in quality and economy and the use of this facility for the sound with motion pictures is attractive. The use of 1/4-inch tape without sprocket holes is more flexible than film because of its thinness, it takes up less space, and it gives excellent quality of reproduction. Synchronization between picture and sound on the tape—an important problem—has been accomplished."
"The AIEE Winter General Meeting to be held at the Hotels Statler and McAlpin in New York, N. Y., January 18–22, 1954, will feature the largest technical program in the history of the Institute. The social activities, for which the Winter General Meeting also is known, again will be one of the outstanding features. A group of varied and interesting inspection trips has been arranged also, closely allied with the technical sessions."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"The sixth annual AIEE Conference on Electronic Instrumentation and Nucleonics in Medicine was held jointly with the Institute of Radio Engineers and the Instrument Society of America, November 19–20, 1953, at the Hotel New York erin New York, N. Y. Seventeen technicad papers were presented at four enthusiastically received sessions and a lecture-demonstrati on on cine-radiography was well at tended on the evening of the 19th."
"Editor's Note: This department has been created for the convenience of the various AIEE technical committees and will include brief news reports of committee activities. Items for this department, which should be as short as possible, should be forwarded to R. S. Gardner at AIEE Headquarters, 33 West 39th Street, New York 18, N. Y."
"The Board of Examiners at its meeting of November 19, 1953, recommended the following members for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objections to these transfers should be filed at once with the Secretary of the Institute. A statement of valid reasons for such objections, signed by a member, must be furnished and will be treated as confidential."

"Recording of television pictures on magnetic tape in color and in black-and-white was demonstrated publicly for the first time on December 1, 1953, by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) at its Princeton, N. J., laboratories in a preview of new techniques that will simplify the entire art of making pictures in motion."
"The world's most powerful radio transm it ter went into operation recently at Jim Creek Valley, Wash., in the Cascade mountains when for the first time in the nation's history the United States Navy was able to flash instantaneously a wireless message around the world directly to all of its ships and naval units."

"In this address commemorating the founding of the American Standards Association, Professor Adams, AIEE representative at the Founders' Day Ceremonies, presents some personal reminiscences of the preorganization days of the American Engineering Standards Committee, which was the forerunner of the ASA with its much broader scope."
"Thirty-five years ago—on Saturday, October 19, 1918, to be exact—a group of 15 farsighted business executives held a meeting in the Engineering Societies Building in New York City. They were representatives of the country's five leading engineering societies, and they had called the meeting to organize the American Engineering Standards Committee (AESC). Having passed four important milestones during the 35 years of its history, in this anniversary address the president of the American Standards Association points out that the ASA is now faced by its fifth great milestone—the result of the transition from mechanization to automation."
"MAGNETIC CORES with rectangular hysteresis loops are of interest to the field of digital computers because of their ability to hold, or “remember,” the direction in which they are magnetized. In digital computer terminology, a magnetic core may be said to contain a binary 0 if its remanent flux is positive or a binary 1 if its remanent flux is negative. A group of magnetic cores therefore can hold a pattern of 0's and 1's which make up a binary number."
"One of the longest and most widespread power shortages ever experienced in the United States occurred in the Pacific Northwest in 1952 due to the extended drought. The way this shortage was handled both by advance planning and later revisions as conditions changed are presented."
"The well-rounded safety program described here includes electrical and mechanical safeguards, and a continuous education and inspection program by a very active safety committee."
"A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT in the cooling of field windings of turbine generators has been developed by the General Electric Company and applied for the first time in a 125,000-kva (30-pounds-per-square-inch-gauge hydrogen pressure) 3,600-rpm turbine generator now in the Huntley Station of the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation at Buffalo, N. Y. Figure 1 shows the field of this machine. The new cooling arrangement has been proved successful in factory tests, which showed that at full 30-psig capacity, the temperature rise of the field winding is only about 25 per cent of that of otherwise duplicate fields of standard design previously tested. This indicates that for the same temperature rise, the new field could have its 30-psig capacity doubled, to 250,000 kva. Because of a requirement that the generator field be interchangeable with the fields of several previous machines of the same capacity, it was not feasible to take advantage of the improved cooling to reduce the physical size of this particular generator."
"Foreword. The summary presented here is that of the Preliminary Report prepared by the Committee on Evaluation of Engineering Education of the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE). The work of this committee over the past 18 months has been financed jointly by Engineers' Council for Professional Development (ECPD) and by the Engineering Foundation. The Preliminary Report now is being studied by institutional committees on evaluation in some 150 colleges of engineering. When the comments and criticisms from the educational institutions are received, the Preliminary Report will be revised and presented to the ASEE."
"The Nechako-Kemano-Kitimat hydroelectric power development and the power-consuming aluminum-reduction plant, at Kitimat, of the Aluminum Company of Canada, Ltd., the Canadian production subsidiary of Aluminium Limited, are located in the Coast Range country of British Columbia, with water access about 500 miles from Vancouver and 180 miles from Prince Rupert."
"The self-propelled rail car is returning to a place of popularity as the railroads seek to reduce costs and attract additional passenger business. Current rail-car applications in the United States cover relatively long main-line runs with diesel-hydraulic cars and branch-line service with light diesel-electric cars. Between these two extremes there exists a need for a main-line type of car capable of performing surburban service. Certain electric drive characteristics are well suited to this application."
"PRACTICALLY ALL of the telephone switching equipment in an automatic exchange is made up of wired assemblies of relays and other components interconnected by a multiplicity of wires. Many of these assemblies are made up of smaller components called “relay circuit units.” These vary in size, and after testing, are mounted in larger frameworks. A careful check of connections and electrical continuity is essential to assure that these units will function properly when connected to other circuits in a telephone exchange."
"THE LATEST ADVANCE in the automatic handling of toll telephone calls is the 4A Toll Crossbar Switching System. The heart of this system is the card translator. In it is stored the necessary information to route a call to any one of the toll or local offices in the United States and Canada. Its operation is based on selecting a pattern of light beams corresponding to the routing information required. Determination of the routing information is made by detecting which light beams, called channels, are present during each translation."
"THIS ARTICLE extends a previous study1 to include hydroelectric power generating areas. As before, the object is to determine theoretically the best values of controller gains; that is, to find those controller settings that will result in best over-all system performance."
"Emphasis is placed upon making a careful accurate evaluation of all the cost factors involved in investment cost, operating cost, and lost-production cost due to down time to determine the most economical and efficient type of prime mover to operate beam pumping wells."
"WITH THE ADVENT of the type N carrier telephone system1 about 3 years ago providing high-speed temperature-stable economical telephone circuits over the shorter cable network, it became very desirable to adapt the type N system to the transmission of both Schedule A and C programs. The flexibility of the proposed arrangements, the economics envisioned, and the increasing difficulties of meeting requirements such as high speed of propagation for the sound channel of television circuits with voice-frequency loaded cable were all factors contributing to the decision to provide program transmission over type N carrier."
"THE DETROIT Committee on Electrolysis is a voluntary organization of companies and municipal departments constituted for finding the best engineering solution to the electrolysis and corrosion problems confronting its members. It is typical of active electrolysis committees in more than 25 cities and areas in the United States and Canada. The detroit committee on electrolysis was organized in 1922 and it has functioned without interruption from that date to the present time."
"THE MAP METHOD is a scheme for simplifying the derivation of logical forms for digital control and computing circuits. It comprises a number of improvements and extensions of a procedure suggested by E. W. Veitch,1 who pointed out that each logical function may be represented uniquely by a rectangular array, the pattern of which leads to the synthesis of a simple, Boolean algebraic representation."
"This pilot-wire relaying scheme has been designed to take advantage of the product characteristic of the type CFD relay. It operates as a variable percentage differential relaying device on light fault currents and for all practical purposes as a phase angle comparison scheme on heavy fault currents."
"Although the joint use of wood poles by supply and communication companies has been established practice for well over 50 years, changing technologies in both the power and telephone fields has necessitated continuous review to provide successful co-ordination of facilities on the same pole line. The problems introduced by higher supply voltages are discussed."
"IT IS WELL KNOWN that the most efficient operation of a power distribution network is obtained when the power factor of the load throughout the network is approximately 100 per cent. Transmission lines, however, when operated at the loads and voltage levels of maximum economy, require large amounts of reactive kilovolt-amperes (kvar), particularly at the load ends. The generator-end component of this reactive usually can be supplied most economically by the generators."
"IN THE ENGINEERING studies of a possible installation of submarine cables at some depth below the Baltimore Harbor, data were required on thermal diffusivity and variations of ambient earth temperatures at various depths throughout the year. From measurements over a 20-year period, certain facts about the general character of the temperature variation of the water at the bottom of the Baltimore Harbor are known: (1) The average annual water temperature at the bottom of the harbor, is within a few degrees of the average annual air temperature in Baltimore. (2) The water temperature closely follows in magnitude, but lags behind the mean daily air temperature."
"D-C POWER is required in many industrial, mining, and railway applications. Most of the d-c power for these applications is provided by mercury-arc rectifiers. A relatively small percentage of d-c power is provided by rotary converters and motor-generator sets. Direct voltages ranging between 250 and 3,000 volts are used for these applications."
"Although automatic protection of electric equipment has been standard practice for many years on electric power systems, it has not been applied as often to turbines and boilers in central stations. Its extension to the entire boiler-turbine-generator unit is described here."
"LONG ISLAND Lighting Company placed in service in November 1952 an outdoor 90/99-megawatt turbine-generator unit at Glenwood Power Station Number 3. This is the first of three similar units which will almost double the installed capacity by the end of 1954. Two of these machines are located in a new station at Glenwood Landing on the North Shore of Long Island, see title picture, and a third in a new plant at Far Rockaway on the South Shore."
"MANY DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS are fed essentially from one high-voltage system through transformation. It is sometimes desirable to ground both systems at the substation which is the main source of supply to the distribution system. This grounding problem may be solved by using either a Y-Y-delta transformer with a tertiary delta winding or a conventional Y-delta bank with a separate grounding transformer. However the tertiary delta winding in the first case and the zigzag windings of the grounding transformer in the second, both remain idle under normal load conditions. In addition, a separate grounding transformer is a source of permanent no-load losses, and it requires space and extra equipment in the switchyard. The higher initial and operating costs inherent in these schemes are reduced by the use of a delta-grounded power transformer, first suggested by H. L. Hoeppner.1"
"The problems, equipment requirements, survey procedures, and record presentation involved in conducting a very-high-frequency radiation survey are presented together with the conclusions reached as a result of the project."
"THE BONNEVILLE POWER Administration has adopted 345 kv for transmitting large blocks of power in the Pacific Northwest. The high initial investment required to transmit power at the higher voltages dictates the necessity for closely engineered practices. Revisions in practices that have resulted in lower costs for the 230-kv grid will be adopted for the 345-kv circuits and include: (1) reduced insulation levels, (2) high-speed automatic switching, (3) reduced lightning arrester levels, (4) elimination of provision for continuous overhead ground wire, (5) use of large single-phase autotransformer banks, and (6) elimination of spare single-phase transformers."
"THE APPLICATION OF direct current to the stator of a 3-phase induction motor long has been recognized as a means of producing a retarding torque on the moving rotor. Methods have been given for evaluating the average braking torque, but a simple means for determining the complete speed torque curve during braking will be of value for the control engineer."
"THE TYPE N system, introduced into the field some 3 years ago for short-haul toll telephone service, provides flat regulation for the group of 12 channels at each repeater and the receiving terminal, and individual channel regulation at the terminal only. Up to about 150 miles this regulation has been ample. Although the flat regulation is adequate beyond that length, the transmission variations caused by temperature changes may exceed the regulating ability of the individual channels. To prevent this condition a deviation regulator has been designed for insertion into the high-frequency line at appropriate intervals. Systems long enough to require a regulator have certain transmission advantages when using a recently developed channel 13 so that the regulator is activated by the 12 channel carriers, 2 to 13. The regulator determines the departures for each channel carrier from its nominal, and regulates the line transmission by networks so as to produce a minimum residual. The regulator is shown schematically in Figure 1. It connects to the output of a low-high repeater, and consists of four main blocks as indicated by the dotted lines: the thermistor controlled shaping networks, the regulator amplifier, the channel filter bank, and the computer and four control circuits."
"BOOLEAN ALGEBRA may be utilized in the design of electronic switching circuits by a method analogous to that applicable to the synthesis of relay switching circuits. This method involves the interconnection of idealized 2-valued elements to form circuit arrangements fulfilling the original design requirements."
"THE DIFFICULTY in comparing the ratings of European and American power circuit breakers results from differences in the methods of stating the interrupting rating. The rms value of a short-circuit current usually varies with time. Its maximum value occurs at the initiation of an asymmetrical short circuit and is the value of current which must be closed or carried by the breaker. The currents to be interrupted include those which are initially asymmetrical and which at contact parting still may have appreciable asymmetry. Consequently the ratings must state the ability of the breakers to close or carry and to interrupt both symmetrical and asymmetrical currents."
"Of all man's resources, time is the most perishable. The manager who knows how to spend his time is likely to manage well, for how he utilizes his other resources depends to a very large extent on how he utilizes his time. Four basic rules are discussed."
"The Eastern Joint Computer Conference, which was held in the Statler Hotel, Washington, D. C., December 8–10, 1953, had as its theme, “Information Processing Systems—Reliability and Requirements.” More than 1,000 engineers attended the six technical sessions and visited the elaborate exhibits of nearly 40 manufacturers displayed in three rooms adjacent to the ballroom. Seven inspection trips to nearby Government bureaus and laboratories were made where computers are functioning. On Tuesday evening, a reception and cocktail party was held for all registrants and their guests in the Presidential Room of the headquarters hotel. In addition to the AIEE, the sponsors were the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) and the Association for Computing Machinery."
"The regular meeting of the AIEE Board of Directors was held in the Hotel Phillips, Kansas City, Mo., on November 5, 1953."

"P. A. Abetti, (AM '49), Power Transformer Engineering Division, General Electric Company, Pittsfield, Mass., has been selected as the nation's outstanding young electrical engineer for 1953 by Eta Kappa Nu Association. Mr. Abetti was chosen for “his original approach to power transformer design through the creation of unique electromagnetic models and his exceptional civic and cultural attainments.” Mr. Abetti will receive his award at a dinner during the Winter General Meeting of the AIEE. Born February 7, 1921, in Florence, Italy, Mr. Abetti came to the United States in 1946. In Italy he studied at the University of Florence, the Polytechnical Institute of Turin, and the University of Pisa, receiving a doctor of engineering degree in 1946 from Pisa. He continued his studies in the United States at the Illinois Institute of Technology where he received a master of science degree in 1948 and subsequently received a doctor of philosophy degree in 1953. Mr. Abetti joined the General Electric Company in 1948 and is employed in the advance and development engineering subsection of power transformer engineering. In addition to his work at the company, he also teaches graduate courses at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, N. Y., and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge. Mr. Abetti received the Coffin Award from General Electric in 1953 for his work in electromagnetic models of power transformers. He is a member of Eta Kappa Nu, Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, and is serving on the AIEE Committee on Basic Sciences (1953–54)."
"Robert Andrews Millikan (M '22, HM '33), professor emeritus of physics and vice-president, Board of Trustees, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, died December 19, 1953. Dr. Millikan had received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1923 for his work in isolating and measuring the electron, and for his researches on the photoelectric effect. Dr. Millikan was born in Morrison, Ill., March 22, 1868. He received his bachelor of arts degree from Oberlin College in 1891 and his masters degree in physics from the same school in 1893. He received the award of a fellowship at Columbia University, where the doctor of philosophy degree in physics was conferred on him in 1895. Then he studied for 2 years in Berlin and Goettingen Universities in Germany. He was assistant in physics, University of Chicago, Ill., 1896–97; an associate in 1897–99; an instructor in 1899–1902; assistant professor in 1902–07; associate professor, 1907–10; and professor from 1910 until 1921. He had served as as director of the Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics and as chairman of the executive council of the California Institute of Technology from 1921 to 1945. During World War II his scientific work on rocket and jet propulsion development won him the Presidential Medal of Merit. Technically retired as head of the California Institute of Technology in 1946, he had continued to make contributions to cosmic-ray studies. These studies made by Dr. Millikan aroused a universal interest. He started his researches on the phenomena in 1915. His theory on cosmic rays was that they originated from the interstellar spaces and were the “birth-cries” of new atoms of heavier elements such as iron, oxygen, and silicon, being created from the lighter ones, such as hydrogen and helium. In addition to the Nobel Prize, Dr. Millikan had received the Edison Medal from the AIEE in 1922, the Hughes Medal of the Royal Society of Great Britain, 1923; Faraday Medal of the London Chemical Society, 1924; Gold Medal of The American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 1926; the Franklin Medal of the Franklin Institute, 1937; and many others. He held honorary degrees from most of the leading universities and colleges in this country. He was a commander of the French Legion of Honor and a member of leading scientific socities in the United States and in Europe. He was the author of 18 books and a large number of contributions to scientific publications. He had served the AIEE on the Committees on the Edison Medal (1923–28, 1934–40) and Electrophysics (1923–30)."
"The Board of Examiners at its meeting of December 17, 1953, recommended the following members for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objections to these transfers should be filed at once with the Secretary of the Institute. A statement of valid reasons for such objections, signed by a member, must be furnished and will be treated as confidential."
"VOLSCAN, developed in secrecy over the past 5 years, is an automatic electronic system for bringing aircraft into a base at precise intervals of 30 seconds. In thousands of flight tests with many types of jet and propeller-driven airplanes during the past year, the system has proved to be the long-sought means of eliminating the “stacking up” of planes over busy military and civilian airports. Airport traffic controllers at most bases today often are forced to delay aircraft for long periods of time because manual systems can control, at the most, 40 aircraft per hour."

"An instrument that provides rapid, automatic processing of information into a form suitable for direct input to large-scale electronic computers has been developed by M. L. Greenough, H. D. Cook, M. Martens, and associates of the National Bureau of Standards(NBS)at there quest of the Bureau of the Census. Named FOSDIC(Film Optical Sensing Device for Input to Computers), the machine reads marks on microfilmed copies of documents that have been marked with an ordinary pencil or pen, and then processes the information into electric pulses which are recorded on magnetic tape for direct input to an electronic computer such as the Census Univac. FOSDIC is designed to reduce the work that now is involved in converting written records into a medium acceptable as input by data-processing machines. This is particularly true since FOSDIC allows considerable freedom in design of the documents and does not require the use of any special writing instrument."
"Development of a new type of transistor which out-performs all transistors currently in use for both mil itary and civilian equipment, was announced recently by Philco Corporation."
"An engineering team from the Radio marine Corporation of America has just returned from several experimental trips during which are volutionary new electronic fish-finder was tested. Reports prove that the fish-finder, Fischlupe, locates fish, spots underwater hazards that hang fishing nets, aids navigation, and functions as a nunderwater depth indicator."

"Although in these busy times the Institute is faced with an ever-increasing variety of problems, its most important function is still its technical activity. In his Winter Meeting address, AIEE President Robertson discusses the evolution of this activity during the past 30 years."
"In today's business and industrial world, the role of the manager has assumed an increasing importance so that the choice of men who will attain managerial positions no longer can be left to chance. A management development program as instituted in one company is discussed as an example which should provide both short-range and long-range benefits."
"The cross-field generator or Rosenberg dynamo, invented early in 1904, still is used for many purposes. Some of the illustrations, actually reproductions of ones first published almost half a century ago, will seem like repetitions of those in recent publications."
"Electronic computers need a display apparatus which will record large quantities of output data rapidly. An optical system in which the output characters are displayed on the screen of a cathode-ray tube has been developed and is offered as an output for computers and other devices."
"AN ECONOMIC DESIGN of pipe-type feeder has as small a pipe and as long a section as good engineering permits. Minimum pipe size must be large enough to insure that the top conductor, when in triangular formation, will not press against the pipe. If a clearance of 0.25 inch is calculated, using a conductor size with maximum tolerance, it is assumed that clearance is assured."
"WHEN PLANNING to use power-line carrier to transmit intelligence between various stations on a power system, a logical approach to the problem is as follows."
"“for his contributions to the fundamentals of transformer design, his invention of the Klydonograph, his contributions to military computers, and for his broad understanding in the training of young engineers” BY TRADITION, the chairman of the Edison Medal Committee has only a simple duty to perform on these occasions. He is expected briefly to remind the assembled company of the origin and purpose of the medal but to leave the speechmaking to others. I hasten to assure you that I am thoroughly in accord with that tradition."
"JOHN Findley Peters is an eminent consultant and a brilliant mathematician, but above all he is an engineer. His varied engineering contributions have ranged from improved transformer design to air-borne fire control, and more recently an ingenious liquid metal pump for atomic power plants."
"THANK YOU for this award of the Edison Medal for 1953. It is with a mingled feeling of warm appreciation and deep humility that I accept and shall always cherish this honor that the members of my Institute have so graciously conferred upon me."
"THE RESPONSE time of a magnetic amplifier is defined as the time required for the rms or rectified average value of output current or voltage to change a prescribed percentage of the difference between the corresponding initial and final steady-state values. When the magnetic characteristics of the core materials approach the rectangular B-H loop shape, the waveform of the output current exhibits the typical rapid rise as one core saturates at some angle αMA and sinusoidal form after saturation, until the end of the half cycle. Under these conditions, the peak value of load current is independent of the average or rms value when αMA≤π/2."
"ANEW AND MORE powerful unit has been added to a line of pneumatic operating mechanisms for power circuit breakers to meet the requirements of a 330-kv 25,000-mva breaker.1 Three of the largest available mechanisms,2 each operating a single pole, would have supplied the necessary power but required the solution of problems of synchronization and interlocking. Consequently, a new mechanism which can operate all three poles in the conventional manner was developed. It has many of the features proved to be effective and desirable in the rest of the line and can operate breakers requiring a closing effort of 160,000 inch-pounds."
"A simple resistor-capacitor circuit permitting a visual indication of phase difference between two voltages on a cathode-ray-tube screen is presented. The phase angle is related to the orientation of a straight-line image on the screen. As the angle is changed, the line image rotates through an angle equal to twice the change. An angle scale can be put on the screen with angles up to 360 degrees shown on each side of the screen so the phase angle can be read opposite either end of the line image."
"A STUDY OF THE flow of electromagnetic energy in a typical somewhat idealized d-c generator is carried out on the basis of the electromagnetic field analysis in the machine, in the hope that it will afford a better understanding of d-c machines from an analytical and educational standpoint, and that it may be of value in improving their design. Relatively few authors have considered problems in electric machinery on this basis.1–3"
"GROUNDING OF high-voltage stations usually is accomplished by a number of driven ground rods. However, when rocky ground makes this impractical, other methods must be used such as burying a number of conductors in a criss-cross fashion at a depth of from 1 to 2 feet parallel to the surface of the earth without using any driven rods. This not only effectively grounds the electric system, but has the added advantage of controlling the voltage gradients at the surface of the earth during faults. A measure of the effectiveness of a grounding grid is given by the resistance that current encounters in flowing from the buried grid conductors into ground. The allowable value of the resistance to ground will depend upon the single line-to-ground fault current at the switchyard concerned. Various design factors of the grounding grid influence its resistance to ground."
"THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS of heat conduction become exceedingly complex for all but the most elementary systems, and in the practical case recourse must be had to numerical or experimental solutions. One such experimental method is to make use of the similarity which exists between the equations of heat flow and the equations of the flow of a unidirectional current in a mesh consisting of resistance and capacitance. In both cases, the quantity of flow depends upon the magnitude of the potential in the direction of flow and upon the conductivity of the medium supporting conduction. In both cases, also, there is a transfer of energy. However, in the thermal system, the thermal conductivity is a function of the magnitude of the applied temperature, while in the electric system, the electrical conductivity is normally independent of the voltage provided, that is, interest is confined to true conductors, and the physical system is ventilated. There is a correspondence too, between the thermal energy stored in the medium and the electrostatic energy stored in a capacitance, for the quantity of heat or electricity stored is simply equal to the product of capacitance (thermal or electrical) and potential."
"This new capacitor bank, which can be operated up to 65,000 kvar, has widened considerably the range of testing possible in the high-power laboratory. In this way it furnishes facilities in line with the electrical industry's rapid growth."
"THE USE of 330 kv as a system voltage involves many problems, and the experimental equipment and line installation by the American Gas and Electric Service Corporation at their Tidd Plant resulted in new ideas and data for solutions to corona, insulation, line loss, protection, and other problems."
"IN 1932 THE type of feeder now known as “high-pressure pipe-type cable” was first installed in the United States and was followed by a few similar installations in the years prior to World War II. The successful experience record on these pipe cable feeders resulted in a large swing to this type of transmission circuit when the termination of World War II made materials available for the tremendous utility system expansion which was required."
"Insulation co-ordination is a major consideration in the cost and design of a complete electric power system and of all individual pieces of apparatus. Basic impulse levels have been standardized so that apparatus and protective equipment can be co-ordinated. These levels are measured by withstands on specified test waves. Depending upon the type of protective device and the physical arrangement of the station, short-time voltage surges having crests above the basic impulse level may be present and will require special consideration to insure insulation co-ordination."
"The performance of electron tubes in various types of military equipment in both land-based fixed communications and ship-borne equipments is discussed after summarizing the methods of collecting data."
"PREPARATORY WORK and preliminary design on an air switch to meet the 330-kv American Gas and Electric system requirements began several years ago while the general insulation problem of the system was being studied. After the 1,300-kv level, a stack of insulators seven high was selected for the switch; many preliminary tests were made on the stack. Various combinations of insulators were tested for strength and deflection and comprehensive corona and radio noise tests were conducted. Various switch types, vertical break, horizontal break, single break, double break, and multiple break, were studied and the vertical break chosen. However, if voltages are carried to any considerable distance beyond 330 kv, some sort of split-blade switch can be expected to reduce the extremely long blade length."
"IN dealing with electric equipment, the engineer is concerned with three basic components that constitute the end product, namely: mechanical and structural parts, electric conductors, and electrical insulating materials. It is this latter element that challenges the ability of the electrical engineer and chemist, in the development of insulating materials that will improve in reliability with the concurrent development of materials intended for long life at elevated temperatures. Whether or not the performance for which the insulation is designed can be realized during industrial production must be determined by adequate test methods standards."
"THE introduction of many new insulating materials in recent years has led to the realization that the present national and international insulation temperature standards are not only inadequate, but difficult to interpret and often lead to ambiguities. This has resulted in relatively recent decisions to revise not only our own but also the international insulation temperature standards. In the United States, the present version of AIEE Standard No. 1, covering the “General Principals Upon Which Temperature Limits Are Based in the Rating of Electric Machines and Equipment,” dates back to the 1930's except for some revisions and additions in 1947. The definitions for the various insulation classes (Classes O, A, B, and C) originally were written around two broad chemical groups of materials, namely, “organic” and “inorganic” materials. With the development of silicone and fluorocarbon materials another insulation class (Class H) was added in 1947. Its definition was written around what might be called these “organo-inorganic” materials. The problem of developing more accurately evaluative standards for electrical insulation, especially with respect to temperature limitations, has become of international importance. These three articles deal with this situation. The activities of four groups working on the several phases of insulation evaluation in the U. S. and the International Electrotechnical Commission's actions are reviewed. The principles upon which test methods should be based also are discussed in some detail and the value of working towards temperature classification by functional test is stressed."
"METHODS for determining the temperature resistance of insulating materials used in electric equipment always have presented problems, which are the more difficult because they lie in the nebulous area between electrical and material engineering. Recently, the rapid chemical development of insulating materials and the increased need for their efficient use in electric equipment has led to new proposals for the temperature classification of insulating materials."
"THE CONSTRUCTION of a fuel-electric generating station at Toronto, Canada, by The Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, made it necessary to incorporate additional power into the existing 115-kv transmission system. Due to congested conditions in portions of this area, erection of steel tower transmission lines was not practical."
"THE RAPIDLY INCREASING demand for circuit breakers with extremely high interrupting capacities has resulted in the development of the 10,000-megavoltampere (mva) 138-kv 3-cycle oil circuit breaker which is described. The short-circuit current requirements of the new rating surpass those previously encountered at the higher transmission voltages including the 10,000-mva rating at both 161 and 230 kv. However, these and all other specifications have been met successfully with the breaker illustrated in Fig. 1."
"One method of providing an intermediate step between the performance, cost, and complexity of overcurrent and conventional 3-zone distance relays is described here. RELAY APPLICATION naturally varies widely with the practices of the various operating utilities. However, it seems to be a general trend that for low-voltage short lines, simple overcurrent relays are employed most commonly, while for longer moderate- to high-voltage lines a high-speed form of protection is used such as high-speed distance relaying. Modern high-speed 3-zone distance relaying is necessarily more complex and expensive than overcurrent relaying, and, while the fine performance of these relays might be considered desirable for intermediate-voltage lines, cost factors may swing the balance to straight overcurrent relaying. One method of providing an intermediate step between the performance, cost, and complexity of these two basic forms of relaying is described here. A previous article1 has described another scheme for providing distance relays economical for use on subtransmission lines."
"A method of using short-wave radio (microwaves) and waveguide components for observing and recording the surface irregularities of commutators and slip rings during the operation of the associated machines is presented. If reasonable care is exercised, measurements of surface irregularities in the order of 1/2 mil or less may be obtained."
"After pointing out what an important factor no grounding or inadequate grounding has been in electrical work injuries, the components of an equipment grounding system are discussed. Then the grounding of power station and distribution equipment, stationary utilization equipment, and portable equipment are considered."
"THE SUBJECTS OF control, protection, and accessories, as related to steam turbine-generator sets, are discussed. These subjects are usually treated on a piecemeal basis of describing either turbine or generator controls alone."
"Results of wind tunnel tests on an experimental radar antenna are presented. The torque required to rotate the antenna was seen to vary with the azimuth position, the elevation angle, the pivot location, the rotating speed, and the wind velocity. A correlation of the data based on dimensionless parameters was found."
"During the week of January 18–22, 1954, the largest Winter General Meeting program in the history of the Institute took place with headquarters in the Hotel Statler. Altogether 183 Transactions papers and 230 conference papers were presented in 95 technical sessions. Over 100 committee meetings were also held during the week. Overflow sessions were in the Hotel McAlpin. The smoker was held at the Hotel Commodore on Tuesday evening and the dinner-dance in the Ballroom of the Hotel Statler on Thursday evening. A number of inspection trips to places of interest in the city and vicinity were arranged during the days and theatre tickets to popular shows were made available to out-of-town members. The total registered attendance was 4,958, which represents a 6 per cent increase in the record attendance of 4,676 for the previous year. The attendance at the Winter General Meetings over the past five years is shown in Table I together with the membership growth and the number of papers presented each year. Excellent arrangements were made by the Winter General Meeting Committee under the chairmanship of C. T. Hatcher."

"Pier A. Abetti (A M '49) of the Power Transformer Engineering Division, General Electric Company, received the Eta Kappa Nu Award for the outstanding young electrical engineer of 1953 at the Annual Recognition Dinner held on January 18. Honorable mention was awarded to Dr. John E. Jacobs of the General Electric X-Ray Research Laboratories in Milwaukee, Wis., and to A. G. Kegel (A M '48) of the Air Arm Division of the Westinghouse. Electric Corporation in Baltimore, Md."
"Many aspects of Section activities were discussed in an informal meeting of members of the Sections Committee and Section representatives which was held on January 19. The meeting was opened by the presiding officer, W. R. Hough, chairman of the Sections Committee, who explained that the informal meeting was exploratory in nature with a view toward determining subjects for the agenda of the Section Delegates Conferencetobeheldduringthe1954Summer and Pacific General Meeting in LosAngeles, Calif."
"At the Wednesday evening Forum of Technical Committee Chairmen, L. F. Hickernell, chairman of the AIEE Committee on Technical Operations, presented AIEE President Elgin B. Robertson, who reiterated his belief in the Forum saying he was certain good will come from its conclusions if good engineering sense is used, nomatter what new faces appear on the Board of Directors."
"The regular meeting of the AIEE Board of Directors was held at Institute headquarters, New York, N. Y., on January 21, 1954."
"J. K. Nunan (AM '39, M '47), executive vice-president, Consolidated Vacuum Corporation, Rochester, N. Y., has been elected president of the company. Mr. Nunan was named executive vice-president of the firm early in 1953. Prior to becoming associated with Consolidated Engineering Corporation in February 1952 as vice-president in charge of sales, Mr. Nunan was employed by Howard Hughes, acting on direct assignment in matters relating to Hughes Aircraft, Hughes Tool Company, RKO-Radio Pictures Corporation, and Trans World Airlines. Before joining the Hughes organization, he served as general manager of the motion picture department, Ansco Division, General Aniline and Film Corporation, successfully introducing the Ansco color process to the motion picture industry in 1936. A former assistant dean of engineering and assistant professor of electrical engineering at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, Mr. Nunan was an electrical engineering graduate of that university and subsequently was awarded a masters degree in electrical engineering from California Institute of Technology. During World War II, Mr. Nunan was awarded the Medal for Merit for his work on submarine development and as director of the Pearl Harbor Laboratory of the Columbia University Division of War Research. He is a member of Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, and Eta Kappa Nu and has served on the AIEE Committee on Electronics (1948–50)."
"The Board of Examiners at its meeting of January 14, 1954, recommended the following members for transfer to the grade of membership indicated. Any objections to these transfers should be filed at once with the Secretary of the Institute. A statement of valid reasons for such objections, signed by a member, must be furnished and will be treated as confidential."
"The new Life-Line-A integral-horsepower induction motor is the product of long-range programs of research and development as announced by F. C. Rushing, manager, motor engineering, Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Some of the new features are results of more than 10 years of development, and none stem from short-term, concentrated development programs. All conform to the new suggested National Electrical Manufacturers Association standards which call for smaller motors per horsepower. In addition, there are to be found improvements in insulation, a more efficient and better protected bearing, an improved ventilating system, and quieter operation."
"Provides a notice of upcoming conference events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"A 3-day conference on radio astronomy, jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and the California Institute of Technology, was held in Washington, D. C., at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, January 4–6, 1954. The conference was called for the purpose of discussing the current status of research in this country and abroad, the nature of the problems facing radio astronomers, and profitable directions for future work in the relatively new field of radio astronomy. Investigations of invisible radiations in the radio range coming from the sky became an especially promising new method of attacking astronomical problems after ultrasensitive short-wave receivers were developed during World War II."

"This first issue of the TRANSACTIONS is a sign that the Professional Group on Nuclear Science has come of age and is ready to take its place as a responsible organ within the body of the parent organization, The Institute of Radio Engineers. The Institute set up the Nuclear Science Committee shortly after the war, to provide a forum for those engineers and scientists who worked in the new and rapidly developing field of nuclear technology. The Nuclear Science Committee gave rise to the Professional Group on Nuclear Science, which, as one of the first, did much to develop the concept of professional group structure within the I.R.E."
"Safe startup and operation of the nuclear reactor require neutron-sensing instruments to cover a range of about 109. This coverage is obtained by a counting rate meter, a period meter, and a high level power indicator. At normal operating levels, the reactor is regulated by the high level power controller and protected by the high level trips. Emergency shutdown of the reactor can be initiated by any one of 54 different conditions. Since these safety circuits are almost 100% “fail safe”, careful design, good maintenance, and cautious operation have been necessary to avoid accidental shutdowns. The period trips and high level trips are provided in triplicate for safety and are coincidence-connected in pairs to guard against accidental shutdown. The use of suppressed-zero circuits has proved helpful. The theory of coincidence-connected trips is briefly discussed."
"Most nuclear power plant designs involve the transmission of heat from the core of a nuclear reactor to the boiler of a steam plant by a gas or liquid coolant. A primary function of the power plant control system is to control the temperature of this coolant to provide the desired heat transfer rates and temperature levels in the boiler and reactor. The control system must also prevent transient excusions in the coolant temperature from exceeding the material and structural limitations of the power plant. Major obstacles to the control of transient excursions in coolant temperature are (1) the tendency of these temperature variations to be recirculated in the closed coolant loop, (2) the long transport lags associated with the coolant circulation, and (3) the large inherent time lags of thermometers measuring the coolant temperature."
"An electron analogue accelerator 45 feet in diameter is being constructed to test a variety of orbital properties of a strong-focusing synchrotron system. High-voltage sawtooth wave generators will supply the electrostatic bending and correcting lenses. A feed-back type radio frequency control and power amplifier supply a simple low-Q ferrite accelerating cavity. The rf control is designed to accommodate the phase stability transition encountered in strong-focusing synchrotrons. Auxiliary electronic systems will detect, observe, and time the circulating electron beam."
"In cooperation with the National Electronics Conference, the Professional Group on Nuclear Science (PGNS) of the Institute of Radio Engineers takes pleasure in presenting the advance program for its First National Annual Meeting."
"The problem of designing a constant reactor outlet temperature control system for a thermal reactor power plant is considered. The dynamic control characteristics of the power plant are described in terns of (1) the response of reactivity to variations of reactor inlet coolant temperature, (2) the heat transfer characteristics of the reactor and boiler, and (3) the time lags of the reactor coolant loop. It is shown how the inherent characteristics of the power plant may be used to advantage by constant reactor outlet temperature control systems employing the reactor inlet and outlet temperatures as control variables. An important feature of these control systems is the computation of the reactor inlet temperature from the boiler outlet temperature or the steam plant variables using recently developed transport delay circuits to compensate for the boilerto-reactor coolant transport delay."
"The past year has seen a major revitalization of the Professional Group on Nuclear Science. The Group has embarked on a long-range program vith sufficient momentum acquired so that the success of the Group seems assured. The Administrative Committee was enlarged from six members to nine members. The following committees were appointed and have been active in carrying out their assigned duties:"
"Section 1. This organization shall be known as the IRE Professional Group on Nuclear Science of the Institute of Radio Engineers, Incorporated."
"I. The Chairman of the Group shall appoint the following standing Committees:"
"Probably the most important functions of a Professional Group within the IRE are those of Keeping the membership informed of developments, both technical and non-technical, affecting the profession, and of providing an outlet for publication of papers too specialized for the general IRE audience. To fulfill these functions, it is recommended that the Professional Group on Nuclear Science discontinue the “Newsletter” and undertake the publication of “Transactions” on a quarterly basis, as outlined below."
"The abstracts in the following list were taken from “Nuclear Science Abstracts”, a publication of the Technical Information Service, U. S. Atomic Energy Commission. The number of each abstract is the serial number assigned by NSA. The abstracts are selected as being of probable use to those persons who are interested both in electronics and nuclear engineering. Abstracts of articles in such standard Journals as the Physical Review and the Review of Scientific Instruments are not included since articles from these journals are abstracted in the Proceedings of the I.R.E."

"The reflected (Gray) binary code has previously been used primarily in analog-to-digital conversion applications. However, the reflected binary code has, in addition, characteristics which strongly recommend it as a design factor in the synthesis of digital elements within closed-loop control systems. This paper describes several designs of typical reflected binary switching circuits. These switching circuits are, specifically, a reflected-to-conventional binary translator, reflected binary-to-analog converters, and a reflected binary contactor comparator. All of the circuit designs are logically related to the form of the reflected-to-conventional binary translator. These switching circuits can be used as digital control elements in the described original types of digital positional servomechanisms and digital accumulators."
"A pulse code modulator is described in which transistors are the only active circuit components. The functions of quantizing and encoding the signal are performed entirely by semiconductor diodes, using transistor amplifiers where necessary to increase the signal level. The readout is obtained from a set of “and” gates, each gate having as one of its inputs an output from the encoding system, and as the other input, a pulse obtained from a time delay circuit to assure sequential operation. The system produces a three digit binary code at a sampling rate of 5,000 cps."
"It is possible to read information nondestructively from two- and three-dimensional magnetic-core digital computer memories in several microseconds by exciting selected cores with rf currents. If two co-ordinate lines of a core in a memory array plane are driven at slightly different frequencies, a beat-frequency signal is generated whose phase may take on one of two values which are separated by 180 electrical degrees. These two possible phases correspond to the 0 and 1 information states of the core. The beat-frequency signal, separated from the inevitable noises by tuned linear filters, may be phase detected to yield the desired information."
"Time-delay networks suitable for an analog computer are designed by considering the location of poles and zeros in their transfer functions. The curve of phase shift against frequency should be a straight line. The negative slope of this curve is the time delay. Even-order derivatives of the curve automatically vanish at zero frequency. Roots of the transfer function are chosen to make vanish similarly as many as possible of the derivatives of odd order, higher than the first. Data are given for networks with one, two, three, and four pairs of roots."
"A new chopper-stabilized analog integrator circui, has been developed which, at the cost of two passive elementts enables the stabilizer amplifier to operate on the output drift due to input current as well as the drift due to unbalance."
"A description is given of an analog computer comparable in size to an automatic desk calculator. By combining the techniques of electronic and electric analogs, a high problem-solving capacity is achieved in a minimum of space. Nine stable high-gain dc amplifiers are provided, each of which can be made to produce a variety of functional responses. This is accomplished by allowing the operator to build up the input and feedback networks of each amplifier on a plug board, on which space is provided for additional networks involving resistors, capacitors, and crystal diodes. The plug board containing all the components and interconnections involved in a given problem can be stored in a filing cabinet when not in use. The low cost and small size of the computer make it suited for use in many situations in which an analog computer would not otherwise be used."
"The third Electronic Computer Session at the 1954 IRE National Convention was an experimental discussion on how to make computers more autonomous and how to make them self-repairing. The following pages are a transcript of that session, edited to make it more suitable for print. Each speaker's remarks have been edited by the speaker, which is why it has taken so long for this publication to appear. Some speakers merely corrected their grammar and some went considerably further, but the gist of the original discussion is still there."

"During the past year the membership of the PGEC has increased by over 1000, with the total paid membership now close to 2500. Active chapters have been established in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., New York, Chicago and Albuquerque. Chapters have been approved for Boston and Detroit, and efforts are being made to organize chapters in other sections of the country."
"This paper describes the logical nature of computing machines in terms of languages and the types of problems that can be solved by logical operations on languages. The problem of discovery in mathematics and empirical science is discussed, and an “inductive” machine is described which would be able to formulate hypotheses, modify them in the light of new experience and eventually discover the laws of a very simple universe."
"In the course of developing the system plans for the DYSEAC and the SEAC, certain standard methods and procedures were evolved for producing a large-scale digital computer design. These standard procedures cover, first, the development of system specifications, second, the development of functional plans, and finally the development of wiring plans. The later stages of these procedures are reducible to sequences of simple steps, capable of being systematically formulated in explicit terms. The similarity between these procedures and many of the data-processing procedures commonly being executed by present-day computers suggests that, with further development of these design techniques, the wiring plans for new computer systems might well be produced by existing digital machines."
"This paper discusses analog computation where the analog components consist of digital elements. Pulse rate is the quantity used to represent the data. Such computation systems may have many advantages over present analog techniques. The various components necessary to produce a complete computation system are described. Several examples of the use of these components to solve specific problems are shown."
"The correlation function, $\\phi_{ij}^{(\\tau)} = \\lim_{T \\rightarrow \\infty} {1 \\over T} \\int^{T}_{o} f_{i}(t)f_{j}(t-\\tau) dt$ is of great interest today because of its use in the fields of oceanography and meteorology and because of its recent applications in the field of communication. Various machines, both analog and digital, have been designed for the automatic computation of correlation functions. The machine described in this paper differs from those which have previously been described in the literature in that the speed with which it computes the integral above for each value of τi is mainly limited by the minimum value of T permissible for a precision of a few per cent."
"Wide-hand computing amplifiers capable of accurately and continuously yielding output signals with amplitudes proportional to the mathematical square of their input amplitudes have been developed. These computers are designed to be inserted in signal channels in much the same manner as conventional amplifiers, but impart thereto a square-law transfer characteristic. Details are given concerning a model that provides an accuracy of the order of 1 per cent of full scale over an output dynamic range of 40 db when operating on fractional microsecond, pulsed carrier signals."
"An investigation into the use of thyrite as an inexpensive nonlinear element in the electronic analog computer indicates that this material has great value as a device capable of delivering an output voltage proportional to the square of the input voltage. The factors discussed are the characteristics of the material and the means by which these may be modified to produce a device capable of squaring with an accuracy of 1.25% from dc to frequencies in excess of 1000 cps. This ability to square makes possible the more important operation of the multiplication of two variable voltages."
"Through the use of an electronic differential analyzer arranged to give a sixth-order approximation of the Laplace shift operator, it is possible to reproduce an input signal and delay it T seconds when the highest angular frequency present in the input signal does not exceed 12/T. Inaccuracy due to nonlinear phase shift is less than 2% under these conditions. This device requires only linear computing elements, and will permit delays of seconds within a finite frequency spectrum. An application to a closed loop industrial control problem is cited and other applications are suggested."
"HAROLD BELL, Jr. (S'52-A'54) was born in in Milwaukee, Wis., on March 30, 1927. After serving two years in the U.S. Navy, he attended the University of Wisconsin and received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering in 1950, 1951, and 1953 respectively."

"The DYSEAC is a complete general-purpose high-speed digital computer utilizing the same basic electronic circuit elements as those in SEAC. In the DYSEAC, however, these basic building blocks have been organized into a more powerful system for controlling and responding to auxiliary devices. Communication between these auxiliary devices and the DYSEAC (or between the DYSEAC and the persons operating it) can take place at any time, on a completely unscheduled basis, at the instigation of either the computer or the external world, or both acting jointly. The System features which enable such impromptu interchanges of information to occur are described in this paper."
"This article describes the design of a high speed electronic analog computing circuit which easily lends itself to time-sharing applications. By making use of a special high accuracy electronic switch and circuitry carefully designed to be independent of tube characteristics, it was possible to achieve a full-scale accuracy of better than 0.2 per cent over a wide range of input values. The unit described was built to carry out 400 complete multiplications and divisions in one second."
"The following article describes a device capable of finding the quotient of two numbers expressed in parallel binary code. Feedback type of operation is employed to form a closed loop wherein the desired quotient is the only possible steady state. The system response is similar to that of an RC circuit. The associated time constant is directly proportional to the pulse rate involved. This device has been successfully applied in control circuits where system variables are actual numbers rather than more common voltages or currents."
"It is the intention of this section to review articles that have been published since January 1, 1953 and to publish eventually reviews of all books of interest to those in the computer field. Articles dealing with electronic aspects of both analog and digital computers, as well as general expository articles, are to be included. All articles and books reviewed are numbered sequentially for each year; where known, the Universal Decimal Classification number is also given. The editors wish to express their gratitude to the reviewers who, through their efforts, make this section possible."

"Readers of the PGEC Transactions who regularly scan the not-so-fine print of the inside cover may have noticed the name of R. E. Meagher newly listed as the Editor in the June issue. Since the appointment was not settled until June 22nd, this was the fastest news coverage so far in the short history of the Transactions. The purpose of the last-minute change in the cover was to inform potential authors of the new editorial address. Unfortunately, we could not also make a more formal announcement in that short a time."
"A new type of high speed store is proposed for an electronic digital computer using interpretive program techniques. The store is based on the flying spot technique used in television signal generation. The information in the store may be read rapidly but is nonerasable. This store has the advantages of high storage density, good reliability and nonvolatility of information."
"A solution is sought to the general problem of simplifying switching circuits that have more than one output. The mathematical treatment of the problem applies only to circuits that may be represented by “polynomials” in Boolean algebra. It is shown that certain parts of the multiple output problem for such circuits may be reduced to a single output problem whose inputs are equal in number to the sum of the numbers of inputs and outputs in the original problem. A particularly simple reduction may be effected in the case of two outputs. Various techniques are described for simplifying Boolean expressions, called “+ polynomials,” in which the operation “exclusive or” appears between terms. The methods described are particularly suitable for use with an automatic computer, and have been tested on the Illiac. An unexpected metric relationship is shown to exist between the members of certain classes of “+ polynomials” called “nets.” This relationship may be used for constructing error-detecting codes, provided the number of bits in the code is a power of two."
"An algebraic theory of the logical operation of digital computers is developed. This theory takes into account the dynamic (time) behavior of computer processes. The computer signals and computer elements are described. Their properties which are pertinent to the logical operation of digital computers are abstracted and. formulated in mathematical terms. The signals are represented by algebraic symbols, and the way they are transformed by the elements of the computer is represented in terms of algebraic operations and functions. This computer algebra is based on Boolean algebra. Time is treated as a discrete variable and a method of taking into account the time relationships in the computer processes is developed. Specific components, such as gates, flip-flops, and magnetic drums, are analyzed, and an algebraic description of their operation is obtained."
"In magnetic recording of pulses, whether on drum or tape, the resulting flux pattern is affected by proximity of adjacent pulses. The best defined region is that adjacent to the maximum. In reading, the signal is the derivative of the flux. In the best defined region, this is close to a straight line passing through zero when the flux is a maximum. The slope of the curve at the zero changes sign with change of pulse polarity. A new method of reading is described which examines the signal from the head for such transitions from positive to negative or reverse as indications that a positive or negative pulse had been recorded. This is done by gating the inverted signal with the delayed signal for positive pulse reading and the inverse of this for reading negative pulses. Besides providing sharply defined outputs, this method permits reading both positive and negative pulses from a single channel without interference or ambiguity. Examples are given for using this facility for checking purposes and for storage of two types of data in a common channel."
"A two-channel voltage encoder having a sampling rate of 40 numbers/second in each channel has been designed for use in a data reduction system. The data are recorded on single-channel magnetic tape in the form of 10-digit binary numbers with an accuracy of ± 0.1 per cent. The range of input voltage is 0 to 1 volt and may be lowered to 0 to 10 mv through the use of chopper amplifiers. This lower range of input voltage covers the voltages generated by analog transducers commonly employed to measure temperatures, pressures, flow rates, and thrusts."
"As a result of a pressing need for function generators, a new method of function generation has been developed. The underlying principle of this function generator is the application of ordinary pulse techniques in such a way as to produce a function. The simplicity of design, the high accuracy attainable, the simple type of construction are the outstanding features of this general-purpose function generator. In order to compare this new type of function generator with those presently being used, three important types are discussed. These generators are of the general-purpose, electric and photoelectric types; other comparable electromechanical types are excluded.1"
"The solution of nonlinear engineering design problems demonstrates the need for a special function generator. The generator described in this paper satisfies this need. The basic components of the unit are discussed and the forms of functions which can be generated are shown. Accuracy is estimated by comparison of an oscillogram with the calculated curves. It is concluded from tests on the system that the function generator is a valuable aid in the handling of nonlinear design problems."
"NEW CHAPTERS Dallas-Fort Worth and Akron have been added to the growing list of chapters included in the last issue of the Transactions. There is now a total of 11 active chapters of the PGEC throughout the country. If there is no chapter in your area and there is sufficient interest in computers to warrant establishing one, please write to the editor of this column."

"The field of telemetering, contrary to some ideas, is much older than missile development Recognition was given this point when the decision was made to delete the restrictive word “radio” from the title of this group. The program of the 1953 National Telemetering Conference, which underscored all phases of the telemetering art, emphasized the broad aspects of this electronic field and the fact that we were a group of engineers working in a large community of broad interests."
"The trend among users and builders of automatic digital computing machines is to rely more and more on the computer itself to assist with the compilation of a computing routine. Experience has shown that use of the so-called interpretive subroutines often reduces the overall cost of acquiring a solution to a particular problem. It is also true that, disregarding problem solution time, interpretive subroutines could be written which would permit machines with the most elementary logic (i.e. an instruction list of plus, minus, compare, in, and out) to compare favorably with machines containing an elegant command list. However, though there has been an increased use in computers assembling their own routines, the complement of instructions built into such computers has also been increasing. This is typified by the advent of built-in floating point operations, base registers, etc. Unfortunately the trend of providing more special internal circuitry does not appear to have developed with respect to input-output, wherein negligible increase in machine flexibility other than through programming has been incorporated into newly released computers."
"A new FM subcarrier discriminator which utilizes a delay line as the frequency stable element has been developed at the Naval Research Laboratory. When the equipment is used as a telemetering discriminator under field conditions, linearities within 0.25% of full scale can be readily obtained. Theoretically, the linearity is perfect and linearities within 0.1% can be obtained under controlled conditions. No “screwdriver” or tuning adjustments are necessary with the exception of a zero balance in the output voltmeter circuit because the output has been made essentially independent of tube characteristics and component tolerances by the utilization of low power pulse techniques in conjunction with clamping and gating circuitry. The sensitivity is determined by the delay line in combination with a regulated reference voltage."
"A transistor oscillator which is stable up to 150°F has been developed for obtaining electrical measurements. A reactance-modulation technique uses time rather than gain to control the frequency shift. Reactive current of constant amplitude is applied to an L-C circuit for a controlled portion of each cycle. The portion of the cycle is controlled by a bias current injected into the modulating transistor. A differential converter circuit which functions also as a dc amplifier is used with the oscillator in making voltage measurements at high impedance level. Drift of the unit with variation in temperature, vibration, and supply voltage is comparable to that of vacuum-tube multivibrators and dc-amplifier combinations."
"There appears to be a strong reaction among some radio engineers that information theory, or if you prefer, communication theory, is an extremely obtuse and impractical subject useful only as an amusing pastime for mathematicians. Comments are heard much in the same vein as those once made in the aircraft industry about theoretical aerodynemics “It ain't practical, no good will come of it.”"
"Magnetic tape has many advantages for recording analog data such as those obtained in dynamic stress analysis, geophysical, and medical work. It is also useful as a storage medium for telemetered data, and as a “memory” for analog computers. The ability to recreate the original voltage lignai is perhaps its greatest virtue, in addition to which may be lie ted its durability, ease of storage, erasability, and immunity to ambient conditions."
"The structural simplicity of two-terminal compared to three-terminal devices indicates the potential importance of two terminal devices employing semiconductors and having negative resistance at frequencies properly related to the transit time of carriers through them. Such negative resistances may be combined with unsymmetrically transmitting components, such as gyrators or Hall effect plates, to form dissected amplifiers that may be made to simulate conventional three-terminal amplifiers and operate at high frequencies. The characteristics of several structures are analyzed on the basis of theory and it is found that negative resistances are possible for properly designed structures."
"This paper describes the use of junction diodes, reference voltage diodes, and junction transistors in regulated rectifiers for telephone power plants. It discusses the pertinent characteristics of these semiconductor devices, together with illustrative circuits in which they are used to control the flow of direct current power."
"The basic design of the wire spring relay departs from conventional relay design in many ways. Translation of some of these design departures into commercial relay manufacture has necessitated the development of new machines and new methods because those available were incapable of producing to the new design requirements. Two developments in this category involved the straightening of large quantities of small diameter wire and the molding of a multiplicity of straightened wire inserts into phenolic resin blocks. The manner in which these developments were reduced from problems to practice is the subject of this paper."
"The basic processes of percussive welding are presented. Large variations in arc duration result from the spread in initiation separation, magnetic bridging effects, and the amplifying effect of evaporation. Higher voltages are shown to decrease the relative spread of initiation separation. An analysis of bridging suggests minimizing the ratio of current to separation. A welding circuit offering independence from arc-duration variations is developed. The use of a capacitative transmission line, or approximations thereto, has resulted in greatly improved process control."
"Welding of precious metal contacts to the new wire spring relay has presented some unusual manufacturing problems. As the name implies, the springs of these relays are wires. The contacts through which electrical circuits are established consist of small blocks of palladium accurately and securely welded to one end of these wires. The wires, arranged in a parallel array, are imbedded for part of their length in molded phenol plastic to form parts which will be designated as “combs” in this paper. There are two kinds of combs, those with the wires arranged in pairs called twin wire combs, and single wire combs. Different welding techniques are required, each of which will be described separately."
"An electronic relay tester has been developed to gauge the contacts of a relay while it is pulsing. The device provides a visual presentation of the gauging position of up to 16 contacts at one time. The equipment has been developed primarily as a means for rapid inspection and concurrent adjustment (when needed) in relay manufacture. It may also be used as a laboratory instrument for studies of timing, chatter, and other performance characteristics of relays."
"Propagation through a gyromagnetic medium in a direction normal to a uniform magnetizing field is considered. Geometrical arrangements which make this propagation non-reciprocal are described. A few illustrative examples are discussed briefly. The non-reciprocal helix, of importance in traveling wave tube work, is treated at length."
"Part I of this paper dealt with various idealized transmission characteristics and with methods of evaluating pulse distortion resulting from various system imperfections. In Part II the resultant transmission impairments or limitations on pulse transmission rates are discussed for systems with low-pass, symmetrical band-pass and asymmetrical band-pass characteristics, and a comparison made of the transmission performance of double and vestigial sideband systems. The limitation on channel capacity imposed by random imperfections in the transmission-frequency characteristic, as compared to random noise, is also discussed."
"The circular electric wave in round metallic tubing has an attenuation coefficient which decreases as the frequency of operation is increased. A corollary to this behavior is the fact that any preselected attenuation coefficient can in theory be obtained in any predetermined diameter of pipe through the choice of a suitably high carrier frequency. The attenuation which is characteristic of microwave radio repeater links, about 2 db/mile, is in theory attainable in a copper pipe of about 2″ diameter using a carrier frequency near 50,000 mc. Scale-model transmission experiments, conducted at 9,000 mc, showed average transmission losses about 50 per cent above the theoretical value. These extra losses were due to (1) roughness of the copper surface and (2) transfer of power from the low-loss mode to other modes which can also propagate in the pipe. The latter effect may have serious consequences on signal fidelity because power will transfer (at successive waveguide imperfections) from the signal mode to unused modes and, after a time delay, back to the signal mode. This effect has been studied experimentally and theoretically, and it is concluded that (1) either mode filters must be inserted periodically to absorb the power in the unused modes of propagation, or (2) the medium itself must be modified to continuously provide large attenuations for the unused modes of propagation. The latter approach is attractive in that it also provides a solution to the problem of bending this form of low-loss guide."
"This is a report on the development of a new type of governor for regulating the speed of rotary dials. The paper includes derivation of the equations of motion which determine the theoretical speed of the governor during dial run-down and an analysis of the operating characteristics of the governor as influenced by varying friction and input torque. Experimental verification of the relations is presented. A theoretical analysis which explains “governor chatter” or positional instability for friction-centrifugal governors is also given."
"Single-frequency signaling liberates dial systems from the restrictions of dc signaling methods. This freedom, as might be expected, is most important in the long distance telephone plant where trunks are frequently too long or have no conductors for dc signaling. The general plan of signal frequency (SF) signaling is based upon continuous signaling because of it's speed and reliability. In this respect it is like the usual dc trunk signaling schemes. SF uses steady current in the trunk signaling path for the normal idle trunk condition and no current in the signaling path for the other and alternate busy (talking) trunk condition. This choice of signal conditions is essential for SF signaling in-band systems, which as the name implies operate within the standard voice channel, to avoid conflict between signal and voice transmission. The same conditions are also used in SF out-of-band and separate line systems. The in-band SF system can be used with any type or length of line facility that meets normal voice transmission requirements and is therefore the preferred method used by the Bell System to meet requirements for toll dialing on a national basis, with other signaling arrangements limited to the shorter trunks. The requirements, design considerations, main features, and method of operation for the in-band system are outlined in this paper."
"A centralized automatic message accounting system (CAMA) has been developed so that the billing data can be recorded at a centralized crossbar tandum office for message unit and toll calls originated by telephone customers served by a large number of local dial central offices. It is an essential part of facilities for economical nationwide customer dialing through central offices with older types of switching equipment and through other central offices which could not otherwise economically give this service. The new system records the billing data on paper tapes in the same form now used by local automatic message accounting systems. Tapes for both local and centralized automatic message accounting systems are processed in the same accounting center."
"Many microwave tubes make use of a long electron beam. The radio frequency excitation on such a beam can be expressed in terms of two space-charge waves, one of which has negative energy and negative power flow. The electron beam may pass through resonators, through lossy surroundings, through slow-wave circuits. In this paper the low-level operation of klystrons, resistive-wall amplifiers, easitrons, space-charge-wave amplifiers, traveling-wave tubes and double-stream amplifiers is explained in terms of waves on electron beams and on circuits. Noise is discussed in terms of such waves."
"The first part is a presentation of an analytical study of the open-contact performance of twin contacts. It provides means for predicting their performance from single contact data. It is shown that the probability of failure of twin contacts is generally appreciably greater than the square of the probability of failure of single contacts. This is supplemented with the results of an experimental study which determines the effects of a few design parameters on the performance of single contacts. These are the parameters that determine the magnitude of improvement in performance obtained by replacing single contacts by twin contacts."
"In 1945 the Bell System embarked on an extensive study with the purpose of developing a program for operator toll dialing on a nationwide basis. Operator toll dialing had been done, of course, on a limited scale in various parts of the country for many years, but the concept of this program was one of nationwide proportions carried on with a uniform numbering plan∗ arrangement and a completely integrated trunking system which would handle traffic at a high speed between any two points in the United States and Canada, even in the busier hours of the day. Implementation of this program required the development of new switching mechanisms and the exploitation of carrier transmission potentialities to a degree never before achieved. Great strides had already been made in these fields, resulting in the practical development of the coaxial cable system and the first toll crossbar switching office installed at Philadelphia in 1943. But the very core of the nationwide dialing plan was the proposal to revolutionize the method of traffic distribution so as to combine high speed handling over the intertoll trunk network with a highly efficient use of facilities. The method of accomplishing is called “engineered alternate routing”"
"This article describes the Intertoll trunk concentrating equipment which is a special purpose common-control type switching system. Its function is to combine, at a central point, small groups of trunks serving traffic originating at various outward toll switchboards and to route the combined traffic to a toll or tandem crossbar office in a distant toll center. The operators at the outward toll switchboards are thereby provided with the equivalent of direct access to the intertoll trunk circuits. Both operating and equipment savings are realized by the use of this concentrating equipment as compared to handling the same traffic via a toll crossbar office at the originating toll center."
"The development of the transistor has provided an active element having important advantages in space and power. As a result, the question arises whether strategic insertion of such active elements in passive networks might lead to interesting results. This paper gives a theoretical analysis confirmed by experiment, of certain possible network applications of transistors. Four general areas are considered in which transistors are used as follows: to reduce the detrimental effects of dissipative reactive elements, to eliminate the necessity for inductors in frequency selective circuits, to produce two terminal envelope delay structures having zero loss, and to invert the impedance of reactive structures. The conclusion is drawn that judicious interspersion of transistors in a transmission network enables performance to be achieved which would otherwise be unobtainable or uneconomical."
"A method has been recently developed for measuring thickness variations of a non-conductive cable sheathing, extruded over a grounded metal jacket. The method translates direct capacitance increments, sensed by probes sliding on the surface of the sheath, into thickness increments. The accuracy of the system based on this method is sufficiently high that the electrical error, which is of the order of a few thousandths of a μμF, can be disregarded. Experimental data indicate that accuracy of the new system for absolute thickness measurements of homogeneous samples in stationary conditions is of the order of 0.002‖. The error caused by translating capacitance to thickness depends on manufacturing elements and process tolerances, and can be evaluated on a statistical basis. Thus incremental measurements of the cable sheath thickness on the production line yield accuracies of the order of 0.003‖. Application of this method to absolute sheath thickness measurements involves assumptions directly related to calibration and manufacturing process control. These aspects are rather extraneous to a measuring system per se, and, therefore, are not within the scope of this paper."
"In the course of development of the card translator for use in the No. 4A toll crossbar system it was necessary to evaluate in detail the performance characteristics of all phases of the translator operation. One of the most important phases was that of the action of the translator cards. Since the action of these cards is controlled by the simultaneous influence of many independent variables a study of the card action was made using statistically designed experiments. This study made use of Graeco-Latin Square and Factorial Designs; herewith is presented a detailed description of their application to the problem. Also the method of analysis of the data and resulting conclusions are described in detail."
"This paper analyses the nature of wave propagation along a cylindrical electron beam, focused in Brillouin flow by means of a finite axial magnetic field. Two different types of conducting boundaries external to the beam are treated: (1) the concentric cylindrical tube, forming a drift region; and (2) the sheath helix, forming a model of the helix traveling-wave tube. The field solution of the helix problem is used to evaluate the normal-mode parameters of an equivalent circuit seen by a thin beam, thereby permitting computation of the gain constant of growing waves. The gain constant of the cylindrical beam with Brillouin flow is found to exceed that of a similar beam with rectilinear flow, presumably because of the transverse component of electron motion in the former"
"Expressions are given for the diffraction field far behind, and the surface currents on, a parabolic cylinder. Approximate values for the field strength and current density are given when the radius of curvature of the cylinder is large compared to a wavelength. The formulas may have value in predicting the shadows that are cast by hills in microwave propagation. The idea of representing hills by knife-edges has been used successfully by a number of investigators. The theory of the parabolic cylinder indicates that such a representation is valid even for gently rounded hills when the angle of diffraction is small. On the other hand, when the angle of diffraction is so large that the knife-edge calculations do not apply, the results presented here may be used."
"The electromechanical relay is the basic building block of modern dial switching systems and also of various automatic control systems and computers."
"The dynamic equations applying to the operation and release of electromagnets are derived in a form in which the armature position and the flux linkages of the coil are the variables to be determined as functions of time. The effective magnetomotive force and pull are taken as given by the static magnetization relations. This formulation is valid if the dynamic field pattern is substantially that of the static field, and it is shown that this condition is satisfied if the effective conductance of the eddy current paths is small compared with that of the coil or other linking circuits. This is usually the case in operation, but is not the case in normal release. Approximate solutions are obtained for both fast and slow operation, giving the time as related to the mechanical work done, the mass and travel of the moving parts, and the steady state power input to the coil. Expressions are derived for optimum coil design and pole face area, and design requirements for fast operation are discussed. An approximate expression is derived for the release waiting time, the initial period of field decay prior to armature motion. The effect on this decay of contact protection in the coil circuit is discussed. The slow release case is treated in another article in this issue. An analysis is given of the armature motion in release, and the results of an analog computer solution to this problem reported. These show the effect of design parameters, particularly the armature mass, on the velocity attained in release motion, and hence on the amplitude of armature rebound."
"For each relay structure, there exists a best winding, once the circuit power has been specified. The best winding is that one which operates the relay in the least time. Methods for determining the best winding are developed. On the basis of the operating time, the relay behavior is classed as mass or load controlled. The design method chosen depends upon this classification. The design of windings for series connected relays is based on a method of determining equivalent single relays, the behavior of each corresponding to one of the series relays. This method is generalized to allow for different magnetic structures for the several relays. Each relay winding is then designed in turn, using the design data for its own type of structure. The best winding design is not given directly by an explicit formula. Rather, methods are developed for determining the operate time for any winding. Then by choosing a range of windings, the best one is selected by interpolation."
"This article presents an analytical treatment of the relations controlling the release time of slow release relays, in which field decay is delayed by the currents induced in a conducting sleeve or slug. An hyperbolic relation between flux and magnetomotive force, fitting the decreasing magnetization curve, is used for the relation between induced voltage and current in the sleeve circuit in determining the rate of field decay. Methods are given for estimating and measuring the magnetization constants and those appearing in the relation between pull and field flux. These relations are used as a basis for a discussion of the design of slow release relays and of the adjustment procedures employed to meet timing requirements."
"Today's telephone central office is largely built around the telephone relay. As each office may use some 60,000 of them, their performance characteristics, as well as their first cost, have a very important influence on the cost of the office. By properly balancing such factors economically, the lowest cost office can be planned. This paper shows how performance features and design factors may all be expressed as “equivalent first cost,” and so be related to manufacturing cost itself. The influence of lot-size on manufacturing cost is considered including a determination of optimum lot-sizes, to aid the relay designer in deciding on standardized models. With a basic performance language formulated — equivalent first cost — optimum relations among the variables may be established. Such results are given for (a) optimum coil-plus-power costs, (b) optimum power-plus-speed costs, (c) optimum number of relay codes, and other related problems. Methods are also given to evaluate how serious the effect may be when optimum conditions are not satisfied. Were it not for the application of these methods, central office costs would be much higher."
"The mechanical work and the speed of operation of telephone relays are determined in a large measure by the characteristics of the relay magnet. The underlying magnetic principles and the resulting design relationships for magnets are discussed in this article, which is in part a review of the background material and in part a description of its use in developing methods for magnet design and the analysis of magnet performance. Basic energy considerations are shown to determine the relations between the work capacity and the magnetization characteristics, and analytical expressions for the latter are given in terms of the dimensions and materials of the magnet. These expressions are developed for the magnetic circuit approximation to static field theory, which is shown to provide an adequate representation of the field relations controlling performance. Methods are given for representing the magnetic circuit relations by means of a simple equivalent circuit. Expressions are derived for the mechanical output of the relay in parameters of this simple equivalent circuit, and these expressions used to determine optimum conditions for meeting specific design objectives."
"It is shown in this article that the observed magnetization relations of most ordinary electromagnets conform to simple expressions which can be interpreted as the flux vs. magnetomotive force equations of a reluctance network, analogous to the current-voltage equations of a resistance network. To the extent of such conformity the magnetic circuit constants characterizing the network suffice for the evaluation of the field energy and pull characteristics of the electromagnet. The agreement between the observed magnetization and these simple relations is close in the region of linear magnetization, and is adequate for engineering purposes at higher flux densities, but the extent of agreement in the latter range varies with the type of structure and the location of the magnetic parts which first approach saturation. Specific analytical and graphical procedures are given for the evaluation of the magnetic circuit constants from both pull and magnetization measurements. These procedures employ relations which give linear plots indicating the degree of conformity of the observed relations to the expressions used to fit them. The relation of the measured constants to those which can be estimated in design1 is discussed, as is the use and application of the measured constants in development and engineering studies."
"Theory indicates that the useful frequency range of junction transistor riodes may be extended by a factor of ten by a new structure, the p-n-i-p, which uses a thick collector depletion layer of intrinsic (i-type) semiconductor to reduce greatly the collector capacitance and to increase the collector breakdown voltage. This structure will permit simultaneous achievement of high alpha cutoff frequency, low ohmic base resistance, low collector capacitance, and high collector breakdown voltage. Because of the high breakdown voltages and larger areas per unit capacitance, permissible power dissipations appear much larger than for other high frequency junction types. Theoretical calculations indicate that oscillations at frequencies as high as 3,000 mcps may be possible. Early exploratory models have verified the basic theory. Progress toward initial design objectives has been encouraging. In general, the observed performance has been consistent with the materials used and the structure achieved. The highest frequency of oscillation obtained to date is 95 mcps. Better performance is expected as technical control of materials and structures is improved."
"This is a presentation of a study of the discharge phenomena occurring between contacts on break of an inductive load. The main objectives are: (1) to forward some detailed explanations of the main components of a break transient in terms of basic conduction and emission processes, and (2) to establish the conditions that determine the nature of the transients. The study covered the following: (1) occurrence of interrupted and steady arcs, (2) initiation of reversed arcs in one breakdown, (3) arc initiation under dynamic conditions, (4) initiation and maintenance of glow discharge, and (5) glow-arc transitions."
"The manufacture of multiple sheath for Alpeth and Stalpeth cables requires the application of a sheath of polyethylene over a sheath of corrugated metal which is flooded with a rubber asphaltic compound. For high quality and minimum cost, this outer sheath must be of uniform thickness throughout its length. One of the problems in cable sheath manufacture is to maintain the concentricity and average thickness of the extruded polyethylene sheath to close limits during manufacture. This article reports on: (1) The application of a capacitance sensitive bridge to the measurement of the eccentricity and average thickness of the sheath on cables moving at speeds of 20 to 100 feet per minute; (2) The method of thickness calibration; and (3) The use of the thickness measurements in maintaining the sheath concentricity and average thickness within close limits during the sheathing operation."
"The characteristic equation for the propagation constants of waves in a filled circular guide of arbitrary radius is written in terms of magnetizing field and a carrier density, which are shown essentially to determine the dielectric and permeability tensors for a gas discharge plasma and for a fertile. The complex structure of the spectrum of propagation constants and its dependence upon radius and the two parameters are analyzed by a semigraphical method, supplemented by exact formulae in special regions. Thus the course of individual modes may be charted with fair accuracy."
"Some theory describing the behavior of two coupled waves is presented, and it is shown that this theory applies to coupled transmission lines. A loose-coupling theory, applicable when very little power is transferred between the coupled waves, shows how to taper the coupling distribution to minimize the length of the coupling region. A tight-coupling theory, applicable when the coupling is uniform along the direction of wave propagation, shows that a periodic exchange of energy between coupled waves takes place provided that the attenuation and phase constants (α1 and β respectively) are both equal, or provided that the phase constants are equal and the difference between the attenuation constants (α1 — α2) is small compared to the coefficient of coupling c. Either (α1 — α2)/c or (β1 — β2)/c being large compared to unity is sufficient to prevent appreciable energy exchange between the coupled waves. Experimental work has confirmed the theory. Applications include highly efficient pure-mode transducers in multi-mode systems, and frequency-selective filters."
"A compendium is presented of theoretical fundamentals relating to pulse transmission, for engineering applications. Emphasis is given to the consideration of various imperfections in transmission systems and resultant transmission impairments or limitations on transmission capacity. In Part I of this paper, Sections 1 to 11, fundamental properties of transmission-frequency characteristics are discussed, together with general relations between frequency and pulse transmission characteristics and special transmission characteristics of importance in pulse systems. This is followed by a presentation of engineering methods of evaluating pulse distortion from various types of gain and phase deviations. In Part II, Sections 12–16, transmission limitations imposed by characteristic distortion will be discussed."
"Samples have been cut from single crystals of the nickel-iron ferrite (NiO)0.75 (FeO0.25Fe2O3 in such a way that they contain one and only one movable ferromagnetic domain wall. The viscous damping coefficient for this wall, which is a measure of the losses associated with domain wall motion in this material, has been measured as a function of temperature. This damping shows a very large increase as the temperature goes down to the region of 77°K. The value of this damping is correlated with the Landau-Lifshitz equation for the rotational motion of magnetization by means of previously available theoretical analysis. In addition, it is suggested that the sharp increase in damping at low temperatures is due to a relaxation associated with a rearrangement of the valence electrons on the divalent and trivalent iron ions in the ferrite. A tentative phenomenological theory of the losses based on this mechanism is presented."
"In the exchange telephone plant, speech is transmitted largely at voice frequencies over a single pair of wires that carries conversation in both directions. Until recently, adequate transmission was assured through a suitable choice of coil loading and conductor size. The need for voice frequency amplifiers had long been recognized, but wide use of the conventional hybrid type of repeater with separate amplifiers for conversation in the two directions had not been economic. In 1948, however, a new type of repeater was introduced that used the same source of gain for transmission in both directions, and did not require costly filters. This repeater is known as the E1 repeater. It operates as a negative impedance in the line. This paper describes the wide field of usefulness of two new types of negative impedance repeaters, the E2 and E3. Sufficient theory is given to show the advantages of using two types of negative impedance in a line, the series type and the shunt type, and how, by the addition of the shunt type to the series type, it is possible to insert gain without serious reactions on line impedance. The new equipment is described and maintenance features, together with methods of testing this relatively new type of repeater, are discussed."
"The solderless wrapped connection is initially held together by the hoop stress in the wire which enters the connection as a result of the tension put on the wire by the wrapping tool. Measurements made out to a time of 1.5 years at room temperature show that the tension has decreased to 70 per cent of the one day value (8000 lbs per square inch) in this period. Two methods of extrapolation are discussed, both of which indicate that at least half of the initial one day value will remain at the end of forty years at room temperature. Another set of stresses enters the connection as a function of time, namely the diffusion forces produced by diffusion of the tin plating into the brass terminal and copper wire. A number of experiments are discussed which show that the activation energy of diffusion is materially reduced by the shearing stresses in the connection. Measurements at two temperatures, which allow extrapolation to room temperature, indicate that at the end of two years the force required to strip the wire from the terminal has increased by 5 per cent over the initial value and that at the end of forty years the increase will be 20 per cent. Support for these conclusions is furnished by tests on actual connections that have been in the field for one year and ten months, which show an increase of 5 per cent in the stripping force even though the relaxed hoop stress is only 68 per cent of the initial value. The increase, which is due to diffusion forces, can be made higher by using zinc, cadmium or aluminum plating, and the fusion occurs in a shorter time."
"The trend in new telephone switching systems toward faster operation, longer life and lower cost, indicates a need for faster and more capable control circuits. This paper describes a new high speed wire spring multicontact relay designed primarily for these applications. The basic unit contains 30 make-contact pairs. Two variations of the new design provide relays of 60-contact capacity. They are mechanically and electrically interchangeable with all crossbar system multicontact relays."
"Some problems, complete discussion of which would be extremely difficult, are treated approximately by means of perturbation theory. Among these are the partially filled cylindrical waveguide, and the problem of multiple internal reflections in a sample of finite length filling the cross section of a cylindrical guide. Propagation in a ferrite between parallel planes, magnetized along the propagation direction is discussed by the methods described in Part I. The paper concludes with an addendum to Part I — a numerical study of field patterns of the TE11-limit and TM11-limit mode for various dc magnetic fields."
"This device permits the production of direct-positive variable-area recordings of higher densities and lower cross-modulation distortion than hitherto possible. This is accomplished by pre-distorting the recorded signal electrically so as to cancel the cross-modulation components produced by image spread due to the use of high track densities."
"This paper describes a two-way loudspeaker system having an extended frequency range and exceptionally uniform distribution. These characteristics, which effectively meet the requirements for the presentation of stereophonic sound in motion-picture theaters, are obtained by the use of an acoustic lens. Spherical and elliptical lens elements accommodate the distribution pattern to variously shaped auditoria. Design features of the low-frequency horn provide a clean response which is essentially free from resonance."
"A time-saving device to plot movement over stationary artwork on the animation stand, assuring smooth movement in acceleration and deceleration, is described. The necessity of working out mathematical coordinates is eliminated. Extremely complicated movements of the stand can be plotted in a short time."
"In storage-type television film pickup systems, usual either the light source is pulsed or else a mechanical shutter is used on the projector. This paper describes a third method, wherein the film is projected continuously, even during pulldown, on the photocathode of an image-orthicon tube. The image section of the tube, however, is keyed electronically so that it operates only during vertical blanking. Simple apparatus for the use with studio cameras is described."
"Set-lighting in making motion pictures for color television is described. It was found that optimum television picture quality was obtained when the subject-lighting contrast was reduced to correspond more nearly with the range of brightness which can be reproduced over a color-television system."
"In 1946 the Navy. Bureau of Ships realized that a new light source would have to be found and adapted to the Joint Army-Navy type 16mm projectors, then under the initial phases of development, if the shipboard and overseas 35 mm replacement program was to be completely acceptable to all equipment users. The xenon lamp appears to provide the desired answer."
"Xenon compact arc lamps have been developed which have high brightnesses, spectral-energy distributions in the visible spectrum resembling closely that of sunlight, and color temperatures of 5200 to 6000 K. A 1000-w lamp for a-c operation is described and its characteristics enumerated. When these lamps are operated on suitable a-c electrical circuits, they may be used very satisfactorily in portable equipment for projection of 16mm film by Cinema Scope and 3-D optical systems."
"This paper describer the problems involved, and their solution, in the incorporation of the xenon-are lamp into the Armed Forces AQ-2(1) 16mm Sound Motion-Picture Projector. Shutterless synchronized pulsed-light operation and the ballast design are explained."
"The increased use of xenon-filled flashtubes for commercial, illustrative, scientific and industrial fields is reported along with an analysis of the advantages obtained. Factor that should be considered in applying electronic flash are defined along with a report on efforts to obtain uniformity in the definition of terms. New applications of standard single-flash and repetitive-flash equipment in photo-instrumentation, photocopy and industrial research work are described."
"1953 will be remembered as a year of revolutionary change and progress in motion pictures and television. The advent of Cinerama and 3-D in the latter part of 1952 stirred the motion-picture industry into intense activity. The showings of Cinerama continued throughout the year and more theaters were added for its exhibition. 3-D pictures enjoyed considerable popularity for a time and thousands of theaters were equipped for showing them. With the improved methods now under development, 3-D may well establish itself in the future as a stable part of the entertainment industry. Stereophonic sound and sound placement spread from the Cinerama to 3-D and other showings. Theaters by the thousands took on the “New Look” by installing larger screens. Hundreds of Cinema-Scope installations were completed here and many abroad, introducing much wider screens, a new screen shape, anamorphic lens and single-film, 4- track stereophonic sound. Drive-in theaters increased in popularity and number, and the size of their new screens has been markedly increased due to higher reflective screen, materials. The introduction of larger screens necessitated more lighting which led to improved lamphouses, carbons, lenses and screen materials with a higher light gain."
"In the projection of motion-picture film at high intensities for maximum screen illumination, it is sometimes desirable to cool the film and control its position with a blast of high velocity air. This paper presents a method for evaluating the design, placement, and operation of the jet which provides the cooling air. The heart of the method is the fact that the brightness of certain phosphors depends strongly on temperature. Such phosphors provide an immediate visual indication of the temperature distribution over the film face. Examples of several air flow patterns revealed by the use of phosphors are discussed. Test results obtained by projection of film are compared with predictions."
"In stereoradiography, image displacement is obtained either by shifting the x-ray tube, or, less often, by keeping the tube stationary and rotating the subject through a few degrees of angle between exposures. Either of the methods can be applied to stereo cinefluorography, but the rotational method has the advantage of not requiring special x-ray equipment. A single-film projector having two picture apertures for stereo projection of rotational films is described."
"An experimental model of a 16mm projector is described in which air pressure is used to effect pulldown of the film. Some results of speed tests for this type of pulldown are discussed."
"Historically, the use of artificial light in the motion-picture industry has followed a number of recurring cycles. The use of various types of lighting equipment has not always been a matter of evolution. On several occasions there has been a revolution in which carbon arcs were moved down from the top place by incandescent tungsten lamps and vice versa. The influences behind these cyclic changes were the advent of panchromatic film, the arrival of sound, the application of three-color photography, and finally an economic factor which resulted in a major change in the spectral sensitivity of all color films. During these various cycles, illuminants such as mercury tubes, fluorescent tubes and even mercury combined with other gases were experimented with, or used to some extent, but the main artificial light sources were carbon-arc lamps and incandescent tungsten lamps, used separately or in combination, and with one source or the other usually in a dominant position."
"Beginning with the regular roll film emulsion-coated on a length of clear support, which was sent to Mr. Edison for his first experiments, there have been many changes and improvements in the negative motion-picture films and the addition of positive films, sound-recording films and other special films which have themselves been improved from time to time, resulting in improved techniques and better motion pictures."
"This paper presents a nontechnical exposition of the color film situation between 1930 and 1954. The relation of color to professional feature entertainment motion pictures and the part that color cinematography plays in the construction and reproduction of such pictures are described."
"A duo-flash equipment provides accurately timed, short-duration light flashes for double-exposure, time-motion studies. The present circuitry is intended for use in observing action occurring in the range of 0.3 to 300 msec."
"The problems involved in obtaining optimum tone and color reproduction in 35mm motion-picture color prints are discussed. A color negative material is used for exposure in the camera and three separation positives are printed from it; then a duplicate color negative is made on an internegative material from the separation positives. The influence of the sensitometric characteristics of the individual films of this system requires the careful use of sensitometric analyses at each stage to determine the optimum printing and processing conditions. A procedure is described which has been found helpful in determining these conditions."
"A simple microdensitometer is described. It is a scanning unit which may be used in conjunction with a normal microscope. An enlarged real image of a film sample is moved across a stationary slit. The image motion is provided by a rotating block of glass. An electrical signal (from a phototube behind the slit) is converted to a density signal and is presented on a cathode-ray oscilloscope Some uses of microdensitometric traces are suggested."
"The Signal Corps is charged with exploring the areas of application of television in military operations. As a part of this program, the Signal Corps has been conducting a series of studies in the fields of tactical and training uses of television."
"This paper describes the beginnings of television, both in the U.S.A. and abroad. Once there had been formulated the desire to transmit pictorial intelligence, including motion, from one point to another, many ingenious attempts to solve the technical problems were proposed. The paper describes a number of the more significant early steps and points out that although they were broadly successful in obtaining the primary objective of “seeing at a distance,” they were limited as to the amount of pictorial matter that could be transmitted."
"This paper first describes the gradual transition from mechanical television to the present all-electronic television. It gives a brief account of the major developments leading to the present types of pickup and reproducing equipment, and describes the growth of network facilities which has made possible the present wide distribution of television programming in the United States."
"Silver deposits provide the simplest means of obtaining satisfactory sound reproduction from color films when the phototube has the standard Sl response. Some factors are discussed affecting the dimensional characteristics of redevelopers applied by roller or extrusion methods. The formula of a new soundtrack developer for the Eastman Color Print Films is given. The method of selecting coating aids may be useful for determining satisfactory materials for other processes requiring dimensional stability of applied solutions."
"A soundtrack developer applicator of the roller type is described. It gives soundtracks of high quality and operates from the lowest practical processing-machine film speeds to over 340 fpm. Design features are discussed. Important to success of the applicator is a highly efficient squeegee which is described in detail."
"A Pfaff “zig-zag” type sewing machine has been used in the development of an automatic stitch splicer for splicing 35mm film before processing. The complete splicing operation can be done quickly and easily in the dark with a minimum of operator training. The splice, made with nylon thread, has several features not found in tape, staple and heat splices. Most important are strength with flexibility, no effect from solutions or softening of film, and no damage to equipment used on the processing machine."
"To obtain maximum information from rapid serial studies of living subjects, the films should be viewed both in slow motion and as stills. Thii requires special projection apparatus. Alterations carried out on a Kodak “Analyst” projector make possible tolerably flicker-free projection at speeds between 15 and 6 frames/sec and also pushbutton controlled single-frame operation, either forward or reverse. Change-over from continuous to single-frame operation can be made quickly, without manual adjustment of focus or illumination."
"A satisfactorily bright and steady image of large size can be obtained from the projection of a 16mm print if good film, a good camera, a good printer and a good projector are used. — It has been shown by a trade survey that 16mm prints differ appreciably in steadiness. This was learned by viewing prints made in various laboratories from a 16mm reversal original, or from a 35mm negative made from the same scene. The steadiness of some prints approached the quality of the 16mm original, as was found by the examination of the prints made especially for this survey. It was also noticed that the photographic quality of the prints varied over a wide range, comparable to the observed variation in steadiness."
"Most of the distortions perceived in stereoscopic pictures are caused by false perspective. False perspective cannot be corrected by variation of the camera interaxial separation. Parallax movements, which result from head movements in ordinary experience, are lacking in stereoscopic pictures, and are replaced by perverse twists of the scene. This lack is felt as a real shortcoming of stereoscopic motion pictures, and is best masked by frequent movement of the camera during shots."
"The methods of converting the 24 frames/sec film standard to the 30 frames/sec television standard are discussed. The disadvantage of using storage-type devices is brought out in order to show the need for a flying-spot scanner in televising film in color. The reasons for choosing the jump-scan method in the Motorola scanner are given with emphasis on the advantage of the large optical aperture realized with this method. This is possible since no moving optical parts are needed between the tube and the film and the full opening of the lens can be used. — The various factors affecting registry both in time and space are enumerated. The solutions used to minimize the errors and the final results obtained are given. The use of a signal derived from the leading edges of the sprocket perforations to control the position of scan on the tube face to minimize bounce is described in detail. The use of this signal for continuous correction of film shrinkage is also shown. Other features of the scanner to be described are the anastigmatic deflection yoke and single-control adjustable gamma."
"It is anticipated that theater television will require networks of intercity and local video distribution channels similar to those now furnished for television broadcasting. To meet needs of broadcasters and occasional theater requirements, the network circuits are being rapidly extended. Currently about 40,000 miles of video circuits are in use for television network facilities. Both radio relay and coaxial systems are used in these networks. Many special designs and operating features are required to insure good transmission over the long distances involved in nationwide network service."
"The aim of special photographic effects is to produce a duplicate negative which contains an image as a result of one or more exposures. The various methods for making the exposure or exposures are described in terms of equipment and the diagrammatic evolution of that equipment. This paper attempts to coordinate the many specialized phases of trick photography toward a common ground. There is first contact duplication without a lens; a lens is added allowing selective duplication and consequently matte shots. By removing the films from contact position and placing a lens between them, an optical printer is represented. Lastly, another lens and a translucent screen are added to the system displaying the projection background process."
"Dubbing, meaning postsynchronization, presents three problems: technicoartistic, technical and artistic. Several solutions are proposed and one universally accepted in Italy is illustrated. A good dubbing recording should match as closely as possible the sound quality expected in connection with the photographic image — resulting studio requirements are listed. Some features characteristic of the Italian language regarding structure of the audio signal, e.g. its average power distribution within the audiofrequency band, are listed and technical provisions to meet resulting requirements are analyzed. Some of the editing techniques adopted in Italy are described."
"The control of continuous processes requires four distinct operations: (1) establishment and specification of the desired levels, (2) continuous evaluation to determine whether specifications are being met, (3) diagnosis when they are not met, and (4) taking corrective action. How each of these four operations are conducted in the Eastman Kodak Co. in controlling the Kodachrome processes is discussed, and it is indicated that these procedures may have application in the control of these or other processes elsewhere. Precautions to be observed and some of the principal causes of poor control are also indicated."
"The skilled professional is well acquainted with the staging, lighting, camera, film and sound recording techniques that result in successful color motion pictures for direct screen projection; however, relatively few have had the opportunity to study in detail the reproduction of film over a color-television system. Accordingly, this paper has been prepared as a tentative guide to the factors that should be taken into consideration when shooting motion-picture film for color-television applications."
"A study is made of five criteria that are being used with photoelectric instruments to determine camera exposure. The only really satisfactory method appears to be the use of maximum and minimum brightnesses for the portion of the scene range over which the photographer desires gradation. The exposure time is then found by relating these two points to the characteristic curve of the film. The poorest method seems to be the popular one of determining exposure by the average scene brightness as measured with a photoelectric exposure meter."
"A number of researches have been made to determine the photometric range of outdoor scenes. The results are considered of importance in the determination of photographic exposure and as criteria for the improvement of artificial lighting. The data obtained by different investigators differ so widely, however, that one becomes suspicious. An examination indicates that the concept of overall range is meaningless and should be abandoned."
"This is a survey of the photographic methods and apparatus used to obtain detailed pictures of missiles in flight and of shockwaves and other phenomena of the medium through which such missiles pass, and to determine space-time coordinates of ballistic events. Special emphasis is placed on apparatus developed and used at the U.S. Naval Proving Ground."
"Color-television program production requires more stringent studio practices than does monochrome television. Camera and system adjustments must be made more precisely, the maximum scenery reflectance level must be reduced, the color balance of the studio illumination must be controlled, a higher light level must be provided and effects light ratios must be reduced. Careful attention to these aspects, in accordance with procedures outlined in this paper, together with an understanding of the fundamental difference between color and luminance contrast, makes possible satisfactory simultaneous reproduction in both color and monochrome."
"A review of the characteristics and operating features of various light sources for color television is presented. The factors leading to the present choice of tungsten illumination are discussed both on a theoretical and practical basis. Some operating experiences are described and the overall effects demonstrated."
"The major difficulties of subject lighting under water, selective absorption and selective scattering, are overcome by using an equipment with an artificial light source set at the shortest possible distance from the subject. This paper describes such an equipment and discusses the engineering considerations of pressure and corrosion resistance, balancing, hydrostatics, streamlining, etc., that influenced its design. It considers optical problems in connection with absorption and scattering between subject and camera, and special underwater complementary lenses. Both daylight picture taking and artificial lighting are dealt with. The torpedo, its principle, light source, power supply, controls, propulsion and engineering are shown. Experiences and results described are based on 120 dives under water."
"New color films of the negative-positive type have hastened the general trend from black-and-white to color in the motion-picture industry. In order to overcome low emulsion speed of these stocks which limits their use under certain location conditions, an attempt has been made to increase speed. In this paper a method of raising the speed of Eastman Negative Color 5248 from ASA 24 to ASA 80 without objectionable loss of contrast or color shift is described."
"The open time of a Fastax rotating-prism shutter is 40 μsec at 5000 frames/sec. Better action-stopping is achieved with a 1-μsec stroboscopic light. A 5C22 triggered by Fastax sprocket teeth discharges a 12-kv pulse-forming network into an Edgerton lamp 5000 times/sec. An area 3 × 3 ft is adequately illuminated for reflection photography with ASA 100 film at f/2.7."
"The inorganic developer system of Roman, employing divalent vanadium ion as the active developing agent, has been further investigated. A solution prepared from vanadium pentoxide, sulfuric and hydrobromic acids, and reduced by electrolysis was found to double the speed of motion-picture positive emulsions with development times of the order of 20 sec at 60 F. Other sensitometric properties can be controlled to match those produced by conventional processing. A motion-picture film-processing machine employing the vanadium developer has been devised and tested and is described. Developer activity is maintained by continuous electrolytic regeneration of the solution, with replenishment made only to balance carryover losses."
"Equations are derived for use in calculating formulas and rates of addition of replenisher solutions. Replenishment formulas and rates are determined not only by chemical reactions between constituents of the film and the solutions, but also by physical characteristics of the equipment in which the film is processed. When values for carry-over, tank volume, overflow, film velocity-chemical activity, and concentration levels are inserted in appropriate equations, replenisher formulas and rates can be calculated. The application of the equations to a typical problem is shown."
"A psychophysical study has been made of the relationship between the tone-reproduction quality of a positive motion-picture screen image and the camera exposure for the corresponding negative throughout a series of negative exposures for each of sixteen outdoor scenes and eight indoor scenes. A description is given of the method used for obtaining psychometric data, and curves are presented showing the relationship between screen image quality and the logarithm of the camera exposure. The use of these curves in determining exposure latitude, speed and exposure index is discussed."
"New solutions for the film transmission problem for both black-and-white and color are described, comprising (1) nonstorage flying-spot scanning technique, (2) continuous exposure and (3) continuous film motion combined with optical compensation. A new form of optical compensator is then discussed which is both simple and small and which provides the possibility of solutions for film-shrinkage correction and iso-film-transport. The new optical compensator is corrected for various aberrations and has good optical efficiency. A color television film scanner incorporating these features is described."
"A 16mm mechanism designed to advance the film during the vertical blanking time of the television system and its use with a flying-spot film scanner for color television is described. The order of the forces encountered is indicated. Also, solutions to certain auxiliary problems are given as well as operating characteristics and performance data."
"The CinemaScope system for the presentation of motion pictures in existent theaters has resulted from major technological advances along two facets of engineering: optics and sound reproduction. The optical aspect has given rise to the wide-screen picture. The sound reproduction aspect has yielded stereophonic sound. In the consideration of the subject the optics shall be considered the dominant factor although the sound, the screen, the film and the projection equipment are to be reviewed."
"Electrical phasing, time phasing and balanced loudness between channels are necessary for the maximum realization of the benefits of a stereophonic recording system. Elements and characteristics of two- and three-track recording and reproducing systems are briefly described."
"A New Lightweight stainless-steel developing-machine roller for 16mm and 35mm film has been devised by the Engineering Division of the National Film Board of Canada. The rollers are manufactured and supplied by The Ketchum Manufacturing Co., Ltd., P.O. Box 388, Ottawa, Canada."
"Among the many specialized duties which confront every audio-visual director is that of maintaining high-quality performance of projection equipment. Because the typical director does not have the time or the inclination to become an electronics engineer or repairman, which he needs to be if he does much work with a sound projector, he needs some objective means of judging the quality of performance or diagnosing trouble."
"Publication of this standard in May 1953 revises the original one issued in 1947. The text of the Foreword, Specification and Appendix A is reprinted below. The complete text of the Standard also includes: Appendix B, “Report on the Tests Which Formed the Basis of the First Edition (1947) of This British Standard”; Appendix C, “Report on Tests Made to Provide Data for the 1953 Edition of B. S. 1404”; and Appendix D, “Notes on the Method of Measurement Specified in Appendix A.”"
"The lighting installation of NBC Studio 8H features convenient facilities for setting up the many and varied lighting routines required by today's television shows. Efficient operation of these facilities reduces studio usage for lighting purposes, and consequently increases the number of shows which can be staged each week. This paper describes the installation, and provides a documentary account of the process of lighting a typical dramatic show."
"The transmission of an image from the original scene to the 3-D screen involves several transformations, the last of which occurs in the spectator himself. Analysis of any transmission system or theory has significance only as it pertains to the capabilities of the human visual apparatus. The spectator must be considered an integral part — the most important part — of the transmission system, and, as such, the evaluation of any system should be preceded by, and based on, a knowledge of the limitations imposed by the physiology of vision. It is the purpose of this paper to investigate some of these limitations."
"A four-track magnetic soundhead for reproducing CinemaScope films in theaters is described. The unit mounts readily between projector and upper film magazine and is film driven. To facilitate threading, the film sprocket is locked when the pressure pads are opened. A low natural-period Davis filtered drive insures high-quality film motion."
"This paper describes a new type of sound reproducer which attaches to the top of standard 35mm theater motion-picture projectors. The unit permits elective playing of conventional photographic sound films by means of the usual projector-soundhead combination or magnetic tracks by means of the attachment. Sound reproduction using the attachment is of excellent quality and falls within Research Council recommendations for magnetic-track reproduction."
"A four-track, magnetic sound reproducer which mounts between the upper magazine and the picture mechanism of a standard theater projector is described. Features include: minimum increase in overall projector height, no interference with normal projector operation and excellent film motion. The use of this unit for the initial experimental recording work which produced the first composite CinemaScope film demonstrations is also described."
"E. K. Carver (Eastman Kodak Go.): What tension is required over the magnetic head, especially in the two cases where a combination sprocket is used? How great is the tension on the film in that isolated portion?"
"Editorial Note: “Ferrite-Core Heads for Magnetic Recording” by R. J. Youngquist and W. W. Wetzel, presented at the same Convention session as this discussion on magnetic head wear, has not been released for publication. The tentative conclusions put forth at the Convention have been withdrawn because continuing tests on ferrite-core heads have not borne out the earlier hopes."
"A new portable arc projector for 16mm film, consisting of five luggage-type units, and its modification for 3-D projection, is described."
"This abridgment has been prepared for the Journal readers as a supplement to “Development of Motion-Picture Positive Film by Vanadous Ion,” by A. A. Rasch and J. I. Crabtree, in the January 1954 Journal, pp. 1–10."
"Published on the following pages are revisions of two American Standards: Z22.21–1946. Emulsion Position in Camera for 8mm Silent Motion-Picture Film; and Z22.22–1947. Emulsion Position in Projector for Direct Front Projection of 8mm Silent Motion-Picture Film. The revisions are purely editorial in nature, consisting of a change in title and use of the word “rate” in place of “speed” in paragraph 2.—H.K."
"This paper pertains to a new design of 35mm film for release purposes. The design was executed specifically for use in presentation of pictures by the Cinema-Scope system, but there is nothing which prevents the application of the film to other types of motion-picture methods. The essential features of CinemaScope film are a new, smaller perforation, and a change in the perforation transverse spacing. By this means, additional area is made available for a picture image of greater size than presently used, and for four magnetic soundtracks. The net result is an arrangement which makes for the maximum use of conventional width. The analyses, reasoning and other considerations which culminated in the design described are given in detail."
"Observer reactions are the final criteria in determining if a color photograph adequately reproduces a scene. These reactions indicate that ordinary colorimetric measurements cannot serve as the sole indication of reproduction quality. Dependence of the state of observer eye adaptation on viewing conditions has been found to overshadow simple colorimetric considerations. Adaptation requirements in color photography have been met through application of the so-called “first and second black conditions.” It will be found essential also in color television that the two black conditions be applied. In both color photography and color television, particularly the latter, a new interpretation of the two black conditions should further improve the color quality of reproduced scenes."
"The lack of a general performance criterion for projection screens is regrettable, particularly in view of recent advances in screen design. In this paper a performance rating is proposed which is based on empirical results as well as theoretical considerations. It does not stress a particular property of the screen, but rather the interaction of several factors determining the overall performance. It is shown that the new criterion gives an unbiased rating of screens of widely diverse characteristics. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by concrete examples. In the application to a class of absorbing screens, certain limitations may exist whose analysis calls for further experimental evidence. The results discussed reveal the surprisingly large margin left for possible improvements in screens."
"It is pointed out that the trend of modern electronic flash equipment is toward longer flash duration. After proposing a method of defining duration, an approximate method of calculating duration is given, together with resistance constants of commonly available flashtubes. Some information is given regarding the production of short flashes of light in the microsecond and submicrosecond range."
"The paper discusses a new multiple, sound stage design which increases production efficiency by providing both centralized facilities and an acoustic isolation, permitting set construction and preparation on one or more stages while producing on an adjacent stage. The methods of obtaining the acoustic isolation are described, together with other novel features."
"The need for an adequate color-compensating light source for direct color printing resulted in the development of a flag-type subtractive light changer, complete with lamp, optical system, filter pack and blower system, and modulating the light path with four interchangeable flag units. Each unit is mounted with the proper filters and is actuated by an electrical-signal device working from a perforated tape. This unit has been adapted to continuous, step and optical printers."
"This paper describes a means of actuating scene-to-scene light changes in motion-picture printing. A conducting tape is applied to the printing negative by a special punch. This cues an electronic device which fires the light changing mechanism. The electronic device has a delay circuit which assures adequate time for the completion of the light-change operation."
"A button-on recorder-reproducer unit for a 16mm commercial projector using perforated ¼-in. magnetic tape as the medium for sound is described. The performance of the unit recommends perforated tape as a satisfactory medium for synchronized recording."
"A method is described of plotting the light-time curves of flash-discharge tubes using purely photographic methods. Particular attention is given to tubes with flashes of the order of 5- to 10-μsec effective duration, but some results for longer duration tubes are included. The method has been employed to examine for a certain tube the influence on the effective photographic duration of the use of emulsions of widely different spectral sensitivity and speed. For the particular emulsions chosen the observed differences in effective flash duration are of small magnitude and insignificant in practice. Some observations are included of the influence of different capacities on total photographically effective light output (i.e. efficiency). The changes in duration and efficiency resulting from some different gas fillings in tubes which are otherwise identical are also recorded."
"High-quality projector filters and viewers are essential to full audience enjoyment of 3-D motion-picture shows. Projector filters of improved type are now in production and constitute an excellent solution to the problems presented by high temperature and high light intensity. Being glass-laminated, they are easily cleaned and thus should last indefinitely. Viewers of excellent polarization characteristics, color neutrality and stability are available. Some minimum performance specifications are proposed, in the interest of insuring that all spectators are enabled to see 3-D presentations with full effectiveness. Optical “leakage” and chemical instability, present in some types of viewers are especially to be avoided."
"A 3-D motion-picture screen, besides reflecting the two incident beams with good gain throughout a reasonably wide lobe, must conserve the polarization tagging of the beams. Tests on 100 screen samples show that the majority of screens of normal design meet these requirements excellently — for viewing angles not exceeding about 20° from the screen normal. Thus these screens are very satisfactory for use in narrow theaters. For 45° viewing, such as occurs in wide theaters, screens of this type usually have rather low gain and their polarization defect values approach a harmful level. Lenticulated screens, however, tend to avoid these difficulties and thus go a long way toward solving the wide-theater problem. There are several different designs of lenticulated screens, each having certain advantages and disadvantages."
"Equipment is described that permits the projectionist to obtain and maintain perfect synchronism in the projection of 3-D motion pictures. This is accomplished without stopping the show or otherwise interfering with the continuity and quality of the projection. The equipment is of two basic types: synchronization monitors and synchronization controls. The monitor is used to measure the direction and amount of the synchronization error, and the control is then used to correct the error."
"This paper discusses the use of a vidicon camera tube for film pickup and describes special operating techniques for obtaining best performance. The operating principles of the vidicon are reviewed briefly and performance characteristics are given. Basic features desired for satisfactory reproduction of film on television are discussed, including high signal-to-noise ratio, “built-in” gamma of the proper magnitude, accurate black-level reproduction, excellent resolution, and freedom from spurious signals."
"Analysis and experience show that an ideal device for television film reproduction should have high resolution, excellent signal-to-noise ratio, wide contrast range, a stable gamma characteristic with a slope of 0.6 and good black-level control. It should operate with standard television projectors. Our work during the past two years has convinced us that the vidicon camera comes closest to this ideal. In addition to the characteristics already mentioned, the vidicon camera can be operated nonsynchronously, making it possible to provide local film inserts in network programming. The sensitivity for film operation is approximately three times greater than with the iconoscope, providing a large increase in projector lamp life. The simplicity and stability of a vidicon camera system make it very attractive for “unattended” operation with a minimum of adjustment and attention. — A particular form of vidicon film camera with its deflection, video and control circuits is described and illustrated. The problems and possible solutions of optical and electrical multiplexing for typical television broadcast operation are discussed. A broadcasting requirement for the reproduction of transparencies, opaques and other more specialized opaque presentations can be filled by equipment which is now in a product-development phase. We believe that, with the developments now available, the television broadcaster can provide picture quality in this field comparable with the best live pickup performance with equipment requiring only nominal attention and skill."
"This Report will review progress since the last formal report of the Committee presented to the Society at its October 1952 meeting.1 It will also summarize the present status of various projects on the occasion of the completion of the writer's term of office as Chairman."
"A new system for lip synchronizing has been designed by the Signal Corps Pictorial Center, using a magnetic stripe on the composite print from which the individual loops are made. This permits immediate synchronous playbacks with any length of loop, so that corrections can be made on the spot. The need for subsequent editing is thereby reduced or may be eliminated entirely. By reassembling the recorded loops into a complete reel, it is possible to eliminate all photographic ra stock and processing except for the final release negative, thereby achieving great economies in film consumption and editorial costs. Furthermore, since the projector becomes a recording machine as ell, the regular recording equipment is released for other work."
"U.S. Army films, training, informational or documentary, have been prepared in foreign languages since 1942, at the Signal Corps Pictorial Center. Foreign versions of U.S. Army films are produced in various languages for use by our military missions in those countries where we are assisting in the training of national armies. Narration and lip synchronization are used, depending on whether the original film is of the narrative, off-screen type or dialogue, situation type. Superimposed subtitles are not used in foreign versions of military films because of the necessity of retaining, in translation, the entire content of the scenario or script."
"Techniques employed at the Naval Photographic Center, using a specially built, one-unit, 16mm photomagnetic projector and photomagnetic duplicator are described. Its use for recording (while projecting) on 16mm half-stripe composite prints, in foreign-language conversion, is reviewed. Sizable savings in time and material are realized."
"A new equipment has been designed to reduce the difficulty and expense of recording foreign-language translations on American films for export. Sound effects and music are printed on the film as a photographic half-width sound record and the other half of the sound record space striped for magnetic recording of the foreign language. The projector is designed to reproduce photographic and magnetic sound records on either soundhead or on both simultaneously. The magnetic recording head allows the foreign language to be recorded on the striping after the photographic recording is printed on the film."
"A new 35mm camera for recording television sound and picture is described. Included among the features of the camera are a 51° pulldown, adjustable shutter and high-quality sound recording mechanism. A discussion of the technical considerations in the design of a kinescope recording camera is included."
"A new tracking telescope type of optical recording instrument has been developed for missile programs at white Sands Proving Ground. The versatility of the instrument is discussed on the basis of different cameras and optical systems which may be used on the same basic mount. The possibility of its use as a cinetheodolite of moderate precision is also noted."
"Improvement in service reliability is a factor in power transmission and distribution which has received considerable emphasis in recent years. Several means for obtaining improvement in service reliability are in general use. These include ground-fault neutralizers, immediate reclosing of circuit breakers, overhead and buried ground wires, arresters and expulsion protector tubes. All have demonstrated an ability to limit outages on transmission and distribution systems. None of these means considered, however, has shown a perfect record in all cases of application."
"This test code has been prepared in the hope that it will serve as a useful guide for the evaluation of insulation systems for random wound rotating electric machines, and to establish a sound basis for their temperature classification. Once this is accomplished in orderly and organized fashion, the problems of insulation selection for use in electric apparatus should be simplified. The code defines test procedures. It does not establish any normal values for insulation life, nor does it provide any standards of performance whatever."
"IN A TELEVISION SYSTEM, it is through the agency of the scanning process that the two-dimensional space function, comprising the image at the camera, is transformed into a one-dimensional time function for transmission; at the receiver, the reverse procedure is used to recreate the image. Ideally, the velocities of the scanning apertures should be uniform in both the horizontal and vertical directions; furthermore, these two directions of motion should be orthogonal at all points in the raster. Finally, the ratio of the maximum excursions of the apertures in the horizontal and vertical directions of the transmitted picture, i.e., the aspect ratio, should be the same at both the transmitter and receiver. If there is departure from any of these conditions, geometric distortion results (except in the trivial case where the transmitter and receiver happen to contain compensating errors). It should also be noted that even in the case where the scanning aperture itself meets the desired conditions, the optical systems may contribute to the total geometric distortion; this applies to either the transmitter or receiver."
"Presents the title page of the proceedings record."
"Presents the table of contents/splash page of the proceedings record."
"The eighteenth volume of the “Digest of Literature on Dielectrics” covers the literature issued during the calendar year of 1954 and, in a few cases, previous years."
"The field of science and engineering which deals with electrical insulation, its properties, and its applications, is indeed a diversified one, as is demonstrated by the table of contents of this Digest. Consequently, it is difficult to decide whether one accomplishment contributes more to our understanding of the field than another. However, the authors of the various chapters of the Digest have assisted in this decision by listing those recent developments which they consider to be among the most important. These are summarized in what follows."
"Two important and comprehensive books on the subject of dielectrics and dielectric measurements have been written by one of the foremost authorities in the field, Prof. von Hippel (1, 2). One book, entitled Dielectrics and Waves, is divided into two sections, one in which electromagnetic waves and their interaction with dielectric materials are thoroughly discussed, and another in which the molecular theory of dielectrics is very ably presented. This book is an invaluable reference source and will contribute significantly to the advancement of the art. The companion book, entitled Dielectric Materials and Applications, is primarily concerned with the measurement and application of dielectrics. An important feature of this book is the table of dielectric properties it contains. The properties of more than 600 dielectrics at frequencies between 100 cycles and 25,000 Mc and at various temperatures are tabulated. The book is based on lectures on dielectrics given by twenty-two experts at a Summer Session Course of the Laboratory for Insulation Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in September 1952."
"These tables contain all references to dipole moments and to static dielectric constants of pure liquids contained in Chemical Abstracts from January 1953 to December 1954 and not included in the previously published tables. In the table of dipole moments the compounds are divided into the following groups: a. Inorganic b. Hydrocarbons c. Organic compounds containing one or more halogens d. Organic compounds containing oxygen and may contain halogens e. Organic compounds containing nitrogen and may contain oxygen and/or halogens f. Organic compounds containing boron, phosphorous, sulfur, selenium or silicon and may contain oxygen, nitrogen and/or halogens g. Camphor derivatives h. Tropolone derivatives"
"A majority of the work in the field covered by this chapter is usually concerned in one way or another with the properties of liquids. The ever-expanding family of mechanical models continues to increase; the physics of the liquid state has not yet been reduced to terms where theoretical laws could be readily derived without the use of rather limiting assumptions, or, in some cases, arbitrary constants, and the interaction of electrical energy with liquids is no exception."
"Electrical conduction is a broad subject by itself and includes phenomena in metals, semiconductors and dielectrics. To be consistent with the title of this Digest we include in the present chapter information on conduction phenomena only in those substances which we feel are sufficiently good insulators, intrinsically, to pass as dielectrics."
"The influence of the nature of the cathode metal upon the breakdown of liquid dielectrics has been studied by many investigators. However, the sensitivity of the electron emission characteristics of a metal to the physical and chemical condition of its surface makes it very difficult to obtain reproducible results, Bragg, Sharbaugh, and Crowe (1) have attempted to bypass this difficulty by using an electrolyte solution as a cathode; the amount of emission is controlled by the concentration of the electrolyte in solution. Consideration of the space charge formation leads to a qualitative theory which predicts the manner in which the electric strength of a liquid will depend upon the concentration of the solution used as cathode. Experimental verification of this theory is provided by a study of the variation in the electric strength of benzene when measured with a series of aqueous LiCl solutions which have different concentrations (10−5 to 5N)."
"The knowledge of ferroelectric materials continued to expand in a number of directions during 1954. Promising piezoelectric properties were found by a National Bureau of Standards group (97) in lead titanate-lead zirconate ferroelectrics. The most noteworthy development in research on barium titanate is a great increase of interest in the growth of single crystals. Structural data on Rochelle salt and KH2PO4, especially those obtained by neutron diffraction, continues to add to the store of fundamental knowledge of ferroelectrics."
"In the present section, attention is confined to ferromagnetic materials that are nonmetallic. The materials dealt with are characterized by a resultant spontaneous moment that ordinarily is due to an uncompensated antiferromagnetism. Such substances are more properly designated as ferricmagnetic."
"This section is a review of rubber and plastic research and developments in the electrical insulation field as described by 1954 literature. Information is included on research and development trends, materials and their application, processes, and instrumentation. In the earlier issues of the Digest, separate sections on rubber and plastic materials were presented. However, in recent years many variations and combinations of rubber and plastic materials have been used and it was difficult at times to separate the information into its specific section. It is hoped that by combining the sections a more thorough coverage will be accomplished."
"In this chapter, the literature reviewed includes that on unsupported films as well as the products of both organic and inorganic fibers in the form of sheet and yarn. The coverage is intended to include all articles judged to be pertinent to this special area of dielectric materials."
"With the exception of references (2) and (32) on the use of synthetic insulating liquids, this digest is concerned with mineral insulating oils. In that group, references originating in France are unusually comprehensive in the fields of action covered, and in the thoroughness of coverage. For example, the October 1954 issue of Bulletin de la Société Francaise des Electriciens contains four papers on tests and uses of transformer oils, as well as two papers dealing with oil deterioration and regeneration in Pirelli type oil-filled cables. The CIGRE (Conference Internationale des Grands Reseaux Electriques a Haute Tension) Meeting in Paris in the early summer of 1954 yielded seven references on insulating oils and their applications. The CIGRE papers are assembled eventually in the bound Proceedings of the 1954 meeting."
"Comeforo and Hatch (1) found that the dielectric properties of hot pressed synthetic mica were comparable to those of other ceramic insulators up to 400°C. Emphasis was placed on testing a dielectric at the temperature to which it will be exposed. Evidence of a transition temperature, as indicated by a break in curves obtained by plotting logarithm of an electrical property versus the reciprocal of absolute temperature, was not verified."
"Presents the front cover or splash screen of the proceedings record."
"The following topics are dealt with: fluorogas dielectric behavior;corona; wire; gas-solid dielectric system; discharge inception voltage; barium titanate single crystal dielectric behavior; ferroelectric loop tracer; ferromagnetic semiconductor electric strength measurement; liquid hydrocarbon electric breakdown; insulating liquid ;oil; impulse creepage propagation mechanism; insulator; dielectric loss measurement; dielectric absorption; insulation aging characteristic ;shearing modulus; polar liquid dielectric direct current conductivity; Beta radiation effect ;ceramic surface resistivity ;organic material ;insulating material; lower aliphatic alcohols dielectric property ;dielectric relaxation ;silicone glass fiber; dry type transformer system; functional temperature endurance test ; and silicone rubber."
"Conference proceedings front matter may contain various advertisements, welcome messages, committee or program information, and other miscellaneous conference information. This may in some cases also include the cover art, table of contents, copyright statements, title-page or half title-pages, blank pages, venue maps or other general information relating to the conference that was part of the original conference proceedings."
"It has been known for a long time that the gases containing Fluorine have in general a higher dielectric strength relative to air and therefore offer practical applications as dielectrics. For instance, sulfur hexafluoride has been used to insulate X-ray transformers, Van de Graaff and telephone cables."
"The negative corona extinction voltage or breakdown extinction voltage has been determined in air and SF6 at atmospheric pressure for the sphere to plane configuration. Spheres or points ranging in size from a 0.250\" radius sphere to a 0.0024\" radius phonograph needle were used with gaps of the order of 1-10 millimeters. The negative corona extinction voltage was also determined for the coaxial cylinder configuration in air and SF6 at atmospheric pressure for inner cylinders ranging in radius from 0.050\" to 0.0012\" and an outer cylinder of 0.250\" or 0.500\" diameter. The corona or breakdown extinction field is calculated from the above data as a function of the radius. The ratio of the field at which corona starts in SF5 to the field at which corona starts in air decreases from about 2.4 to 1.4 as the field becomes more non-uniform. The smaller the radius of the electrode the nearer is the value of the SF5 corona field to that of the air corona field."
"The absolute magnitude of the coulomb or electron charge in a corona pulse can be obtained from a measurement of the instantaneous voltage change produced by the pulse on the device, or test piece. This voltage, ΔV, is most easily measured by measuring the maximum amplitude of the damped high frequency oscillation generated across a small inductor connected in series with the test piece showing corona. The charge in the pulse is given by Q = C Δ V, where C is the effective capacitance across which the Δ V appears."
"This is essentially a continuation of a paper I presented before this group in 1948 and which was printed, with discussions, in the June 1949 Electrical Engineering. Much debate has occurred on the extent to which failure of an insulated single conductor is governed by the maximum stress or the average stress and the relation of failure voltage to the geometry. The behaviors with d-c, a-c, and impulse voltage are all different."
"While there are many factors that influence the discharge inception voltage, commonly known as corona start voltage (CSV), in gas-solid dielectric systems, only three or four will be brought out here. Some of these factors are not new, but will be presented somewhat differently in hopes that those who deal in the direct application of dielectrics to practical systems may find a little better tool with which to work."
"A sufficiently high a.c. voltage impressed upon a sample of dielectric containing a void will result in discharges (corona) in the void, and thus to degradation of the dielectric. The discharge current is in the form of very rapid pulses, <; 0.1 μsec in duration, and it is the ultimate purpose of this work to examine the factors controlling the number and size of these pulses and to correlate these quantities with the chemical degradation obtained."
"The non-linearity of the dielectric behavior of Barium Titanate single crystals above the 120°C transition has been investigated in the temperature range 120°C to 150°C. The single crystals used in this experiment were grown in our laboratory. They are characterized by a very high peak of the dielectric constant at the Curie point (16,000)."
"Mason(1) and Caspari and Merz(2) have made measurements of the electromechanical properties of barium titanate. Working with polycrystalline ceramics Mason(1) observed only a second order electro-strictive effect, since the first order piezoelectric effect was annulled because of the random orientation of crystal axes. Caspari and Merz(2) made static and dynamic electromechanical measurements on single domain crystals. However, their dynamic measurements were performed on small irregularly shaped crystals, which did not allow them to observe fundamental modes of vibration, and an absolute determination of the physical constants was impossible."
"In the usual technique for the display of ferroelectric hysteresis loops, the specimen is excited from a sinusoidal a.c. voltage source, signals proportional to D and E are derived and these are respectively applied to the vertical and horizontal deflection plates of a cathode ray oscilloscope. Ordinarily, the frequency of excitation is 60 c.p.s., the choice being purely one of convenience. Actually, it would be preferable to obtain a plot of the quasi-static loop except where one is specifically interested in frequency dependent hysteresis effects. Quasi-static loops can be obtained by a point by point ballistic method, but this is a tedious procedure and there is always the uncertainty in distinguishing between the effects of the polarization current and the conduction current."
"A broad-band spectral analysis was undertaken of the dielectric properties of ferrites (polarization, magnetization and conduction) from d.c. to the optical spectral region. After a short description of the various measurement techniques employed, characteristic data are given of electronic conduction, space-charge polarization, infrared absorption, and ferromagnetic resonance. Various additional resonance and relaxation effects are discussed, which, in addition, may shape the very complicated frequency-response characteristics. The effect of structure and cation distribution of the ferromagnetic semiconductors on the electric and magnetic properties are also considered."
"The physical processes operative in the development of electrical breakdown in a dielectric are often reflected in the time interval between the application of a d.c. voltage and the appearance of the spark. This time may include both the time required for a free electron to appear near the cathode (statistical time lag) and the time required for the spark to develop after such an electron begins to multiply by collision ionization (formative time lag). It is the latter that provides the most information about the breakdown process."
"The intent of this paper is to point out the need for a careful analysis of some of the theories concerned with the life characteristics of liquid insulation of petroleum origin. Data pertaining directly to one type of liquid commonly known as transformer oil are used but the basic principles involved are not necessarily restricted to transformer oils."
"The results of a study of the propagation mechanism of impulse creepage discharges over oil-immersed Kraft board is reported in this paper. This study was carried out using Leica and high-speed Boys cameras to record the progression of the discharges and using a special probe technique to measure the discharge potentials at various points along the channel. The electrode configuration used in these experiments consisted of a rod electrode on one side of a sheet of one-eighth inch Kraft board and a grounded copper surface deposited on the opposite side. Capacitance probes were imbedded in the copper surface to measure the approximate potentials of streamers passing along the rod side of the insulation. Impulse waves (1.5 × 7000 μsec) were applied to the rod at 120 kv which was about three times the corona starting level. The entire test structure was placed in a lucite tank filled with commercial quality insulating oil. Photographs of the discharges were made through the walls of the tank by means of a slit and mirror arrangement. The Kraft board insulation used in these tests was first impregnated with oil under vacuum, and transferred to the testing tank just before tests were begun."
"The possibility of obtaining oxidation-ions from aromatic hydrocarbons was investigated. Ozone at room temperature and without a catalyst was used as an oxidizing agent. Under these conditions no increase in electrical conductivity is observed. If, however, a small amount of an aliphatic acid is added prior to the oxidation, a very large increase in electrical conductivity is found."
"Haworth and Bozorth, as well as von Hippel, many years ago observed that the prebreakdown current in dielectrics may be accompanied by characteristic noise phenomena of a not clearly established origino Lately, several scientists have ascribed this noise to impact ionization in the dielectric and deduced the number and height of these avalanches from it. This interpretation appears very doubtful, because the onset of impact ionization in the presence of field emission should normally lead to breakdown(l). To clarify the situation, the present authors have investigated the origin of the noise and its frequency spectrum in some detail."
"A new instrument has been developed which displays simultaneously on two meters the difference in magnitude and phase angle between an unknown and a standard impedance. These impedances may be resistors, capacitors, inductors, or any complex impedance. No balancing operation is used, but instead the vector components of the bridge unbalance voltage are measured and displayed independently."
"In 1949 a paper was presented before this Conference on Electrical Insulation giving the results of measurements of volume and surface conductivities made on Polystyrene, Polymethylmethacrylate and Polyvinylbutyral under standard room conditions. The use of a vibrating reed electrometer in place of a more sluggish quadrant electrometer has permitted a more detailed study of the current flow through dielectric specimens having very low conductivities, Dr. Paul Ehrlich has recently published a paper(1) on results obtained with the vibrating reed electrometer in which the change of volume conductivity with time was followed from a few seconds up to 104 seconds, for Polystyrene and Polymethylmethacrylate. In the work now being described measurements were made of both volume and surface conductivities at various relative humidities. The materials on which measurements were made are Diallyl Phthalate, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Polystyrene and Teflon."
"A new method is described for determining the effect of thermal aging on the shearing modulus of flexible sheet insulations by non-destructive tests using a torsion pendulum technique. The test sample consists of a twelve-inch length of the material under test clamped between two pairs of inertia bars of different weight and inertia."
"The increase in viscosity of a polar liquid which occurs when a constant electric field is applied across the capillary in which the liquid is flowing saturates at a high field intensity, and no further viscosity increase occurs (fig. 1(a)). This saturation effect has a long time-constant, and disappears if a very low frequency field of 1 c.p.s. is substituted for the D. C, field (fig. 1(b)); this behaviour is inconsistent with the theory that the viscosity increase is a spurious electrode effect."
"The purpose of this paper is to describe some effects of beta radiation on the conductivity σ of good insulators (i.e. σ<; 10-17mho/cm) as a function of radiation rate, total irradiation time and temperature. The historical background will first be given; then, some recent measurements will be described and related to theory; and, finally, some practical applications will be discussed."
"The direct current surface resistivities of some ceramic and organic materials at 91 and 100 per cent relative humidity were evaluated. Particular emphasis was devoted to the study of glazed high alumina ceramics from many of the commercial sources."
"Silver possesses a combination of properties which encourages its use for a variety of purposes in electrical components such as electrical contacts, printed circuits, and metal-ceramic combinations. Its electrical resistivity is 17 × 10-6 as compared with 21.3 × 10-6 for copper and 30.8 × 10-6 for gold. Its oxide decomposes at temperatures slightly above 100°C where the dissociation pressure equals the partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere. The free energy of formation of the oxide at room temperature is -2395 calories as compared with -26,000 for copper. For these reasons silver has some of the properties of noble metals. Unfortunately, it has two very undesirable and potentially hazardous properties. It combines with sulfides under certain conditions to form surface films of sulfides which are permeable to silver and, therefore, continue to increase in thickness, resulting in high electrical contact resistance. The second undesirable property is the high solubility of the oxide in water which is probably the basis of the tendency for silver to migrate in electrical fields. The term silver migration as employed here may be defined as the electrolytic transport of silver from its initial location and its deposition as metallic silver in some other location. The deposited silver may assume several different forms-1) dendritic structures which normally develop from cathodic areas; 2) colloidally deposited silver in the form of conducting or non-conducting films in the vicinity of either the cathode or the anode; 3) dendritic or colloidal deposits detached from either the cathode or the anode. In this investigation the test specimen was clamped between two sets of silver bar electrodes one inch long and 3/16 inch wide so as to provide a leakage path 1/8 inch long running parallel to the specimen which was in the form of a strip one inch widen Migration occurs either at the surface of the sheet in the case of nonporous materials or through the material in the case of fiberous or porous materials. The specimens clamped between the two sets of electrodes were supported from the cap of a bottle maintained at constant temperature and. containing salt solutions of the desired relative humidity. A d.c. voltage of 45 or 200 volts was then applied to the test specimen and the progress of migration followed by resistance measurements and by visual observation."
"Measurements of dielectric constants and loss in seven alcohols (from methyl to secondary butyl) have been made at frequencies from 15 c/s to 2 Mc/s over considerable ranges of temperature to extreme values of -150°C and 110°C. Also, solutions of water in ethyl and iso-propyl alcohols and of methyl with n-propyl alcohol have been studied."
"For the investigation of the relations between dielectric properties and molecular characteristics, the tetrahalogenated methanes provide a series of molecules which deviate in shape only a little from that of a sphere and in dipole moment only a little from zero. The dielectric constants of many of them have been measured in the liquid and solid states over a wide range of temperature at a frequency of 5 kilocycles, and, when not too volatile for the available apparatus, their dielectric constants and losses have been measured in the liquid state at wavelengths of 1.24, 3.22 cm., and, occasionally, 10 cm., and used to calculate the critical wavelengths, at which the loss is a maximum, and the corresponding relaxation times. The molecular dipole moments have been calculated from the loss data, and the viscosities of the liquids have been measured."
"The physical properties of succinonitril, NCCH2CH2CN, have made it suitable for inclusion in a program of research at microwave frequencies on solids possessing high dielectric constants because of the rotational freedom of their polar molecules. At radio frequencies, White and Morgan found no drop in the high dielectric constant when liquid, succinonitrile solidified at 54.2°C. Below the freezing point, the radio-frequency or static dielectric constant rose from a value above 50 to one above 80 at -42.6°, where it dropped abruptly in a 2.3° range to a low value typical of non-polar compounds, the optical dielectric constant."
"The problems encountered with dielectric materials presently used in submarine antenna systems emphasize the need for improved materials. It is essential that a submarine be able to transmit its message as soon as the small whip antenna, for example, breaks water. The antenna insulator not only may have an accumulated coating of dirt from prolonged exposure to the weather but also may have been submerged for many hours under substantial hydrostatic pressure; thus it is likely to be dirty as well as wet as it surfaces. Under these conditions, an insulator made of the currently standard fluorocarbon may have an arbitrary insulation resistance of only one megohm with the result that some 90% of the power applied to the antenna is lost in surface leakage."
"Temperature classification of insulating materials by functional tests is now a reality rather than an ideal. With the advent of many new binding and impregnating resins such as the epoxy, silicones and polytetra-fluoroethylene, the task becomes hopeless in establishing temperatures on an organic or inorganic basis as has been done in the pasto Hence, the reasons are clear for the recent actions by the A. I. E. E. and N. E. M. A. standardizing groups in suggesting evaluation of insulation systems for transformers established on a temperature basis. This paper describes tests and behavior of a composite silicone glass fiber insulation system throng}, 350°C temperature used in 15 KV class dry type transformers. Thirteen model transformers were subjected to load cycling by circulation of current in the windings to obtain hottest spot temperatures. Each cycle consisted of standard test voltages prescribed for 15 KV class insulation, followed by aging temperature 48 hours, by full test voltage by 90 percent humidity 24 hours, and by full test voltage within 30 minutes of humidification. Aging temperatures were 200°C, 275°C and 350°C. Thermocouple and power factor readings were obtained for all component parts of the insulation structure. These tests duplicate actual service conditions in much more severity. Such a procedure builds confidence in the performance of insulation from the users as well as the manufacturers point of view. It substantiates recent action by N. E. M. A. in establishing 180°C hottest spot rise temperature (220°C maximum total temperature) for such an insulating system."
"This material, known as Silastic S-2007, is a solvent-free compound that will flow under its own weight. It is a conventional heat reactive silicone rubber vulcanizing at temperatures of 240F and above. The outstanding property of S-2007 is its ability to vulcanize in relatively deep sections without sponging."
"General Electric Company has introduced a new type of silicone rubber coating compound SE 100 to the field of electrical insulation. This material and silicone rubber-glass cloth products made therefrom represent a significant advance in the industry. Through a study of the components parts of the coating formulation-polymer base, filler, and curing agent - and the rheological properties deemed necessary, the product was developed."
